A549 cells, a human lung carcinoma cell line that retains properties of HRSV-permissive alveolar cells, were used in this study. Due to its respiratory origin, this cell line has been extensively used in the characterization of HRSV-infection and in the proteomic analysis of cellular and infectious respiratory diseases [9, 10, [20] [21] [22] . Mock-infected cells were grown in media labeled with R6K4 (Dundee Cell Products) and cells infected with subgroup B virus (at a multiplicity of infection of 1) were grown in media containing R0K0. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were harvested 24 h postinfection. This time point was chosen to compare to other proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of HRSV-infected cells and also to ensure that the cells were approximately 75% confluent and not undergoing contact inhibition. In addition, at this multiplicity of infection and time point, little sign of cell death was apparent, probably reflecting that HRSV can delay apoptosis under certain conditions [23, 24] . Cell pellets were re-suspended in a cold cytoplasmic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA 0.5% NP-40, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) and incubated for 10 min on ice.

Several other proteins of interest were used to validate the data set and may also indicate that cut-off values lower than 2.0-fold could be considered. For example, in the quantitative proteomic analysis, nucleolin was shown to decrease 1.6-fold in the nuclear fraction prepared from HRSV-infected cells, compared with mock-infected cells, a result validated using immunoblot analysis (Supporting Information Fig. 1 ). Indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that nucleolin was absent from the nucleus/nucleolus of some infected cells at 24 h post-infection and from all infected cells at 44 h post-infection (example images are shown in Fig. 2) . Nucleolin was also reported to be decreased at 24 h post-infection in A549 cells infected with human metapneumovirus [10] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 851, "end": 855, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 936, "end": 940, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1042, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1918, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 64, "end": 72, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 276, "end": 284, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1547, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1794, "text": "Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Keywords:"}, {"text": "In the quantitative proteomic analysis, caveolin was increased 1.7-fold in the cytoplasmic fraction prepared from HRSV-infected cells, compared with mock-infected cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Keywords:"}, {"text": "Again, examples could be found using indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy where the relative fluorescence of caveolin was greater in HRSV-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 2) .

Here, based on this analysis, van Diepen et al. [10] proposed four processes in virus-induced apoptosis: virus uptake and infection, stress response, disruption of cellular structures and cell death by apoptosis. The quantitative proteomic analysis conducted here would support this hypothesis, particularly with regard to disruption of mitochondria and nucleoli, the latter of which has been observed in proteomic analysis of other virus-infected cells [18, 19, 27] . Such changes may have functional consequences for host-cell biology. For example, nucleolin is a major constituent of the nucleolus and functions as a possible hub protein [47] .
