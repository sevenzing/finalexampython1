However, clinical research is rapidly progressing, as shown by the hundreds of registered clinical trials on candidate drugs for COVID-19. Unfortunately, information on protocols of individual studies differs from registry to registry. Furthermore, study designs, criteria for stratification of patients and choice of outcomes are quite heterogeneous. All this makes data sharing and secondary analysis difficult.At last, small single centre studies and the use of drugs on a compassionate basis should be replaced by highly powered, multi-centre, multi-arm clinical trials, in orderto provide the required evidence of safety and efficacy of novel or repurposed candidate drugs.",

Twenty-three registered studies 9 are evaluating the use of systemic corticosteroids in COVID- 19 . Despite concern about possible detrimental effects 10, 11 , there is yet no evidence for or against their use in COVID-19 patients. There is rational to speculate that their safety and efficacy may be different in the early viral phase compared to the late inflammatory phase.

However, despite the accelerated development pathways adopted by many regulatory bodies 41 , the marketing authorization pathway for new drugs is a long process, with a high attrition rate. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in repurposing existing drugs -such as antiviral and immunosuppressant agents -for use in COVID-198 . Studies with these drugs should keep in consideration the putative mechanisms of action of the investigational drug in relation to the different phases of COVID-19. Antiviral agents, for example, should be used during the early viral phase of the disease while immunosuppressant may be promising candidate drugs in the severe inflammatory phase (while they might dampen the immune response if used early on15 ). Combination or sequential treatment might also be considered.An interesting alternative strategy for drugs repurposing in COVID-19 is represented by a structural analysis of available medicines with potential inhibitory effects on molecules involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication 1,2 . In an in-silico molecular modelling screening of 2000 FDA approved drugs for potential inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 main protease enzyme (Mpro), the top hits bound to the central site of Mpro substrate-binding pocket included antiviral drugs such as Darunavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir.Interestingly, the top hits bound to the terminal site of Mpro substrate-binding pocket included Montelukast and Fexofenadine 42 . Independently from the practical impact of the above observation, this strategy appears promising in repositioning available drugs, until novel targeted treatments for COVID-19 are available.",
