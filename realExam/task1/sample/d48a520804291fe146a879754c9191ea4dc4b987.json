The access to the non-ventilated lung was occluded to avoid dispersion of droplets or aerosol [6] . After opening the thorax, the non-dependent lung was not adequately deflated, rendering the operating field challenging for the thoracic surgeons, even though ventilation was not delivered in the aforementioned lung. At that point, it was deemed essential for the patient's safety to make the upper lung deflate, by opening the corresponding connector, thus allowing a communication of the patient's lower respiratory system with the environment of the OR. In order to decrease the amount of the aerosol-contamination, a HEPA pleated hydrophobic filter was employed in the bronchial connector (Hydro-Guard Mini Breathing Filter, INTERSURGICAL). Specifically, a disposable bronchial connector was utilised, for the appropriate connection of the HEPA filter. The first step was to cut the bronchial connector obliquely ( Figure 1A) . In that way, it acquired a suitable shape which enabled wedging in the bronchial (non ventilated) lumen of the DLT by advancing it with rotating moves and, subsequently, the HEPA filter was connected to the tube connector ( Figure 1B Connectors from smaller ETTs could not be wedged firmly, whereas connectors from larger ETTs could not fit at all (Figure 3) .",
