Under the assumption of the official 3.14% death rate and doubling 40 time of 2.54 days (which was derived based on Chinese official data), the infection cases reached 41 2.2 million on February 7. The estimates of cumulative deaths, based on both funeral urns 42 distribution and continuous full capacity operation of cremation services up to March 23, 2020, 43 give results around 36,000, more than 10 times of the official death toll of 2,524. : medRxiv preprint 4 BACKGROUND 59 The spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global public health crisis 60 affecting all aspects of individual, societal and economic activity. On December 31, 2019, the 61 Wuhan City Health Commission announced that recent cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology 62 seen in some hospitals were related to the Wet Market and 27 cases were found by the time. This 63 official announcement conflicted with at least two official numbers and one media report which 64 were 45, 104 and 266 cases. 1-3 Reports from the official Chinese state-run media on February 2, 65 2020 showing large numbers of possible coronavirus victims who were not treated within the 66 medical establishment and hence may have fallen outside of government statistics, have led 67 many to believe there may be serious gaps in our understanding of the outbreak based on what 68 can be determined from this official government data. 4 69 As the epicenter of the COVID-19 initial outbreak, the epidemiological information from 70 Wuhan affects the response and preparation of other parts of China and rest of the world. It is 71 therefore important to attempt to accurately assess the actual number of cases and gain some 72 insights from this deduction to the time of the first cases. 73 The purpose of this report is to investigate the epidemiological information of the early 74 phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, after lockdown on January 23, 2019, based on 75 official Chinese government figures, published literature and media reports, focusing on 76 cremation related data. The estimates of incidence and deaths are higher by a magnitude of at 77 least 10 times the official figures. Our estimates are further supported by others who were also 78 investigating the situation and recent updates of funeral urn distribution in Wuhan. : medRxiv preprint impact of this discrepancy is critical for both the medical projection of needs and for policy 80 decisions relating to public health. 81 82 METHODS 83 Data Sources 84 The official Chinese government figures include national and local Wuhan data 5 and 85 state-run media reports. Since there is no medical literature on \"COVID-19, cremation\" in 86 China, we also searched on the internet for media reports in Chinese by \"\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u80ba\u708e\" (novel 87 coronavirus pneumonia) and \"Wuhan\" on the operation of crematory facilities in Wuhan as 88 widely reported by established news organizations both inside and outside of China. 6-12 89 Cremation Data 90 Daily cremation due to the COVID-19 outbreak is defined and estimated by total number 91 of estimated cremations in the time period of this study minus pre-outbreak average daily 92 cremations.",

The estimated \"implied start dates\" are consistent 276 with other reports where Kristian Andersen suggested a possible \"start date\" of October 1, 2019 277 based viral genome analysis. 35 Under the assumption of 2.54 doubling time, the implied start 278 date is December 14, 2019. However, in this scenario the infection cases were projected to total 279 2.23 million by February 7, 2020. If the doubling time 2.54 is close to the truth, then China's 280 official data under reported by millions. If the doubling time 6.4 is close to the truth, there was 281 significant under-and delayed reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic information by China in late 282 January and early February, the critical time for the world to respond and prepare for the 283 pandemic. Given the serious implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, further investigations into 284 this period in China needs to be carried out. 285 Readers are reminded of the assumptions that underlie our estimates, and they should 286 therefore be taken as approximate. However, even if there were non-negligible reporting errors 287 in these new data, the magnitude of the discrepancy between the results from their analysis and 288 China's official figures suggests that the potential impact on the global efforts to control the 289 pandemic is obvious. Transparency in China is of critical importance for the world to learn from 290 this infection and for those in the future.",
