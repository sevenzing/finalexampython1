Activated (phosphorylated) c-Abl has been found in a high level in postmortem studies of patients with PD [193, 194] . It was also reported that activation of c-Abl in mice induces neurodegeneration in the hippocampal and striatal brain areas [195] . Continuous work has demonstrated that c-Abl phosphorylation occurs as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress [196] , which can promote the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein in through effects on autophagy mechanisms [195] and can further promote phosphorylation of parkin, causing inhibition of its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal death [194] . All the above evidences propose that c-Abl may be a promising therapeutic target in the management of PD.

More importantly, these effects were seen at doses far lower (1-10 mg/kg/day) than those used to treat CML, which is considered as the key characteristics for potential drug repurposing. Furthermore, nilotinib prevented dopaminergic cell loss and motor impairments induced by MPTP in mice, which were associated with inhibition of parkin phosphorylation and reduced accumulation of parkin substrate PARIS, thus hinting at another potential mechanism of action [197, 198] . Based on these preclinical data, a small, open-label proof-of-concept study was recently conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nilotinib in 12 patients with PD dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies followed-up for 24 weeks, followed by a final assessment 12 weeks later [199] . The necessary lowest choice of dose for the clinical study was taken as 150-300 mg. The authors reported that nilotinib was well tolerated, though one patient receiving 300 mg was diagnosed with myocardial infarction, and two had transient QTc prolongations. There was also evidence of CNS penetration with nilotinib CSF plasma ratio of 12 and 15% with 300 and 150 mg, respectively. Due to numerous methodological limitations, these findings should be interpreted with caution [200] . Due to unwanted off-target nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibition; side effects of nilotinib at doses used to treat CML include cardiac conduction abnormalities. Therefore, claims of tolerability should be interpreted with caution. Indeed, the effects on efficacy was also highly impossible to be concluded. Besides, it was also reported in the CSF, none of the markers used were validated as biomarkers in PD; they can also vary greatly between patients and track poorly with disease stage and progression.

The drugs listed above are only a few of plenty drugs that can be repurposed in various therapies. The drugs discussed in the perspective are summarized in Table 1 and compared to the previous uses of each drug with the repurposed use. The opportunities for drug repurposing are diverse, but a lot still has to be done for its exploration. Drug repurposing or drug repositioning offers a new strategy to academic centers, research council programs, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for drug development. The main advantage of drug repurposing is the established safety of the known candidate compounds when compared to that of the development of novel therapeutic compounds. The time and cost required to advance a candidate into clinical trials can be substantially reduced because in vitro and in vivo screening, chemical optimization, toxicity studies, bulk manufacturing, and formulation development have already been completed in many cases, and can, therefore, be bypassed. Moreover, these drugs have been on the market for many years, and consequently, the side effects are already known, and safety is therefore very high. For medicinal chemists, the repurposing of drugs on cancer is a rewarding job for the global healthcare system and possibly a step forward for people to get cheaper and safer medicines rather than afford for cancer therapy.

The drug came into use in the year 1988 in the US. The anticancer activity of drug 27 has been reported in several cancer types including hepatoma, colon, and fibrosarcoma, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. In rat models of fibrosarcoma and hepatoma, the drug 27 significantly reduced the growth rate and the level of vascularization [66]. The drug 27 was found to have an anti-proliferative effect on human colon cancer cell lines [67]. The tumor inhibitory activity of drug 27 was also proved in ovarian cancer [68]. At the molecular level, diclofenac induces apoptosis through inhibition of antioxidant superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD 2), leading to increased levels of reactive oxygen species [69]. Recent Phase II clinical trial study of diclofenac for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma concluded that topical application of diclofenac was highly effective in tumor regression with 64% [70, 71]. Naproxen (28) is a member of the propionic acid family of NSAID class, which has been used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and fever. This drug works by non-selectively inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which results in inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. In 1976, the drug was marketed in the USA for its medical use. Recently the drug 28 has been repurposed for its anticancer activity as it was shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and suppress metastasis in various cancer cell types. In vitro studies of drug 28 in human urinary bladder cancer cell lines showed that it induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis through targeting PI3K [72].

However, relatively high doses of statins are required to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, increasing the risk of myopathy, the most common adverse efect associated with statins. This makes it desirable to identify drugs which reduce the dose of pitavastatin necessary to treat cancer. A drug-repositioning strategy was employed to identify suitable candidates. Screening a custom library of 100 of-patent drugs for synergistic activity with pitavastatin identifed prednisolone (35) as the most prominent hit. Prednisolone potentiated the activity of pitavastatin in several assays measuring the growth, survival or apoptosis in several ovarian cancer cells lines. Prednisolone, alone or in some cases in combination with pitavastatin, reduced the expression of genes encoding enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, providing a mechanistic explanation for the synergy pitavastatin inhibited the growth of tested cell lines with an IC 50 ranging from 1.1 to 4.8 \u00b5M. Therefore, clinical trials of prednisolone with pitavastatin in patients with ovarian cancer may be highly warranted. In case of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and several other cancers, Wnt signaling is overactivated and hence, its suppression emerges as an effective anticancer treatment. However, no drugs targeting the Wnt pathway exist on the market nor in advanced clinical trials. Very recently, Ahmed et al have provided a comprehensive body of preclinical evidence that an anti-leprotic drug clofazimine (36) is effective against TNBC [85]. Clofazimine specifically inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in a panel of TNBC cells in vitro. For example, an IC 50 of 6 \u03bcM and 7 \u03bcM was exhibited in HEK293T and BT-20 cells respectively. In several mouse xenograft models of TNBC, clofazimine efficiently suppresses tumor growth, correlating with in vivo inhibition of the Wnt pathway in the tumors. Clofazimine is well compatible with doxorubicin, exerting additive effects on tumor growth suppression, producing no adverse effects. Its excellent and well-characterized pharmacokinetics profile, lack of serious adverse effects at moderate (yet therapeutically effective) doses, its combinability with cytotoxic therapeutics, and the novel mechanistic mode of action make clofazimine a prime candidate for the repositioning clinical trials. Our work may bring forward the anti-Wnt targeted therapy, desperately needed for thousands of patients currently lacking targeted treatments. Multiple myeloma (MM, also known as plasma cell myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells) is an incurable hematological malignancy driven by several genetic and epigenetic alterations. This MM is associated with a variety of genetic and epigenetic events (namely aberrant DNA methylation, histone modifications including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation and phosphorylation, actin, and non-coding RNA expression) as well as deregulation of various signaling pathways that regulate DNA repair, RNA editing, protein homeostasis. These epigenetic events have been associated with abnormal signaling by dysregulation of critical pathways controlling cell cycle, apoptosis and drug resistance. Catalano, Raffaella, et al. recently reported anti-tumor activity of hydroxychloroquine (37), derivative of chloroquine and an anti-malarial agent also known as autophagy inhibitor).

Severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an atypical form of pneumonia, which is caused by a human coronavirus (CoV) called SARS-CoV. The major outbreak was happened in 2003, and it affected more than 800 cases across three continents with a mortality rate of about 10% [91-94]. In 2012, a novel human coronavirus called Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered, which was associated with severe respiratory tract infection, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy.

Drug re-purposing has gained significance attention among scientists and pharmaceutical companies involved in the identification of new therapeutic uses / indications for discontinued during the clinical development phase because of efficacy or commercial reasons. Recently, this approach hasaccounted for ~30% of all newly approved drugs by the FDA. This emeans the success rate of drug approval is so high when compared to the traditional methods[202]. During the year 2012 to 2017[203], almost 170 re-purposed drugs entered the drug development pipeline.Currently, these 170 drugs are at different stages of development. Around 72% are in Phase II clinical development, 7% are in proof of concept clinical studies, 8% are in pre-clinical stages, and regulatory bodies have approved 3% in research and development and 10%. Almost 70% of the Phase I and II trials for re-purposed drugs were sponsored by academia and 30% by industry. Besides, drug-repositioning approach increases the fruitful collaborations and funding opportunities. During the year 2012 to 2017, there were almost 40 collaborations relating to drug repurposing. Among these, around 50% of collaborations were between two industries mainly focused on rare diseases. Almost, 20% between an industry and a Non-profit Organization (NPO) and 9% between industry and academia. Regarding funding opportunities, there was a substantial increase in funds (US$1 million to US$100 million) for drug repurposing projects by various funding agencies like National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), Cures within Reach (CWR, an NPO), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Findacure.Investigational New Chemical Entities (NCEs) that failed to show efficacy / potency and lack of safety for a pre-intended indication typically provides a good start for their revival against new indications by repurposing. This can be very much useful in cases of rare diseases such as autoimmune disorders, bacterial infections, neglected diseases and rare cancers such as pediatric cancers where unmet medical need owing to non-availability of standard therapies, worsening clinical outcomes and more difficult to treat. Unlike NCEs, all re-purposed molecules possess all required safety, preclinical and efficacy data enables the investigator to make an informed decision at much earlier stage of drug development substantially reduces the costs, time and efforts required for successfully bringing a repositioned drug to the market. Drug repositioning also offers significant potential for out-licensing as well, because of availability of potential buyers. Drug re-purposing also provides an opportunity to broaden our knowledge without limiting the existing information.On the other hand, this approach has some limitations due to lack of a clear exclusivity path / well-defined regulatory guidelines. It is still a big hurdle / uphill task in utilizing repurposed drug candidates for human use. In general, a repurposing candidate carries a potential time risk because it has failed previously for a pre-intended indication. Hence, it is advisable to design a branched development program, in which the lead compound is evaluated for several indications simultaneously. Drug repurposing requires thorough comprehension of biological and molecular pathways that a drug can modulate as well as its interactions with endogenous bio-molecules in order for a successful repurposing of that drug molecule. When repurposing a drug for rare and neglected diseases, there is no assurance that the economic returns will be substantial as expected for a pharmaceutical company.
