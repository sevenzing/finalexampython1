Some patients develop other symptoms like diarrhea. However, it is possible for other organs to be affected including the central nervous system, liver, and blood cells. e purpose of this case series is to unravel other factors associated with this disease, so we report three cases of COVID-19 that were hospitalized during the pandemic.",

It is a virus with a high mutation rate and a genome-encoded exonuclease which causes the zoonotic viral pathogen to modify and potentially become more virulent [3] . Six identified species of coronavirus infect humans. Four of them (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) cause common cold symptoms while the other two (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) are zoonotic beta coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory distress [1, 2, 4, 5] . SARS-CoV-2 is more like the zoonotic types in terms of severity and the organ involved, and all three of them have origins in bats [1, 2, 4, 5] . e genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows the most similarities with SARS-CoV and SARS-like bat CoV [6] . ey both bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor in human host cells [6] . Several of the first cases of pneumonia of unknown causes in Wuhan, China, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, which was closed as a result [1, 3] . COVID-19 was added to the Notifiable Communicable Disease list, and public health measures are in place to lessen the spread of the virus [3] . More than 50% of affected patients were males [7] . e total number of cases in the United States until May 8, 2020, is over 1.2 million and total death of more than 73,000 with an expected increase in new cases and mortality [5] . e exact method of transmission is unknown, but it has been labeled as an airborne virus [1] . Person-to-person transmission via droplets from coughing or sneezing or direct contact has been reported [3, 4, 8] . Respiratory droplets and direct contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces have also been postulated [7, 9] . Since SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in urine, saliva, and the gastrointestinal tract, other forms of transmission are still under investigation [7, 10] . e Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended droplet, contact, and airborne precautions along with protection of the eyes for confirmed cases [10] . Tropism for nonrespiratory mucosa as seen in the eyelids has also been documented [9] .",

Worse outcomes are seen in patients who present with respiratory distress on admission [7] . Being a novel virus, there are no specific drugs against it. Empiric antibiotics along with oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, and oxygen support have been tried [1, 7] . Other medications tried are moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, nemonoxacin, linezolid, umifenovir, azithromycin and amoxicillin, cefepime, vancomycin, and intravenous remdesivir (developed against Ebola) [8, 10, 12] . A controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir is in place for COVID-19, since there are no specific antivirals with proven effectiveness against the virus in humans [3] . Chloroquine decreased hospital stays and lessened the extent of pneumonia spread in patients with the disease [13] . Hydroxychloroquine has also been used, and it has a similar mechanism of action to chloroquine [13] . Remdesivir has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treating severe COVID-19 [12] . Other newer and experimental drugs are expected to be developed soon.",
