However, it is still a critical period for the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia outbreak. The burn department, as an emergency department, is facing serious risks. In order to improve the patient treatment rate, avoid medical staff infection or reduce the risk of infection, according to the characteristics of the new coronavirus pneumonia, our own experience, the latest release of the diagnosis and treatment program of China and the relevant recommendations of national prevention and control, combined with the latest literature at home and abroad and hospital management experience of related departments, etc., our institute, one of the biggest burn centers in the world, raised some advices on the medical practice in burn department during the new coronavirus pneumonia pandemic, hoping to provide useful information to medical staff in burn department and hospital managers.",

Small area burn injury is suggested to be treated at home. First aid knowledge about small area burns should be spread to residents. After the burn injury, the management of wound area should follow the protocol of flushing, taking of clothes, soaking, disinfection, bandage or exposure. Long-term flushing with cold water immediately after the burn injury is stressed. The duration of flushing should be over 30 minutes, optimal 2-4 hours. If no pain is felt after moving away from the cold water for 2-5 minutes, it indicates sufficient flushing. After enough time for cold treatment, iodophor can be used to disinfect wound area, followed by external use antibacterial drugs, such as Mupirocin Ointment, and bandage.",
