            "text": "In some critically ill children, a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) appears to develop in response to the virus. This syndrome is characterized by an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 resulting in clinical symptoms of high fevers, rashes, coagulopathy, and neurologic changes, with some progressing to multiple organ failure and death [15] . Lab abnormalities frequently associated with CSS include thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevations of the following: transaminase levels, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), coagulation times, CRP, and ferritin (ferritin is often profoundly elevated). This syndrome is very similar to macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which is commonly encountered and treated by rheumatologists. Treatments that have proven effective for treatment of MAS include corticosteroids, anakinra and tocilizumab among others [16] . Early reports, mainly from China, described adult patients that fit the description of COVID-19 associated CSS, and had successful J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f outcomes after treatment with tocilizumab [17] . For this reason, many across the US have proposed this medication be used if evidence of CSS exists. Many rheumatologists, including our group, would propose using anakinra (IV is suggested specifically as subcutaneous dosing was not found to be as effective in one study) if children have evidence of CSS or are severely ill with multiorgan failure [18] . Anakinra has a quick onset, short half-life (4 hours), large therapeutic window, and a good safety profile. We find this a favorable treatment option; if there is not a quick and adequate response an alternate medication can be considered.",

If the presentation is most consistent with KD and there is failureof first line treatment a second dose of IVIG or infliximab (a Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor) could be considered. For critically ill children, decisions regarding thrombosis prophylaxis should be guided by hematology. Some patients have presented with severe inflammation with or without KD features consistent with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) (see Rheumatology section for a more detailed description). For these patients we would consider use of anakinra and corticosteroids, in particular if they are not responding to supportive care or first line treatments [8].
