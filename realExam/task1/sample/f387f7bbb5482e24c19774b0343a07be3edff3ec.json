Although most people exposed to the virus go on to develop full-blown disease at variable intervals, a proportion of them, labeled as long-term nonprogressors or exposed uninfected, possess 'natural resistance' to infection. A better understanding of genetic and immunologic basis of such a natural resistance to infection would bear important implications in designing therapeutic vaccine designs. The genetic variants that could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 and limit AIDS vary in different populations and among individuals. Meta-analyses of large cohort studies have identified numerous 'AIDS restriction genes' that regulate HIV cell entry (particularly chemokine coreceptors and their ligands), acquired and innate immunity (major histocompatibility complex, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, and cytokines), and others [tripartite interaction motif 5 a (TRIM5a) and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G] that influence outcome of HIV infection. Studies carried out in the Indian population with regard to genetic polymorphisms in chemokine receptors have shown that (i) the protective CCR5 D32 variant is rare, (ii) CCR5HHE carrying *59402A is associated with increased likelihood of infection and development of AIDS, and (iii) the Indian population generally has low CCL3L1 copy numbers ($2.3).

Lack of suitable animal model systems, inherent hypervariability of the virus, and its extraordinary ability to adapt and evolve in the host are some of the major hurdles responsible for the delay in developing vaccine against HIV ( Table 2) . The virus has devised its own mechanisms to escape immune recognition and surveillance through extensive glycosylation and surface masking. For example, the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 possess immunogenic epitopes, but most of these are not exposed on the virus surface and therefore not available for an effector immune response. Likewise, the gp120 CD4-binding site is a recessed cavity in the virus and therefore inaccessible for the antibodies. Importantly, virus infection results in downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression and effectively perturbs antigen presentation. Likewise, antibodies to gp120 CD4-binding site have been reported to hinder antigen presentation and suppress gp120-specific CD4 T-cell responses (1) . The CD4 T cells decline in number, and their response is compromised in HIV-1-infected patients, although antigen stimulation can induce chemokine secretion and suppress HIV infection in vitro (2) . HIV-1-infected T cells form a virological synapse with noninfected CD41 T cells to efficiently transfer HIV-1 virions from cell to cell. The viral gp120 participates in the formation of a virological synapse (3) , plausibly leading to dysregulated T-cell activation, which is in analogy with the immunological synapse that normally results in regulated T-cell activation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1178, "end": 1181, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1380, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1594, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 416, "text": "Table 2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Host genetic factors are important determinants that influence susceptibility to virus infection and subsequent progression to AIDS.

Individuals are not equally susceptible to infection and have differences in their viral set points, rates of decline of CD4 T cells, levels of viremia, emergence of CTL escape mutants, and development of opportunistic infections resulting in varying incubation periods of the AIDS virus. While a majority of individuals infected with HIV-1 progress to AIDS, if untreated (called as 'progressors'), most of them can, however, be turned 'aviremic' by antiretroviral therapy (Figure 1 ). More importantly, $5%-10% of infected individuals do not develop AIDS for more than 7 years, remain naturally aviremic, and are referred to as LTNPs.

The progressors, on the other hand, permit virus propagation to >10,000 RNA copies per milliliter, but once on antiretroviral therapy (ART), their viral loads can be suppressed to undetectable levels. An international collaborative HIV controller consortium has recently been established with the purpose of recruiting elite controllers from different ethnic groups (7) .
