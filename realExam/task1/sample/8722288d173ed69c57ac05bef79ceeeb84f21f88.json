A recent animal challenge study 69 showed evidence of (at least) short-term protection against re-infections in rhesus macaques 70 experimentally re-infected 4 weeks after first infection [5] . Typically, infections by different 71 viruses trigger different adaptive immune responses: viruses like measles elicit life-long 72 immunity; whereas others, like influenza, do not. Two main processes appear to be responsible 73 for the short-lived immunity engendered against some pathogens: 1) waning of antibodies and 74 memory cells in the host system; and 2) antigenic drift of the pathogen that enables escape from 75 the immunity built against previous strains. 76",
