In all these cases, howe ve r, the peritoneal and pleural changes are accompanied by substantial hepatic parenchymal lesions, unlike in the present case. More recently, a condition almost identical to the present case has been reported in two separate situations w h e re IFN-\u03b3 deficient gene knockout mice we re exposed to M H V. In the first, a granulomatous pleuro-peritonitis deve loped following natural exposure in IFN-\u03b3/interleukin 10 double knockout mice, although interestingly IFN-\u03b3 s i n g l e knockout mice were not affected. 21 In the second report, IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice developed ascites, peritonitis and pleuritis with granulomatous inflammation following experimental inoculation of MHV by the intraperitoneal route. 22 While the findings of these two re p o rts suggest that pleuroperitonitis can be t h e major lesion induced by MHV in animals deficient in IFN-\u03b3, other studies show that this is not always the case.

Route of inoculation can also influence disease manifestation, although this does not seem to be important in establishing peritonitis since natural exposure and intraperitoneal ro u t e s both led to a similar distribution of lesions.
