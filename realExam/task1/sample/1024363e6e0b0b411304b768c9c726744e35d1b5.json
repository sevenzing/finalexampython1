Clinically, these infections result in a broad range of outcomes from inapparent, economically insignificant effects to those that are severe and economically devastating. The outcome of these infections is determined by a variety of interacting factors not least of which are age and immune status of affected birds, and virulence of the involved virus(es). In field situations, these infections almost always are complicated by other infectious agents as well as management, nutrition and environmental factors, thus the true role of these agents in naturally occurring gastrointestinal diseases often is difficult to assess.",

However, characterization of these viruses and the determination of their importance in these diseases has been a monumental task as most of these viruses are difficult or seemingly impossible to cultivate using conventional in vitro procedures. Further progress in understanding these viruses and their role in gastrointestinal disease of poultry undoubtedly will be aided by future improvements in in vitro cell culture techniques, and increased application of modern diagnostic procedures such as virus-specific monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction procedures.",

These infections are known to negatively impact production, and the effects of these diseases likely continue long after clinical recovery. Mortality in many cases may be an important cause of economic loss, but more typically, losses result from depressed average daily gains, impaired feed efficiency, and decreased flock uniformity (Barnes, 1997) . In addition, virus infections of the gastrointestinal tract likely are responsible for the development of a number of other, extragastrointestinal diseases. Virus-induced mucosal damage may provide a portal of entry for other potential pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.; such damage also may promote gastrointestinal attachment of potential pathogens as a result of loss of normal defense mechanisms (i.e., glycocalyx, mucin, microvilli). Malabsorption and mal-digestion that occur consequent to virus-induced mucosal damage may result in nutritional deficiencies, especially those related to fat-soluble vitamins and minerals. Rickets, osteoporosis, and other skeletal abnormalities frequently are seen in young, meat-type birds that experience gastrointestinal disease. Nutritional deficiency that occurs as a result of these infections also may cause impaired growth and development of lymphoid organs, particularly the bursa of Fabricius and thymus. This lymphoid organ damage may result in immunological deficiency and increased susceptibility to other infectious diseases.",

The genome is comprised of 11 linear segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA with a total molecular weight of approximately 12 \u00d7 10 6 . Each RNA segment consists of an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a single protein. Replication and assembly of rotaviruses occurs in the cytoplasm with virus particles often found within vacuoles.

Based on studies with mammalian rotaviruses (Moon, 1978) , diarrhea most likely occurs due to destruction of mature villous enterocytes and replacement by immature epithelium from crypts. Immature, undifferentiated cells that replace cells destroyed by the virus lack disaccharidases and have impaired absorptive ability. Diarrhea likely results from effects of both malabsorption and maldigestion (Moon, 1978) .

            "text": "Poult Enteritis and Mortality Syndrome, otherwise referred to as \"Spiking Mortality of Turkeys\", is a recently identified disease of young turkeys of unknown etiology . The PEMS disease is a transmissible, infectious disease that generally affects turkeys between the ages of 7 to 28 d. Birds affected with PEMS exhibit depression, diarrhea, anorexia, growth depression, and increased mortality; total mortality in severely affected flocks may be as high as 50%. Birds examined at necropsy have pale, thin-walled and distended intestines, thymic atrophy, and bursal atrophy. Microscopic lesions in affected birds generally include moderate to marked lymphoid depletion in spleen, bursa of Fabricius, and thymus. Flocks that have recovered from PEMS generally exhibit stunting, lack of size uniformity, increased susceptibility to other diseases, increased time-to-market, and increased feed conversion. The PEMS disease presently is believed to be localized to North Carolina and surrounding states; however, unconfirmed cases have been cited in Indiana and New York.",

Experimental attempts to reproduce this disease with single infectious agents have been uniformly unsuccessful.",
