These primary cases are of particular interest for understanding the source(s) and route(s) of transmission and for designing long-term disease control measures. Dromedary camels are the only animal species for which there is convincing evidence that it is a host species for MERS-CoV and hence a potential source of human infections. However, only a small proportion of the primary cases have reported contact with camels. Other possible sources and vehicles of infection include food-borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk and raw meat, medicinal use of camel urine and zoonotic transmission from other species. There are critical knowledge gaps around this new disease which can only be closed through traditional field epidemiological investigations and studies designed to test hypothesis regarding sources of infection and risk factors for disease. Since the 1960s, there has been a radical change in dromedary camel farming practices in the Arabian Peninsula with an intensification of the production and a concentration of the production around cities. It is possible that the recent intensification of camel herding in the Arabian Peninsula has increased the virus' reproductive number and attack rate in camel herds while the 'urbanization' of camel herding increased the frequency of zoonotic 'spillover' infections from camels to humans. It is reasonable to assume, although difficult to measure, that the sensitivity of public health surveillance to detect previously unknown diseases is lower in East Africa than in Saudi Arabia and that sporadic human cases may have gone undetected there.",

One study in Saudi Arabia reported that 42% of the MERS-CoV cases had contact with camels, but the number of cases included in the study was limited (n = 12) . A review by the MERS-CoV World Health Organization Research Group revealed that among 51 investigated primary cases, 55% (n = 28) reported contacts with animals but just 10% (n = 5) reported contacts with dromedary camels (The World Health Organization Mers-Cov Research Group, 2013). Among 517 primary cases in the ECDC line listing, only 23 reported to have had animal contacts: 12 had direct contact with dromedary camels; 10 visited a farm (unspecified type); and 11 had unspecified contact with animals (the list is not mutually exclusive). All but one case were male with a mean age of 56 years (range 25-82). In addition, five primary cases reported drinking dromedary camel milk. None reported eating dromedary camel meat or drinking dromedary camel urine. The age and gender distribution among primary cases is skewed towards older men, while the distribution among secondary cases is balanced. From what we have been able to establish, the gender distribution among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appears to be balanced, and the same can be assumed for household contacts of primary cases. Therefore, the imbalance among primary cases is most likely the result of differentiated exposure rather than a biological gender difference in susceptibility. It is plausible that exposure to the source of infection differs between the sexes and across age groups. Because camel rearing is an exclusively male activity that is also popular among middle-aged and retired men, this social activity could help explain the gender difference and age-distribution among primary cases. Both greater susceptibility to infection and higher severity among people who have underlying medical conditions (comorbidities) could help explain the higher incidence among older age groups.",

It is possible that animal workers develop functional immunity as a result of repetitive contacts with infected camels and therefore are at lower risk of developing severe illness. A matched case-control study looking at seroconversion rate in animal workers compared to the general population would provide valuable information.",

Antibodies against MERS-CoV have been detected also in dromedary camels in Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, south Sudan, Tunisia and the Canary Islands Reusken et al., 2013b; Corman et al., 2014) . Retrospective analysis indicates that MERS-CoV was circulating in dromedary camels as early as 1992 in Saudi Arabia (Alagaili et al., 2014) and 2003 in the United Arab Emirates . The most recent MERS-CoV ancestor was sampled from humans in 2011 (Rambaut, 2013) . MERS-CoV gene fragments have been detected in nasal swabs taken from dromedary camels in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014 ; World Health Organisation for Animal Health, 2014), in few instances in camel faeces samples in Saudi Arabia and Qatar (Alagaili et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2014) and in camel milk in Qatar . MERS-CoV is likely to be an acute infection in camels, and there is no evidence for prolonged viral shedding beyond a few weeks. Where full genome MERS-CoV sequences from dromedaries are available, they are highly homologous to MERS-CoV sequences recovered from human isolates. This indicates that the same viruses can infect both camels and humans (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014) .",

After the weaning period in the spring, the mare is milked for human consumption. If there is seasonality in the incidence among camels with a peak in the spring explained by the new birth cohort of susceptible calves, and if there is only partial immunity to MERS-CoV among adult camels, then one would expect to see a peak in cases both among young camels and among adults. Should the virus be excreted in the milk, such a scenario could potentially lead to an increase in contamination rate of the milk during spring and consequently an increase in number of primary human cases.",

Considering that milking is predominantly performed manually and potentially without proper pre-cleaning of the teats, diarrhoeal outbreaks in calves could facilitate the introduction of virus into the milk production, either via direct contact between infected faeces and the udder or via the hands of the camel milkers. Potentially, calves can also contaminate the udder through sucking and deposit of infected saliva.",

The critical next step is to confirm and eventually control the animal source of human infections. It is remarkable that, 2 years after the onset of this outbreak, there are still important gaps in the descriptive epidemiology of the disease. It is crucial to conduct the field epidemiology investigations that can disentangle the risk factors for infection and confirm the source of infection and the routes of transmission from the animal source to humans. A first step could be to re-interview and reclassify all surviving case patients and the relatives of the fatal cases. This would be a time-consuming exercise, but we believe it could generate important new hypotheses and insights that could help control this outbreak. Further microbiological experiments on milk, meat and urine should urgently be conducted to establish whether they are (effective) vehicles for virus transmission.",
