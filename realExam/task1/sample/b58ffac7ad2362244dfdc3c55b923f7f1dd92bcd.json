One asymptomatic patient had evidence of consolidation on chest CT Abstract: Background: COVID-19 (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]) has rapidly spread in mainland China and into multiple countries worldwide. The radiographic profile of this infection continues to evolve as more cases present beyond the epicenter of Wuhan, China. Purpose: We present 21 COVID-19 cases from two Chinese centers with CT and chest radiograph (CXR) findings, as well as follow-up imaging in 5 cases. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Patients with COVID-19 infection were included. A systematic review of the published literature on COVID-19 infection's radiological features. Results: The predominant imaging pattern is of ground-glass opacification with occasional consolidation in the peripheries. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy were absent in all cases. Patients demonstrate evolution of the ground-glass opacities into consolidation, and subsequent resolution of the airspaces changes. Ground-glass and consolidative opacities visible on CT are sometimes undetectable on chest radiographs, suggesting that CT is a more sensitive imaging modality for investigation. The systematic review identified 4 other studies confirming the findings of bilateral and peripheral ground glass with or without consolidation as the predominant finding on CT chest examinations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 infection pulmonary manifestation is predominantly characterized by ground-glass opacification with occasional consolidation on CT.
