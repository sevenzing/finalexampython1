In addition to these, contributing to continuing medical education activities remains another important role. GETUP has continued to enroll registrants in our free introductory clinical toxicology training program (www.acmt.net/GETUP). We have drawn participants from diverse professional backgrounds and geographic locations. From the start of the pandemic in December 2019 to the end of April 2020, there have been 60 registrants in 15 countries for the course. Participants include scientists, pharmacists, poison information specialists, medical students, residents, and physicians. For example, medical staff with toxicology placements in Oman and Qatar have used it during this time. We have provided GETUP training to poison centers in Ethiopia and Myanmar as part of International Health Regulations (IHR) strengthening initiatives led by Public Health England in conjunction with the UK National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) [5] . This will prove invaluable at supplementing training delivered by experts directly in country prior to the pandemic.",
