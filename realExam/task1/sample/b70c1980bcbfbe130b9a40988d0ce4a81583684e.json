Until recent years, however, researchers seeking to gain a mechanistic understanding of the nature and relative importance of this association have had a limited number of tools to diagnose viral infections and investigate relationships to acute and chronic effects on asthma. In this article we will discuss how recent advances in research approaches and technology have helped to define associations between viral respiratory tract illnesses and the development of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma, as well as asthma exacerbations in children and adults. In addition, we will identify important gaps in our current knowledge and reflect on potential directions for future research into understanding the role of viral respiratory tract infections in asthmatic subjects.",

For example, in the past, respiratory tract viruses were difficult to detect by using conventional methods because some do not grow well in culture. In clinical studies of acute viral illnesses, detection rates of 30% to 50% were the norm with techniques such as viral culture, antigen detection with labeled antibodies, or serologic detection. More recently, molecular techniques have greatly improved overall rates of viral detection (Table I) , and some studies of acute respiratory tract illnesses have reported viral detection rates of as high as 90%, especially in infants. These techniques have been used to identify whole new classes of viruses, such as metapneumoviruses, bocaviruses, new strains of coronaviruses (NL63, SARS, and HKU1), and polyomaviruses. Each of these viruses can cause acute wheezing in infancy, and some have also been associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.",

It seems likely that HRV-C has been circulating for some time rather than being a newly emergent virus. Recent data in studies of children suggest that viruses in the HRV-C group might be either more prone to stimulate acute symptoms of asthma or intrinsically more virulent. 5 One common feature of HRV-C and other newly identified viruses is that most are difficult or impossible to grow in standard tissue culture, which explains why they were detected first with molecular techniques.",

This is particularly true for HRV, which can be found in a considerable proportion of healthy subjects, especially in the spring and fall. Studies using sequential sampling in children indicate that detection of HRV in well children represents asymptomatic infection. Therefore it has been important to link symptomatic illnesses, particularly wheezing illnesses, with HRV detection when estimating its role in determining asthma risk. 6, 7 Chronic infection with HRV does not occur except in association with marked immunosuppression. 8 Identification of biomarkers that would allow us to better connect viral detection with clinically relevant outcomes is an important research goal, which would improve our ability to interpret epidemiologic data. The use of viral sequencing to track individual strains in clinical studies and the development of new techniques to track the anatomic distribution of viruses in vivo could aid the understanding of this issue.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent infection causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children 1 year of age and younger and commonly presents as a wheezing illness during the late fall, winter, and early spring in temperate climates. 10 Recently, Wu et al 11 reported that the timing of infant birth in relationship to the peak of bronchiolitis hospitalizations for that winter season predicted the likelihood of clinically significant bronchiolitis. In addition, children who were about 121 days old at the winter virus peak also had the greatest risk of asthma. Similarly, seasonal epidemiologic analysis has been used to demonstrate that infantile wheezing illnesses during HRV seasons are important predictors of the development of persistent wheezing and asthma later in childhood. 7, 12 These studies suggest the possibility that respiratory tract viral infections in early childhood contribute to asthma causality.",

The apparent disparities between these informative, high-quality studies with regard to the direction of causation between severe RSV infections and asthma suggest that resolving this controversy might require prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional studies, such as use of prophylactic RSV-specific mAb therapy.",

It is important to understand how host factors modify relationships between earlylife viral respiratory tract infections and the development of wheezing illnesses and childhood asthma. Identifying risk factors that determine which infants and young children are most likely to wheeze with infections and the role of these infections in the genesis of asthma has been the focus of intense investigation. In this regard the relative importance of (1) lower lung volumes at birth, especially in those born prematurely; (2) the atopic status of infants; (3) the intensity of mucus secretion in response to infection; (4) neurotrophic pathways critical to airway hyperresponsiveness provoked by infection 15 ; and (5) the ability of infants who wheeze to generate immune responses to viral pathogens, including the production of IFN-g and type I and III interferons, remain important areas of research. Overall, it will be important to identify host genetic factors that influence the developing pulmonary and immune systems because maturational delays in host airways and antiviral responses could increase the risk of virus-induced wheeze and childhood asthma; that is, differences in the maturational level of airways and the immune system could render some infants and children more susceptible to the development of respiratory tract virus-initiated, persistent airway sequelae. Alternatively, it is possible that virus-induced wheezing episodes might be a marker for subjects predisposed to asthma because of delays in airway and immune system development.",

Accordingly, recent studies in murine models have shown that different isolates of RSV can vary significantly with regard to their virulence and mucogenicity. 20 If this is the case for HRV, targeting vaccination to a few HRV strains could possibly help prevent exacerbations or even prevent the development of asthma.

In fact, there is recent evidence that the establishment of intestinal flora in infants contributes to immune development and that this process might influence the development of allergic diseases and perhaps the quality of antiviral responses. 24 Studies of microbial flora in the gut, skin, and respiratory tract should provide new insights into these relationships and perhaps provide another strategy for prevention of allergic diseases and asthma. 23 ",

Currently, there are no approved vaccines for RSV or HRV that could be used in such a study. However, the results of 2 nonrandomized studies of passive immunization to RSV in early life suggest that preventing severe RSV infection in infancy with mAbs might reduce subsequent asthma. 25, 26 However, randomized and placebo-controlled study designs are needed to definitively answer this question. Similar studies with other respiratory tract viruses, such as HRV, await the development of safe and effective antivirals or vaccines. The high rates of exposure to these viruses early in life and the relative immaturity of the neonatal immune system will make effective vaccination difficult and will require the development of novel vaccination strategies or technology. 27 Safe antiviral agents might eventually become as important as antibiotics in changing the microbiological landscape and associated respiratory morbidity. A variety of novel therapeutics, including inhibitors of attachment to host cells, viral protease inhibitors, and inhibitors of viral replication, are at various stages of development. 27 However, there have been several challenges to this approach because the time between the onset of cold symptoms and deterioration of lung function can be short, and the development of viral resistance must be considered. For specific antiviral therapies to be implemented in clinical practice, it also might be necessary to develop accurate, affordable, and rapid viral diagnostics. Viral diagnostics might not be needed during periods in which one virus is especially prevalent (eg, fall HRV infections), when a specific viral syndrome is readily recognizable (eg, influenza-like illness in January), or if broad-spectrum antiviral agents can be developed.",

The mechanism for this reduction in risk is not known, and further exploration might lead to new treatments to prevent exacerbations. Examples of possible mechanisms include reduction in the number of inflammatory cells that could amplify responses to viral infection, regeneration of the airway epithelial barrier after removal of chronic epithelial damage caused by products of allergic inflammation, and restoration of normal epithelial innate immunity after alteration by allergic inflammatory mediators.",

Also, macrolides deserve more attention as possible antiinflammatory agents targeting exacerbations. Although pharmacogenetics is expected to offer personalized solutions in the future, there are currently many attempts to characterize asthma phenotypes in a clinical sense by using, among other criteria, virus-induced exacerbations as a key component. Consequently, it is possible that interventions should be tailored to specific phenotypes. Notably, recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that neither high-dose inhaled nor oral corticosteroids are suitable for virus-induced wheezing in infancy. 29, 30 It is possible that asthma controllers could be of benefit to specific subsets of infants. 31, 32 Study designs evaluating individual responses to controller medications can highlight differential treatment responses. 33 Among other issues, continuous versus on-demand pharmacotherapy for exacerbations should be re-evaluated for different asthma phenotypes. Recent efforts to perform comprehensive studies investigating immunologic, virologic, and physiologic measures in the lower airways of asthmatic subjects during viral infections will help to inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. 34 Strategies aiming at reduction of respiratory tract virus exposure achievable by simple means, such as hand washing, can have a significant effect on morbidity, further suggesting the need for including focused educational programs as part of exacerbation management.",
