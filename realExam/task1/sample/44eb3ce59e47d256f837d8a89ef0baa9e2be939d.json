            "text": "Long-term administration of phenobarbital has been reported to cause hepatic injury in dogs. Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzymes, and it may be difficult to distinguish the effect of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activities from actual hepatic damage. The hepatotoxicity of phenobarbital and the impact of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activity were investigated prospectively in 12 normal dogs. Phenobarbital was administered for 29 weeks at 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (range, 4.8-6.6 mg/kg) PO q12h, resulting in therapeutic serum phenobarbital concentrations (20-40 g/mL). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), \u2425-glutamyltransferase (GGT), fasted bile acids (fBA), total bilirubin, and albumin were determined before and during treatment. Lateral abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasounds, and histopathologic examinations of liver tissue obtained by ultrasound-guided biopsy were performed before and during treatment. Radiographs revealed a moderate increase in liver size in most dogs. Ultrasonographic examination revealed no change in liver echogenicity or architecture. No evidence of morphologic liver damage was observed histopathologically. ALP and ALT increased significantly (P \u03fd .05), GGT increased transiently, and albumin decreased transiently during the study. There were no significant changes in AST, bilirubin, and fBA. These results suggest that increases in serum ALP, ALT, and GGT may reflect enzyme induction rather than hepatic injury during phenobarbital treatment in dogs. Serum AST, fBA, and bilirubin, and ultrasonographic evaluation of the liver are not affected by the enzyme-inducing effect of phenobarbital and can therefore be helpful to assess liver disease in dogs treated with the drug.",

            "text": "P henobarbital is the drug of choice for long-term treatment of idiopathic epilepsy in dogs. 1 To our knowledge, there has not been a study investigating the hepatotoxicity of phenobarbital in a controlled, prospective manner and over several months. Although it is generally well tolerated, phenobarbital reportedly can cause liver injury in dogs if administered alone or in combination with other drugs. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] It is still unclear whether phenobarbital-induced hepatotoxicity represents an idiosyncratic reaction or the extreme of a spectrum of toxicoses that develops in all dogs with chronic phenobarbital treatment. 8 None of the dogs that reportedly experienced liver injury during phenobarbital treatment was proven to have normal liver morphologic features before initiation of treatment. Many of the dogs were treated concomitantly with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. 4, 7 Phenobarbital is a hepatic microsomal enzyme inducer in dogs, causing proliferation of the hepatocyte smooth endoplasmatic reticulum, increased liver weight, and accelerated metabolism of various drugs and endogenous com-pounds. 9 ,10 Furthermore, this mechanism can cause increased serum liver enzyme activities without actual hepatocellular damage or biliary stasis, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] making it difficult to distinguish increases caused by enzyme induction from those caused by hepatic disease during phenobarbital treatment. Affected enzymes include serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine transaminase (ALT). Although there is some controversy in the literature, it seems that phenobarbital may induce hepatic aspartate transaminase (AST) and \u2425-glutamyltransferase (GGT) as well. Sulfobromophthalein retention, serum bilirubin, and fasted serum bile acids (fBA) were found not to be affected by the enzymeinducing effect of anticonvulsant drugs in dogs. 16, 17 No prospective study comparing changes in serum liver enzyme activites with the actual histopathologic appearance of the liver in previously normal dogs has been reported. The purposes of the present study were: (1) to determine the frequency and characteristics of phenobarbital hepatotoxicity at therapeutic serum concentrations in previously normal dogs during long-term monotherapy, and (2) to assess the impact of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activities by comparing them with serum bile acid concentrations and hepatic histopathologic values. We attempted to simulate the clinical circumstances encountered during the treatment of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy as closely as possible by selecting an initial drug dosage that would result in therapeutic serum concentrations after a few days and by treating the dogs over a prolonged period.",

Dogs were anesthetized with a mixture of 0.25 mg/kg diazepam plus 5 mg/kg ketamine, IV, through a cephalic vein catheter. The abdominal wall was penetrated with a stab incision, with a #15 blade. At least 3 liver tissue samples were collected under ultrasonographic guidance with a 16-guage biopsy needle m and an automatic biopsy gun, n conserved in formalin, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and examined with a light microscope. Radiographs, ultrasonograms, and histopathologic slides were evaluated in blinded fashion by the same people in randomized order. On radiographs, changes in liver size in individual dogs were determined according to a subjective scoring system, with size and length of the liver shadow as a marker for liver volume (\u2192, no change; \u2191, slight increase; \u2191\u2191, moderate increase; \u2191\u2191\u2191, marked increase). On ultrasound readings, liver echogenicity was compared with the echogenicity of the right renal cortex (hypo-, iso-or hyperechogenic). Renal cortical echogenicity was considered normal if the left renal cortex was hypoechoic to the spleen. The histopathologic slides of each dog were ranked according to the degree of the observed ''ground glass'' character of the cytoplasm (I, least; II, intermediate; III, most pronounced of the 3 slides).",

Moreover, these changes were not associated with particularly high serum ALP, ALT, bilirubin, or bile acid concentrations or particularly low serum albumin concentrations in the respective dogs at the respective times. The ground glass morphologic features of the hepatocytes during phenobarbital treatment were very similar to previous descriptions 15, [21] [22] [23] and are probably caused by proliferation of smooth endoplasmatic reticulum (SER) as a result of microsomal enzyme induction. A definitive diagnosis would have been possible only with electron microscopic evaluation. Hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes are found predominantly in a centrilobular location, 24, 25 but induction of the enzymes by phenobarbital occurs throughout the liver lobule in equal amounts, therefore diminishing the centrilobular dominance of drug-metabolizing activity. 24 This is in accordance with our finding that the ground glass change was equally distributed throughout the whole liver lobule. The fact that we were unable to distinguish slides of week 10 from slides of week 27 indicates that the SER proliferation had peaked by 10 weeks of treatment.",

The lack of histopathologic changes from week 10 to week 27 of treatment and the absence of radiographic, ultrasonographic, and microscopic evidence of liver damage after 27 weeks of treatment indicate that the effects of phenobarbital on the liver had reached a plateau phase by that time. However, the time frame of our study did not allow us to completely rule out that phenobarbital would act as an intrinsic hepatotoxin at therapeutic serum concentrations after a longer treatment period. Although the foci of perivascular inflammation in dogs 7 and 9 after 27 weeks were considered insignificant, they might have represented early signs of an idiosyncratic reaction in the respective animals. Liver biopsies at a later point would have been beneficial to assess the importance of these lesions. Further, it is still unclear whether cases of liver damage occurring at phenobarbital serum concentrations above 40 g/mL are caused by idiosyncratic reactions or caused by a dose-dependent, intrinsic toxicity. Prospective studies over several years with serum phenobarbital concentrations above the therapeutic range are needed to clarify this issue. Cases of morphologic liver damage occurring after a few months of treatment in dogs with serum phenobarbital concentrations within the therapeutic range are caused by an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug, the effects of additional hepatotoxins as proposed earlier, 5, 22 or an associated and independent underlying liver disease.",

Liver length, as measured on a lateral radiograph, is reliable in estimating liver volume in dogs. 26 The increase in liver size observed on radiographs probably was caused by enzyme induction, which causes SER proliferation and thus increased hepatocellular size and liver weight. 15, 27 Our radiographic findings suggest that there is a large variability in the degree of hepatic enlargement among dogs, with Beagles being more affected than the larger hounds and mixed breed dogs.",

Serum GGT also is increased by biliary stasis and drug induction. 25 In dogs, it is thought to be less sensitive, but more specific, for liver damage than ALP. 29 The lack of histopathologic evidence for biliary stasis indicates that increased GGT activities in our dogs were caused by enzyme induction. Moderate increases in serum GGT activities in dogs may occur because of phenobarbitalassociated enzyme induction, 12 but another study found no effect of the enzyme inducers, primidone and phenytoin, on GGT. 16 It is unclear why GGT activities, unlike ALP and ALT, decreased again toward the end of the study. Perhaps, enzyme induction lost its impact on GGT after this extended period. Focal and transient cholestasis (related or not to phenobarbital treatment) may have been responsible for the temporary increase in GGT. However, no other diagnostic tool assessing cholestasis (ALP, bile acids, liver biopsies, or ultrasonography) provided further support for this hypothesis.",

It appears that the increase in ALT is caused by enzyme induction and not by hepa-tocellular leakage, because one would expect a concomitant, but smaller, increase in AST in the latter instance. It seems that the 2 enzymes have a different susceptibility toward enzyme induction by phenobarbital in dogs.

Total bilirubin concentration did not change over time, and no concentration was above the reference range at any time. This finding confirms that fBA and total bilirubin are liver function tests that are not affected by the enzyme-inducing effects of phenobarbital. 8, 17 Our findings suggest that abnormal values for AST, serum albumin, total bilirubin, and fBA in dogs treated with phenobarbital cannot be attributed to the enzyme-inducing effect of the drug.
