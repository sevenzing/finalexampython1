This chapter employs the understandings of urban surface roughness to establish the relationship between heterogeneous urban morphologies and urban air ventilation environment. A new method with cross-section areas, which takes into account the site-specific wind information measured at 60 m height using the MM5/CALMET model simulation, was used to calculate the frontal area density (\u03bb f ).

The Davenport Classification is a surface-type classification based on the assorted surface roughness values, using high-quality observations (Davenport et al. 2000) , which covers a wide range of surface types. This method is not too helpful to describe urban permeability in highdensity cities, because most of the urban areas could only be described in Class 8 \"Skimming: City centre (z 0 \u2265 2)\". Compared with the micrometeorological method, the morphometric method estimates the aerodynamic characteristics, such as z 0 and z d , using empirical equations (Lettau 1969; MacDonald et al. 1998; Raupach 1992; Bottema 1996; Kutzbach 1961) . Grimmond and Oke (1999) validated the empirical models by Kutzbach, Lettau, Raupach, Bottema, and Macdonald.

Due to the complex topography of Hong Kong, the territory is divided into subareas, with various area-specific wind roses ( Fig. 2.6 ). The data on site-specific wind roses were obtained from the fifth-generation NCAR/PSU mesoscale model (MM5) that incorporates the California Meteorological (CALMET) system (Yim et al. 2007 ). MM5 is a limited-area, non-hydrostatic, and terrain-following mesoscale meteorological model. MM5 is designed to simulate mesoscale and regional-scale atmospheric circulation (Dudhia 1993; Yim et al. 2007 ). CALMET is a diagnostic three-dimensional meteorological model that can interface with MM5 (Scire et al. 2000) . The terrain in Hong Kong is complex; hence, the resolution used in MM5 simulations (typically down to 1 km) cannot accurately capture the influence of topology characteristics on wind environment. Therefore, CALMET, a prognostic meteorological model capable of higher resolutions (down to 100 m), was used. Combining the data obtained from MM5 and the data obtained from an upper air sounding station, maintained by the Hong Kong Observatory, in 2004, the CALMET model adjusts the estimated meteorological fields for the kinematic effects of terrain, slope flows, and terrain blocking effects to reflect the impact of a fine-scale terrain on resultant wind fields at 100 m resolutions (Yim et al. 2007) .
