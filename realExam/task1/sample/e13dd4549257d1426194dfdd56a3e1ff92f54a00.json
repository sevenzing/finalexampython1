The spike protein on this virus binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, mediating entry into human cells. The angiotensin-converting enzyme/Angiotensin II/Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor) and 2 ACE2/angiotensin (1-7)/Mas receptor (ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor) pathways are antagonistic parts of the renin-angiotensin system. It has been found that infection with SARS-CoV (now sometimes called SARS-CoV-1), a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, induced a decrease of membrane ACE2 receptors on host cells, resulting in an imbalance of ACE/ACE2 and triggering severe lung injury (Kuba et al., 2005) . The above mechanisms may also contribute critically to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.",

Neurological symptoms such as disturbance of consciousness, epilepsy and neuralgia may indicate invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system . Although the expression of ACE2 receptor in the human nervous system has not been fully identified, ACE2 was detected in neuron and microglia in the spinal dorsal horn of mice (Yamagata et al., 2020) . Previous studies showed that the ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor pathway facilitated pain transmission in the spinal dorsal horn, while the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway might alleviate pain through the inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (Nemoto et al., 2013; Yamagata et al., 2020) . We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might infect the ACE2-positive cells in human spinal dorsal horn; the decrease of functional ACE2 then results in the accumulation of Ang II and the decrease of Ang (1-7); consequently, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the spinal cord could induce pain.",
