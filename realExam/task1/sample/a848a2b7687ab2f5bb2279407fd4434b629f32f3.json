Methods: Women with ovarian cancer whose cancer recurred after remission were categorized by first method that their provider suspected disease recurrence: CA-125, imaging, symptoms, or physical exam. Differences in clinicopathologic, primary treatment characteristics, and outcomes data including secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) outcome and overall survival (OS) were collected. Results: 102 patients were identified at our institution from 2003 to 2015. 20 recurrences were detected by symptoms, while 62 recurrences were diagnosed first by asymptomatic rise in CA-125, 5 by pelvic exam, and 15 by imaging in the absence of known exam abnormality or rise in CA-125.",

Patients whose disease was detected by CA-125 were less likely to undergo SCS than those detected by other means (21.7% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.007). In addition to the 5 patients whose recurrence was detected primarily by pelvic exam, an additional 10 (total n = 15) patients had an abnormal pelvic exam at time of diagnosis of recurrence. Discussion: Recurrence detection method was not associated with differing rates of survival or optimal SCS, however those patients detected by CA-125 were less likely to undergo SCS. The pelvic exam was a useful tool for detecting a significant proportion of recurrences.",

Our study, therefore, does not lend support to the association of higher rates of SCS or subsequent patient survival with early recurrence detection by CA-125. Additionally, the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery has been recently questioned, with the results of showing no survival benefit with the use of SCS (Coleman et al., 2019) . The publication of DESKTOP-III is awaited to add to this discussion (Du Bois et al., 2017) . If CA-125 screening is not associated with prolonged survival and the role of SCS is unclear, it is important to carefully consider the utility of surveillance CA-125 for women with ovarian cancer.",
