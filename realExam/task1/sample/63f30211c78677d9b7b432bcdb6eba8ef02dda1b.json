Mass media have given great emphasis to the high risk of contamination in hospitals, and this fear may have prevented many patients, and their relatives, from asking for hospital admissions, even in clinical situations (such as psychotic disorders) which may usually require inpatient care.

In other words, patients and family members may have become more tolerant during the epidemic, avoiding referrals to hospital facilities for the fear of exposure to the risk of contamination. At the same time, clinicians may have been more cautious in admitting unknown patients or patients at risk for infection or with uncertain recent contacts or movements, in order to preserve the integrity of psychiatric wards, other patients and healthcare professionals from a possible contagion. This may have produced a similar reduction of access to other hospital wards for patients with other medical conditions: interestingly, a report from 15 Italian hospitals located in Northern Italy, comparing the same periods covered in our study, shows a significant decrease in hospitalization rates related to acute coronary syndrome in all sites during the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak (De Filippo et al. 2020).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Change in thresholds for hospitalization"}, {"text": "A decrease in admission rates may have been balanced by an increase of outpatient activities.

The longer length of stay in March 2020 (COVID-19 period) as compared to the same month in 2019 is probably due to the difficulty in guaranteeing a 'safe' return home for inpatients because in March lockdown became universal and stringent. Overall, the parallel reduction of new admissions, with less pressure to discharge inpatients to free beds for new admissions, may have contributed to a change in length of stay. The shorter length of stay for people with SSD may be explained by the fact that these patients are generally closely monitored in the community and that hospitalization occurs following a decompensation which can often be rapidly resolved leading to discharge.
