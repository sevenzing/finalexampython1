They are constructed to handle them with variations of several standard deviations. However, preparation for Xevents is costly and often imcompatible with the requirements of everyday use. Therefore, it is often neglected. Moreover, Xevents [1, 2] often do not obey common statistical distributions. Their distribution is instead characterized by \"fat tails\" [1] [2] [3] , which implies a much higher frequency of occurrence than expected according to a normal distribution. These fat tails often follow a power law, which is characteristic of systems that reach a critical point and suffer from avalanche or cascade effects of a potentially arbitrary size. In some cases, it is even impossible to make statements about the mean value or the standard deviation of such events, as power-law distributions are not always normalizable. Typical examples of systems that exhibit power laws are -avalanches of sand, debris or snow [4, 5] -earthquakes (see the Gutenberg-Richter law) -crashes and bubbles at stock markets -bankruptcies in banking networks -disaster scenarios [6] The detailed impact of rare events on a system is often unknown. Possible scenarios can, however, be anticipated using models that describe the interactions between different parts (\"sectors\") of the system. These interactions are mostly nonlinear and characterized by feedbacks. As a consequence, small changes in the system state can have large effects when a certain critical threshold is exceeded. Such effects can be described by methods from systems theory and system dynamics, catastrophe theory [7] , the theory of nonequilibrium phase transitions, nonlinear dynamics and the theory of complex, self-organizing systems. Insights from chaos theory and percolation theory are relevant as well. The same applies to the theory of networks. Despite many reports on disasters [9, 10] , a scientific investigation of their general features and ways to fight them is still needed. Each year, about 250 million people are affected by natural disasters worldwide. Three billion people live in endangered areas. The economic impact, and also the number and size of disasters seem to grow, potentially because of overpopulation and global warming due to CO 2 emissions and the greenhouse effect. In 2003, disasters took 60,000 victims and caused a damage worth 70 billion US dollars (see Table 15 .1), while insurance schemes paid out 18.5 billion US dollars.

The tendency towards globalization of economic and other systems is likely to increase the frequency of large-scale disasters, as it reduces the diversity required to stop certain chain reactions and to adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions.

This is because of -the growing and highly fluctuating demands for power (due to, for example, an increased number of air conditioners), -the increasing size and complexity of electrical power networks (often with power being exchanged across countries), The largest blackout probably occurred in 2003 in north-eastern areas of North America (USA and Canada), which were followed by other major blackouts in Great Britain and Northern Italy in the same year. The blackout in the USA and Canada left 50 million people without electricity for up to 48 hours. The sudden breakdown of one power station caused a cascade of shutdowns at other power stations in order to avoid overloading. The blackout affected the water supply as the water pumps stopped functioning so the water pressure dropped and contamination became more likely. The advice given, to boil water before use, was difficult to follow without electricity. Moreover, traffic systems stopped working, so thousands of people were imprisoned in elevators and subway trains, and many airports were closed. Traffic lights switched off, causing widespread traffic chaos. Petrol stations could not pump fuel due to the lack of electricity for their pumps. Although radio and TV stations did broadcast, most radios ran off mains power. The mobile phone network broke down due to overload. Only conventional telephones and laptops with internet connections remained functional so long as their batteries and accumulators had power. For this reason, the ability to inform the public about the situation was extremely limited. As gas pumps did not function, there was an explosion at one of the oil refineries, which meant that the population nearby had to be evacuated. Moreover, the use of candles caused several fires, which were hard to fight because the traffic chaos on the streets slowed down firefighter response.
