The filtering efficiency of these masks were tested before and after sterilisation using gamma radiation for the two flow rate conditions corresponding normal breath rate (20lpm) and during sneezing/coughing (90lpm).Sterilisation is carried out using a gamma irradiator containing Co-60 source for the two dose exposures viz. 15kGy and 25kGy.The filtering efficiency for surgical (nonwoven fabric) and double layer cotton cloth mask is found to vary from 18% to 22% for the cumulative particle of size \u2265 0.3\u00b5m in both un-irradiated and irradiated condition. The filtration efficiency of N95 mask is found to be reduced to 70% for the most penetrating particle size (0.3 \u00b5m) with the flow rate of 20lpm and further reduced for particles in the range of 0.1 and 0.2\u00b5m with flow rate of 90 lpm. The reduction in efficiency after gamma sterilization is associated with reduction of electrostatic interaction of filter medium with particles laden in the air stream. Even with reduced filtering efficiency due to gamma sterilisation, the N95 masks are much superior than the surgical and cloth masks. Instead of disposing N95 mask after single use, they can be reused a few times as N70 mask during this pandemic crisis after sterilisation using gamma radiation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "One of the essential personal protective equipment (PPE) against COVID-19 infection for the human being is face mask, which offers protection against infectious respiratory droplets or particles like corona virus-laden aerosols around the globe (Feng et al., 2020 and Kin et al., 2020) .As millions of masks are being used, it is become necessary for the multiple use of the masks in this pandemic crisis for the public, the staff on the frontline workers in health-care, and police force personnel in order to avoid any shortages. It is often considered as good practice to sterilize the masks by killing the secondary pathogens before reusing. Many authorities (governments, manufacturers, scientists and experts) are looking to expand the availability facemask by sterilizing them with effective methods. Under these premises, multiple potential methods for sterilization have begun to be explored. Some are based on chemical methods (hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, bleach, alcohol, soap solution and ethylene oxide, ozone decontamination etc.) and physical methods (dry /steam heat treatment, UV light sterilization, electron beam and gamma irradiation etc.) (Kumar et al., 2015 and Lei et al., 2020). All above sterilisation method having advantages and disadvantages from one than others (Avilash et. al., 2020 and Juan et al., 2020).Among the different methods, the available literature seems to point out that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat, ozone gas and gamma irradiation. The methods that are not recommended for disinfection or sterilization such as cleaning with soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, microwave, high temperature, autoclave or steam because they can significantly degrade the filter, because they alter or degrade the electrostatic properties of the filter fibre sand affect particle penetration levels leading to mask degradation (Juan et al., 2020) . Ozone gas appears to be effective in decontaminating respirators mask without damaging the facemask, although it presents risks for the safety and health of workers who carry out the process if it is not .
