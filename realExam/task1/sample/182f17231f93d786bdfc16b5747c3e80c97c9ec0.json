The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented crisis for patients, clinicians, and healthcare systems in the United States (US). In response, US Federal and State governments have implemented wide-ranging stay-at-home recommendations as a means to reduce spread, and have ordered non-essential businesses to temporarily close. At the time of this writing, social distancing is the only known way to mitigate the continued spread of COVID-19, as there is currently no proven vaccine or treatment. In an effort to reduce patient exposure and transmission of disease, to conserve supplies, and to maximize personnel that are needed to provide care to the large number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization, many US healthcare systems have reduced ambulatory outpatient clinics-pillars of the longitudinal care of patients with chronic illnesses such as heart failure (HF).

The aims of this pilot study were to test the feasibility and safety of substituting in-person visits with VVs for patients (n=108) transitioning from hospital-to-home after hospitalization for HF, and to assess to what degree VVs can reduce appointment no-show rates. The no-show rate in the VV arm trended lower than observed rate in the in-person arm (VV 34.6% versus IPV 50%; RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; P=0.12), without any signal of harm-no significant differences in hospital readmission, emergency room visit, or death between the study arms. 7 Yet, despite its promise, wide utilization of VVs in the US healthcare environment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic has been limited due to lack of familiarity with technologies among both clinicians and patients, concerns about the safety of substituting inperson visits with VVs, lack of integration into clinicians' established workflows, perceived and actual legal barriers, and limited payer reimbursement. 8 In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these barriers have now disappeared given the importance of social distancing.

Accordingly, VVs may present some challenges in selected circumstances. Some patients may be reluctant to participate in VVs because they feel uncomfortable with technology, or feel self-conscious about interacting on video. These feelings may become less common as VVs enter the mainstream. VVs present a barrier to performing a full physical exam, though many components of a partial exam can be completed, and existing and emerging diagnostic technologies and wearables may fill in the gaps. This is discussed further below. Some clinicians and patients may feel that even with the use of video, VVs are not the same as in-person visits with respect to patient-physician interactions-something is lost without close proximity and the -laying on of hand.\u2016 Some patients may have limited access to the internet, and/or may not have a computer or smart device to engage in VVs, including the poor or elderly in inner city or rural areas. Although there may be geographic and financial challenges to obtaining WiFi for some patients, we anticipate that future technology will provide \"hotspots\" via ubiquitous cellular networks alleviating most barriers to internet access. Some health care systems are investing in these technologies and providing equipment and connectivity to ensure that telehealth does not widen health disparities. 10, 11 Older adults may be viewed as a subpopulation where these challenges are common. This is particularly important because over half of patients currently living with HF in the US is older than 70 years. 12 However, recent data show that an increasing number of older adults possess smartphones, and that some guidance to using newer technology can be taught, possibly by hospital/clinic support teams. 13 Integration of the VVs technology platform within an institution's electronic portal or app, which is already familiar to patients, may be another approach to overcoming these challenges.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1453, "end": 1456, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1459, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1663, "text": "12", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1862, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Challenges to virtual care"}, {"text": "Patients and clinicians may occasionally encounter technical difficulties when conducting VVs.

Many commercial insurance providers reimbursed urgent care VVs (i.e., substitution of in-person emergency room or urgent care visits), with only a small number reimbursing for primary care or specialty care VVs. Meanwhile, some hospitals have started offering VVs in selected settings for certain high-risk conditions (including HF), spending institutional resources in hopes that longterm savings through bundled payment models would ultimately compensate for the associated costs of VVs, while others have offered VVs in exchange for direct cash payment from patients.In March 2020, following announcement of the COVID-19 public health emergency and the 1135 Waiver, several important telehealth-related reimbursement changes occurred. CMS announced that VVs, referred to as -telehealth visits\u2016 in CMS documents, would be reimbursed at the same rate as in-person visits during the COVID-19 crisis, without limits on the purpose of the visits, the geographical location of patients, and whether or not there was a previously established relationship with the provider. Multiple commercial insurance providers including Aetna, Cigna, Humana, and Blue Cross Blue Shield among others have followed suit. Waivers of beneficiary co-pays for these telehealth services vary among these providers.To secure reimbursement at the current time, documentation for VVs should approximate documentation for in-person ambulatory clinic visits. We recommend that clinicians explicitly document that a virtual (audio/video) visit was completed, with the patient's consent.Clinicians should document the amount of time it took to conduct the visit in minutes. Specific CPT billing codes and relevant modifiers are shown inTable 3. The future state of EHR documentation for VVs may include capture of images or streaming clips of video interactions, automated transcription of key components of the conversation, and use of natural language processing to determine meaning and summarize information.According to HHS, -a covered health care provider that wants to use audio or video communication technology to provide telehealth to patients during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency can use any non-public facing remote communication product that is available to communicate with patients.\u2016 Non-public facing products are typically platforms that employ end-to-end encryption, and which allows only an individual and the person with whom the individual is communicating to see what is transmitted. On the other hand, public facing platforms (i.e., Facebook Live, Twitch, and TikTok) are designed to be open to the public or allow wide or indiscriminate access to the communication.Table 4outlines and describes some common platforms that may be used for VVs.
