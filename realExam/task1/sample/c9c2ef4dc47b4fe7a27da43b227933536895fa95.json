The logic is that face masks are low cost and might help prevent some transmission. However, from the start, the assumption that face masks are \"low cost\" was questioned. Early on, there were warnings of the opportunity cost of public use of medical masks given shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare providers. This led to recommendations for cloth masks and other face coverings, with little evidence of their ability to prevent transmission. However, there may also be a high cost to these recommendations if people rely on face masks in place of other more effective ways to break transmission, such as staying home. We use SafeGraph smart device location data to show that the representative American in states that have face mask mandates spent 20-30 minutes less time at home, and increase visits to a number of commercial locations, following the mandate. Since the reproductive rate of SAR-COV2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19 is hovering right around one, such substitution behavior could be the difference between controlling the epidemic and a resurgence of cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "At the time of writing, 36 States in the United States are requiring some use of face masks in public to combat the COVID-19 epidemic. Similar regulations exist around the world. The evidence that maskwearing by the general public reduces COVID-19 cases is scant, and the evidence that does exist suggests that the benefits depend on correct usage (Bae et al. 2020; Leung et al. 2020; Mahase 2020; Howard et al. 2020; Mueller and Fernandez 2020) . The arguments in favor of masks are that they do no harm, are low cost, and they could provide benefits (Brosseau and Sietsema 2020) . However, whether encouraging people to wear masks does no harm and whether they are low cost are important questions.

If the purpose of wearing face masks were only to protect the wearer from COVID-19, then going out with a mask could still be privately optimal so long as masks provide protection equivalent to additional minutes at home. Of course, if people overestimate the private protection conveyed by face masks, then this could be a privately suboptimal decision. It is unlikely, however, that individuals fully account for the costs of their own illness in terms of hospital congestion and other externalized costs. More importantly, the real benefit of mask-wearing or staying home is preventing the spread of COVID-19 by infectious and potentially asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, wearing a mask could create an un-internalized cost if masks do not prevent asymptomatic individuals from spreading the pathogen. Just as wearing a seat belt can encourage less safe driving while conferring no protection to others from such actions, if masks do not prevent infectious individuals from spreading the pathogen, then they induce an externality (Richens, Imrie, and Copas 2000) . This is a particular concern, because of the oft cited externality associated with pathogen spread and protective behavior -people typically fail to account for how their behavior prevents spreading the pathogen to others (Gersovitz 2011) .
