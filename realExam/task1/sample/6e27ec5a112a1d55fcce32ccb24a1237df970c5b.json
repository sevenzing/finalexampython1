For example, the event of \"Toyota 2009-2010 vehicle recalls\" contains several interrelated component events, e.g., the event \"Toyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\" causes the happening of the event \"NHTSA conduct investigations for Toyota recall\" and the event \"US congressional hearings hold for Toyota recall\", and so on.

Indeed, they are often interested in the whole picture of an event evolution or development along a timeline. This calls for modeling the dependence relationships between component events, and identifying which component events play important roles in the entire event evolution or development. Unfortunately, the current news web sites do not facilitate people in finding out relevant news articles easily, and people may need to go through all these news articles in order to find out the interrelationships between component events. Current prevailing search engines (such as Google, Yahoo and so on) allow users to input event keywords as a query and return a list of news web pages related to the query. However, instead of organizing the result by events and relationships between events, these engines just provide users with a ranking list of news web pages. It is difficult and time consuming for users to view of the huge amount of news articles and to obtain the main picture of an event. Therefore, it is necessary to provide an effective way for users to efficiently search events they are interested in, and organize the search results in an easily understandable manner syntactically, so that users can obtain the main pictures of their interested events easily and meaningfully from the semantic perspective.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Although there have been some previous works attempting to find and link incidents in news [2] [3] or discover the event evolution graphs [17] [15] , they only focus on time sequence and content similarity between two component events in identifying their dependence relationships.

For example, event \"Toyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\" shares little similar content with events \"NHTSA conduct investigations for Toyota recall\" and \"US congressional hearings hold for Toyota recall\". It is obvious that the first event has a strong effect on the latter two events as it caused them to happen. Unfortunately, previous works do not analyze the event relationships well and cannot find out the dependence relationships between any two events which do not share enough similar content.

The new characteristics of the proposed framework and the contributions of our work are as follows.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "-In previous works, to discover dependence relationships between events, content similarity of events is measured by matching the keywords (terms) of events. However, there may be some keywords (in two events) which are actually related/ dependent but not identical. For example, \"hospital\" and \"doctor\" are dependent, but previous methods treat them as no relationship. To avoid this limitation, we adopt mutual information to measure the dependence between two terms (features), and then aggregate all mutual information between features in events to measure the content dependence degree between events. Such a process is named as content dependence (CD) analysis and the dependence relationship discovered based on dependence features of two events is named as content dependence relationship. -As mentioned in paragraph 4, only content dependence analysis on events is inadequate to detect all event dependence relationships. According to the studies in Journalism [11] and our observation, it is not unusual for authors (reporters) to write news articles on an event by referring to other events, when the authors consider there is a dependent relationship between them. For instance, some news articles about the event \"Toyota recall due to safety problems from 2009 to 2010\" refer to the event \"NHTSA conduct investigations for Toyota recall\". Motivated by this prevalent phenomena, We explore event reference (ER) analysis to detect whether there is an inter-event relationship specified by authors. The relationship between two events discovered by ER analysis is named as event reference (ER) relationship, which has not been explored by previous works. -In contrast to previous works which only consider temporal relationship and content similarity, we adopt three kinds of event relationships (viz, temporal relationship, CD relationship obtained by CD analysis and ER relationship obtained by ER analysis) to identify the dependence relationship between two events. Note that CD and ER relationships are essentially event dependence relationships which are discovered by two different ways respectively. We name them by two different names with respect to the different ways for discovering them. CD relationships and ER relationships can be complementary to each other in identifying event dependence relationships. -The search results are organized by a temporal event map (TEM) which constitutes the whole picture about an event's evolution or development along the timeline. Figure 1 shows an example TEM of the event \"Toyota 2009-2010 vehicle recalls\". A TEM provides a way to organize and represent the events search results by showing the interrelationships between/among the events. It provides an easier and more efficient means for users to know and understand their interested events in a comprehensive way. -To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments on a real data set by comparing with a number of baseline methods. Experiment results show that our method outperforms baselines in discovering event dependence relationships. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we formulate the event search problem. Section 3 introduces the (temporal) event search framework. We conduct experiments on a real data set to evaluate the proposed methods for event search in section 4. In section 5, to further illustrate and evaluate our method, we study a query case about the event \"SARS\" happened in 2003. Related works are studied in section 6.

Therefore, the standard answer set is an aggregation of the annotations given by all the annotators.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experiment Setting"}, {"text": "For the evaluation we use P recision, Recall and F \u2212 measure as the metrics.

The metrics are defined as follows:", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Experiment Setting"}, {"text": "In constructing TEM , there is a parameter \u03b1 which is used to prune the \"weak\" event dependency relationships. So first, we test different values of \u03b1 to evaluate the effect of \u03b1 on Precision, Recall and F-measure for setting the best value of parameter \u03b1 for the following experiment. In our testing, we use two query events, one is \"SARS in 2003\" Figure 2 shows the effect of \u03b1 on Precision, Recall and F-measure. According to Fig. 2 , we find that as \u03b1 increases, the Precision and F-measure increase while Recall decreases. The reason is that when the value \u03b1 is small, there are many event dependence relationships whose dependence degree is great than \u03b1 (but the dependence relationship is still actually \"weak\"), so the Recall is high and the P recision is low.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 349, "end": 357, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 429, "end": 435, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Experiment Results"}, {"text": "As \u03b1 increases, more and more event dependence relationships of which dependence degree is lower than \u03b1 are pruned, so the Recall becomes lower and the P recision becomes higher.

After setting the value of \u03b1, we conduct all test queries and average the results of them on different metrics. Figures 3-5 show the comparison of our method with all the three baseline methods on P recision, Recall and F \u2212 measure. According to  it is obvious that our method outperforms all the baseline methods on P recision, Recall and F \u2212measure. The P recision and Recall values of our method are around 0.8, meaning that not only most event dependence relationships discovered by our method are correct, but also our method can discover more event dependence relationships than the baselines. Our method's F \u2212 measure score is also around 0.8 since it is a combination of P recision and Recall. Note that CDM outperforms EEG a little on all the metrics, indicating that using mutual information to measure feature ERM outperforms EEG and CDM on all three metrics. It indicates that using event reference analysis (i.e., ERM ) to identify event dependence relationships is more effective than using content dependence relationship analysis (i.e., CDM ) and content similarity analysis (i.e., EEG). Besides, it is quite interesting to see that the Recall of CDM is greater than that of ERM , while both of them are smaller than that of our method. This means that the event dependence relationships identified by CDM and ERM are indeed different and complementary, and our method being a combination of CDM and ERM has the strength of both methods'.
