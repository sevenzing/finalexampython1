However, little attention has been paid to their biological function. In this study, we isolated the acidic protein fraction of bovine colostrum (AFC, isoelectric point <5) by anion-exchange chromatography, and investigated the effect of its dietary intake on influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. 100% of mice infected with 1 LD50 of the virus survived when administered AFC for 14 days prior to infection, compared with 33% survival when administered phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Moreover, consumption of AFC reduced the weight loss associated with infection. We propose that dietary intake of AFC has a prophylactic effect on influenza A virus infection.",

The H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A and influenza B are widely recognized as causes of seasonal flu (Goldstein et al., 2011) . The virus can evade humoral immunity by antigenic drift, i.e. changes in the amino acid sequence of the surface hemag-glutinin and/or neuraminidase (Webster et al., 1982; Sandbulte et al., 2011) , which is why influenza can cause epidemics annually. Although in most cases symptoms resolve within a week without the need for treatment, in high-risk groups influenza can lead to severe illness or death (World Health Organization, 2009 ). In the United States, the influenza-attributable mortality rate is estimated at 1.4-16.7 deaths per 100,000 cases, which translates to between 3,339 and 48,614 deaths annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2010) . Influenza is a serious public health and economic issue. In developed countries especially, epidemics can result in high levels of worker absenteeism and productivity losses (World Health Organization, 2009 ). Therefore, much effort has been put into preventing infections.",

Although there are differences in the oligosaccharide contents, both colostrums have been regarded to have biological functions to modulate diseases. Previous reports have shown that human colostrum can modulate the immune system and enhance protection against pathogens (Claud et al., 2003; Wang and Brand-Miller, 2003) . Dietary intake of bovine colostrum has also been suggested to prevent upper respiratory tract (URT) infections (Brinkworth and Buckley, 2003) . However, there has been no direct evidence that dietary bovine colostrum enhances protection against influenza infection. The amount of acidic proteins and sialic acid in milk is known to decrease significantly as lactation progresses (Bezkorovainy, 1965; Wang and Brand-Miller, 2003) , therefore, the acidic protein fraction is thought to have an important function in colostrum. In this study we isolated the acidic protein fraction of bovine colostrum (AFC) and investigated how dietary intake of AFC modulates the symptoms of influenza infection.",

It has been suggested that bovine colostrum is composed of 50-75, 25-35, and 5-20 kDa proteins (Senda et al., 2011) , and our results were consistent with this finding. The 24-31 kDa protein band was the most prominent in AFC, the largest proportion of which was the 28 kDa fraction (Fig. 2) . We also compared the isoelectric points (pIs) of the proteins in the starting sample and in AFC (Fig. 3) . Most of the proteins in AFC had pIs <5 (Fig. 3B) , while the pIs of the proteins in the starting sample ranged from 4 to 10 (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that AFC contains mainly acidic proteins.",

We also compared the changes in body weight in the three groups infected with 0.2 LD 50 . As shown in Fig. 5 , the mice in the oseltamivir and AFC groups experienced no change in body weight, while significant weight loss was observed in the PBS group in days 4 to 7 after infection.

            "text": "Picornaviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses and influenza viruses are the causal pathogens in the vast majority of URT infections (Fendrick et al., 2003) . Dietary supplementation with concentrated bovine colostrum proteins has been shown to reduce the incidence of symptoms of URT infection in adult men (Brinkworth and Buckley, 2003) . Recently, Patiroglu and Kondolot also reported that oral administration of bovine colostrum lessened the severity of viral URT infections in IgA-deficient children (Patiroglu and Kondolot, 2011) . Based on these findings, we hypothesized that bovine colostrum would improve the symptoms associated with influenza virus. We performed a large number of animal experiments investigating the effect of total bovine colostrum, and found that while some experiments yielded significant reductions in influenza-related morbidity and mortality, the symptom-ameliorating effects of the same bovine colostrum products varied significantly (Supplementary data Fig. S1 ). Therefore, the effect of total bovine colostrums on influenza virus infection in mice was significantly different from our expectation. On the other hand, AFC showed promising effect for ameliorating symptoms caused by influenza infections (Figs. 4 and 5) . Previous studies implied that the intestinal conditions, i.e. bacterial flora and digestive enzymes involved in the absorption of colostrum components differed between human and animal subjects (Petschow and Talbott, 1994; Johnson et al., 2007; Kobayashi et al., 2012) . In other words, some components contained in bovine colostrum decrease the ameliorating effect or hinder the functions of novel compenents. We suggest that separations of novel components such as AFC from the hindering components are thought to be critical in mouse experiment. We found that AFC contains significantly higher level of proteins harboring \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids than total bovine colostrums and acid protein fraction of mature bovine milk does (Supplementary data Fig. S2) , indicating that the anionexchange chromatography separates sialic acid rich fraction from the bovine colostrum. The sialic acid is known to inhibit influenza virus-mediated haemagglutination and infection (Matrosovich and Klenk, 2003) . In addition, \u03b12,3linked sialic acid is a cell receptor for influenza A virus infection (Glaser et al., 2005) . Therefore, it is assumed that other components of AFC such as free sialyl oligosaccharides may be beneficial on ameliorating the symptom caused by influenza virus infection. The composition and quality of pooled colostrum is known to depend on a number of factors, such as the health of the cows, the timing of colostrum collection, and the manufacturing process (Kelly, 2003) . However, it is uncertain what amount of each component is required for its biological activity, and what specific components are biologically active in specific diseases, and this has hindered the standardization of bovine colostrums (Struff and Sprotte, 2007) . Therefore, we believe that separating novel factors from colostrum, and collecting more data on the composition of colostrum and the activity of its components are critical for obtaining high-quality colostrum products.",
