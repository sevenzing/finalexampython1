In Central American countries like Guatemala and Panama, Indigenous Peoples have endured centuries of war, internal violence, exile, marginalisation, genocide and other trauma. The existence of imposed trauma and decimation began when Spaniards invaded Panama in the early 16th century (Central Intelligence Agency, 2020).

In Australia, the Health Department advice is for Australians aged 70 years or over, or those aged 65 years or over with chronic medical conditions to stay at home and avoid all contact with other people. However, for Indigenous Peoples, this recommendation is for those aged over 50 years (Department of Health, 2020b Historical data have demonstrated that poor health and poverty positively correlate with pandemic severity (Clay, Lewis, & Severnini, 2019) . Poverty impacts Indigenous Peoples' capacity to respond to COVID-19 on multiple levels. In this current crisis, health outcomes are determined by levels of secure housing, employment, comorbidities, functional literacy, health insurance, food security, access to running water, access to health care and technology. A one-size-fits-all response to COVID-19 ignores the roles of privilege, affluence and racism in perpetuating inequities, and therefore the ability to provide culturally safe care (Best, 2018) . Globally, many Indigenous Peoples live on missions and reserves. Many of these missions and reserves are geographically rural or remote. Among the 574 tribes in the USA, the Navajo Nation is the third highest population in the nation for per capita infections after New York and New Jersey. As of 22nd May 2020, the Navajo Nation had over 4,253 positive cases and 146 deaths from COVID-19 (Navajo Department of Health, 2020a). Older age, multigenerational housing, lack of running water, communal wells, (Maclean & Elphick, 2020) . On the 26th March 2020, the Minister invoked biosecurity travel restrictions for remote areas. People wishing to enter remote communities must self-isolate for 14 days prior to entry (National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA), 2020). Assurances that \"Governments will support people who do not have appropriate alternate arrangements to self-isolate\" are not trusted (NIAA, 2020). Some communities are hundreds of kilometres and many hours away from regional centres, and where people would be accommodated is not clear. Furthermore, this support has not been evident for other Aboriginal people, with media reports of rough sleepers having camps broken up by police, and possessions thrown into garbage trucks (Hirini, 2020) .",

Iwi (tribal nations) are distributing food parcels to older people who cannot leave their homes and whanau (Family) rather than expecting people to make their way to a food bank.

In Central America, statistical transparency among Indigenous groups related to previous pandemics and other health outcomes is lacking, further perpetuating the lack of Indigenous voice and increasing the health disparity gap (Babyar, 2019) . Failure to recognise the differences in morbidity and mortality among Indigenous Peoples contributes to inequities. There is not only a lack of information sharing but the delay in funding to support nations, and the growing jurisdictional disputes over who will provide these services has once again been intensified in the response to COVID pandemic planning. If ever there was a time to acknowledge the need to collect accurate ethnicity data and disseminate adequate resources to address health disparities among Indigenous people globally, now is that time.

Forty per cent of Navajo households do not have access to running water, and thirty per cent do not have electricity (DigDeep & US Water Alliance, 2020). Lack of access to running water makes it difficult to comply with handwashing recommendations. Additionally, many Native American tribes, such as the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, are not eligible to receive federal funds to provide health care (Maynor Lowery, 2009, 2018). The marginalisation, segregation and discrimination of these tribes are negatively impacting their health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 situation. These tribes are relying upon their own resources to address their tribal community needs. Likewise, in Central America, many Indigenous groups live in low-or middle-income countries lacking fundamental basic human needs such as clean water and environment to live in, resulting in higher rates of infectious disease such as COVID-19 (Babyar, 2019). To help curb the spread of COVID-19, the Navajo Department of Health ordered all members within their 17-million-acre reservation/jurisdiction, over the age of 2 years to wear masks in public and have instituted isolation measures including weekend curfews. Unnecessary travel is punishable by up to 30 days incarceration or a $1,000 (USD) fine (Navajo Department of Health, 2020b). Similar lockdowns are evident across the globe. In Australia, enactment of the Biosecurity Act 2015 has given the Federal Minister of Health extraordinary powers",

This also demonstrates one of the unique differences globally among Indigenous populations in locking down communities. Within Australia, Indigenous Peoples have a history of being confined to designated areas called missions and reserves. This was government policy from approximately the 1890s to 1970s (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), 2019). In other global Indigenous populations, locking down has been a self-determined process. Within Australia, the question of triggering episodes of post-traumatic stress has arisen for those older Indigenous Peoples who still live on the missions and reserves. Being locked down again due to government intervention and legislation as they were up until the early 1970s in the state of Queensland is still in the lived experiences of a number of Indigenous Australians. Characteristics of crises like pandemics include a rapid increase in rape, sexual assault and violence (Peterman et al., 2020). Indigenous people worldwide are already at increased risk of family violence, a consequence of colonisation and historical trauma, (Wilson, Mikahere-Hall, Sherwood, Cootes, & Jackson, 2019), with \"prevalence rates of 57% and 80% found for lifetime violence among w\u0101hine M\u0101ori\" (women; Wilson et al., 2019, p. 15). \"Aboriginal women [in Australia] are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised for family violence as non-Aboriginal women\"(Andrews, 2020, para. 3). In Canada, First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis women are two and half times more likely to experience violence than nonindigenous women(Klingspohn, 2018). In the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (NIMMIWG) (2019) in Canada, the sexual and physical abuse and murder of Indigenous women and girls that have been ongoing for generations have been labelled genocide. Native American women sustain rates of violent victimisation (rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault) at rates that are two times higher than African Americans, two and a half times that of Hispanics, two and a half times that of Caucasians, and four times that of Asians(Morgan & Oudekerk, 2019). The current COVID-19 crisis has seen \"reports from Australia, Brazil, China and the United States suggesting a sudden rise in violence against women and children\"(Peterman et al., 2020, p. 3).",

Despite the marginalisation of Indigenous Peoples in countries' COVID-19 responses, Indigenous communities are instituting their own measures in the presence of universal approaches to managing not only the spread of COVID-19 but in addressing the needs borne out of poverty, housing and food insecurity.
