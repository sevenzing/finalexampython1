            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has many individuals around the world fearing for their lives. The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study was to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1624 participants of which 1397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1111 participants of which 1023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scale's reliability and validity. Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores. The English version of the COVID-19S is a sound unidimensional scale with robust psychometric properties and can be used with confidence among English-speaking populations.",

In brief, this allowed the implementation of a four-level Alert System. Alert Level 4 was implemented between March 26 and April 27, with all businesses (expect essential services) and educational facilities closed. Moreover, a set of rules regarding personal movement were implemented, with people instructed to stay home, only associate with individuals they live with, and limit travel to their local area. Alert Level 3 immediately followed Alert Level 4, implemented between April 28 and May 3. Alert Level 3 allowed some businesses and educational facilities to open. However, social contact was still severely limited, with individuals only allowed to extend their social circle to close family they do not currently live with. To assess whether participants abided by New Zealand's lockdown rules, participants were asked to indicate from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) whether they abided by the five rules (e.g., \"I ensure I maintain the 2-meter rule when out in public\") ( Table 3) .",

The use of classical test theory, in which raw scores, linear combinations of these scores, and responses that are ordinal in scale, is considered as data on an interval scale. Rasch analysis is a statistical technique traditionally for binary data, but some polytomous generalizations can also be used for interval data . Standard Rasch analysis is based on unidimensional models. In unidimensional models, it is assumed that only one hidden feature of the individual determines the individual's performance in the scale. If the data do not fit well with the Rasch model, the unidimensional assumption is rejected. This means that more than one hidden feature has affected an individual's performance, so the feature cannot be assessed well using the scale in question .",

Item validity was assessed using information-weighted fit statistic (infit) mean square (MnSq), and outlier-sensitive fit statistic (outfit) MnSq with values between 0.5 and 1.5 considered acceptable. The presence of disordering threshold in the FCV-19S was assessed using average and step measures of the descriptors. A monotonic increase in difficulties between 0.5 and 1.5 suggests no disordering. The unidimensionality of the FCV-19S was examined by conducting principal component analysis of the residuals (PCAR) on the items. Explaining at least 50% of the variance in the Rasch dimension, and an eigenvalue of less than 2.0 on first contrast, provides evidence of unidimensionality (Linacre 2012) . The response pattern across subgroups of the population (age and gender groups) was assessed by differential item functioning (DIF). All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.0; R Core Team, 2019) using the LAVAAN (Rosseel 2012) and WINSTEPS 3.71 software (Linacre 2012) .",

The FCV-19S demonstrated good concurrent validity. More specifically, there was a moderately strong relationship between the FCV-19S and the two subscales of perceived vulnerability to disease scale: perceived infectability (Sample 1: r = 0.35, p < 0.001; Sample 2: r = 0.40, p < 0.001) and germ aversion (Sample 1: r = 0.39, p < 0.001; Sample 2: r = 0.45, p < 0.001). In addition, there was a negative relationship between FCV-19S and the WEMWBS (r = \u22120.31, p < 0.001), such that those who had higher fear scores reported lower overall wellbeing scores. Finally, when assessing participants' adherence to New Zealand's Lockdown Rules, FCV-19S was significantly associated with adherence with all five rules during Alert Level 4 (Sample 1) and three of the five rules during Alert Level 3 (Sample 2) (Table 4) .",

Mirroring the Bangla (Sakib et al. 2020) , Italian (Soraci et al. 2020) , Arabic (Alyami et al. 2020) , and Hebrew (Bitan et al. 2020) validation studies, participants tended to \"strongly disagree\" with items 3, 6, and 7. As Alyami (2020) note, items 3, 6, and 7 refer to somatic responses to COVID-19 fear (e.g., \"My heart races or palpitates when I think about getting coronavirus-19\"), rather than the more general level of fear tapped by the remaining items (e.g., \"When watching news and stories about coronavirus-19 on social media, I become nervous or anxious\"). Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the PVD scale (Duncan et al. 2009 ). Moreover, the FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the WEMWBS, reflecting the fact that as fear of COVID-19 increased wellbeing decreased. This finding is consistent with previous studies reporting positive correlations between the FCV-19S and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (Ahorsu et al. 2020; Alyami et al. 2020) , Patient Health Questionnaire (Sakib et al. 2020) , and the depression and anxiety stress scale (Bitan et al. 2020) . With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand (Harper et al. 2020; Pakpour and Griffiths 2020; Tannenbaum et al. 2015) . For example, fear of COVID-19 was associated with participants maintaining the 2-m rule (i.e., maintain 2-m distance from other people when out in public) and keeping physical activity to outdoor places that could be readily accessed by foot. This finding is consistent with Harper et al. (2020) , who reported a positive correlation between FCV-19S scores and participants judgment of the degree to which several behaviors and practices had changed due to the pandemic (e.g., hand washing, care of children, and the elderly).",
