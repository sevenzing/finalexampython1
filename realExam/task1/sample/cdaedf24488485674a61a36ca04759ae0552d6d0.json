However, we have shown that recovery of H influenzae, S pneumoniae, and M catarrhalis from nasopharyngeal swabs stored short-term in STGGB at \u221270\u00b0C is equivalent to direct plating of Amies swabs, 34 and these respiratory pathogens remain viable in frozen STGGB storage for at least 12 years. 35 Our finding of a statistically significant negative association between macrolide antibiotics and airway neutrophilic inflammation is consistent with a small Turkish randomized controlled trial, 27 which found that children receiving macrolides (compared to controls) had significantly reduced airway TCC, neutrophilia, and IL-8. Similar observations have been described in animal studies. 36 We also found a statistically significant reduction in lower airway bacterial load in children who received macrolide antibiotics. This reduction was not apparent in a smaller study of 104 Indigenous children with bronchiectasis. 37 However, macrolide antibiotics reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of respiratory bacterial pathogens in Indigenous children, 37, 38 and this was more pronounced when antibiotic use was frequent or long-term. 39 Indeed, a \"cumulative dose-response\" relationship was observed whereby increasing azithromycin exposure was associated with decreasing nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis. 40 Our findings (in this larger study of 655 children) of a statistically significant reduction in respiratory bacterial pathogen load in BAL samples from children exposed to macrolide antibiotics may be showing a similar effect in the lower airways to that seen in the upper airways.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 122, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 257, "end": 259, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 390, "end": 392, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 876, "end": 879, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 880, "end": 882, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1322, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1418, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1616, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1809, "end": 1811, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2044, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2167, "end": 2170, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 2171, "end": 2173, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2250, "end": 2252, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2462, "end": 2464, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In conclusion, our findings support a threshold of \u226510 4 CFU/mL BAL to define lower airway infection in children with PBB, CSLD, or bronchiectasis.

The median ages of the cohorts were similar, although subgroups within the cohorts differed in age and Indigenous status. In those with bronchiectasis, NT children were younger and mostly Indigenous compared to Qld children. The cohorts also differed in their recent antibiotic exposure; 52% of NT children had received macrolide antibiotics (mostly azithromycin) in the 2-weeks preceding bronchoscopy, compared to 7% of Qld children.
