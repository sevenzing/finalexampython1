NYS laboratories are eligible for (i) a permit for high or moderate complexity testing or (ii) registration as a Limited Service Laboratory (LSL) to perform waived tests that are simple and considered to have minimal risk of incorrect results or cause harm. Limited Service Laboratorys include nursing homes, school/student health services, dialysis facilities, ambulatory surgery centers, county health departments, correctional facilities, ambulance/rescue squads, and other direct patient care facilities. Physician Office Laboratories (POLs), operated by healthcare practitioners, only perform tests on specimens from their own patients and are exempt from the requirement to hold a CLEP permit.

Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System provides a mechanism for timely reporting, improves completeness and accuracy of reports, and facilitates the identification of emergent public health problems. Limiting the reportability of laboratory-confirmed influenza to clinical laboratories has ensured that the submitted test data have been performed under extensive QMSs, and provides tens of thousands of reports per season for extensive temporal and geographic coverage. During influenza season, the NYSDOH BCDC Influenza Surveillance Coordinator compiles a detailed weekly influenza report, which is posted online. This report includes geographic and demographic distribution of influenza cases; weekly and seasonal comparison of case numbers; testing and subtyping data from the WHO/NREVSS-collaborating laboratories in NYS; Wadsworth Center antiviral resistance data; numbers of healthcare facility-associated outbreaks; severity of disease; and any pediatric influenza-associated fatalities. 17 Challenges exist in communicating the reporting requirements to clinical laboratories testing NYS patients. The multiple laboratory classifications (permitted, LSL, POL) and different reporting requirements across diseases can create confusion. During peak influenza season, NYSDOH Statistical Unit staff must prioritize influenza data processing over other reportable diseases. Means of reporting of demographic data, LOINC \u00ae and SNOMED \u00ae coding, and test descriptions need to be standardized. The addition of codes for new strains, as they arise, improves the granularity and accuracy of reporting. Further, ECLRS reporting does not include the total number of specimens tested for denominator data. No other reportable communicable disease in NYS requires laboratories to report denominator data, which would be burdensome and might require a legislated regulatory change. Multiple networks in NYS contribute to influenza surveillance on the state level, but only some of those networks transmit data to the CDC for national surveillance. Wadsworth Center data together with NYS alternate data sources portray a clear picture of influenza in the community and give confidence to the surveillance of influenza viruses circulating at any time in each county or region. The NYS alternate data could enhance national influenza surveillance for situational awareness due to its volume, geographic representation within NYS, and reliability. During 2013-2014, NYS experienced a second wave of influenza activity, mostly type B, as intense and long lasting as the first wave of influenza A/H1pdm09 activity. Several other northeast states also experienced this second wave of activity, but most of the United States did not. NYS was the only state in the United States to report widespread activity to CDC for 24 consecutive weeks. Thus, the impact of the NYS alternate data is widespread, contributing to national and subsequently international influenza surveillance.This work was supported by the APHL and by Cooperative Agreement Number U60HM000803 from the CDC and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response.

They also thank Stephanie Chester, Sarah Muir-Paulik, and Kelly Wroblewski at the APHL for facilitating the influenza surveillance alternative data project, and Lynette Brammer, Stephanie Chester, and Stephanie Shulman (NYS CLEP Director) for review of the final manuscript. We sincerely appreciate the NYS Statistical Unit and Epidemiology staff for analyzing the NYS influenza surveillance data, and the participating clinical facilities whose data submissions contribute to the robust NYS influenza surveillance system.F I G U R E 5 Influenza testing performed during 2013-2014 by the Wadsworth Center, and NYS regional PHLs. Total number of positives are shown relative to the recommended Flu+ sample sizes determined from the Right Size Roadmap Calculator B for detection of a rare/novel event with 95% confidence and expected prevalence of 30% for high season (1/700 detection threshold), 10% for low season (1/200 detection threshold), and 1% for off-season (1/4 detection threshold). (The elevated specimen numbers for Wadsworth for weeks ending June 29, April 19, and May 10, are due to one EIP submitter sending backlogged specimens)", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
