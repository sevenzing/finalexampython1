Let M(A) = a > 0 (e.g., a = 0.2). Since [A, E] are contraries, we have M(E) = e \u2264 1 \u2212 a. Because the formulas [A, O] are contradictories, it follows from the definition of contradictories that M(\u0394 \u0394 \u0394A) = 0 and so M(\u0394 \u0394 \u0394O) = 1 because M(\u0394 \u0394 \u0394A) \u2297 M(\u0394 \u0394 \u0394O) = 0 and M(\u0394 \u0394 \u0394A) \u2295 M(\u0394 \u0394 \u0394O) = 1. Consequently, O is subaltern of E. The I is subaltern of A and thus M(I) = i \u2265 0.2. However, I is contradictory with E and so M(I) = i = 1. Finally, I is sub-contrary with O because M(O \u2207 \u2207 \u2207 I) = 1 and I is subaltern of A. (b) Construction of aeio as follows: Let us consider the same model M |= T IQ such that T IQ (\u2203x)\u00ac \u00ac \u00acAx. Let M(a) = a > 0 (e.g., a = 0.8), M(e) = e , M(i) = i and M(o) = o . Since [A, e], as well as [E, i] are contraries, we have M(e) = e \u2264 0.2 and M(a) = a \u2264 0.8. Similarly, formulas [i, O] and [I, o] are sub-contraries in T IQ then M(i) = i = 1 as well as M(i) = i = 1. Both of these results correspond with contradictories of the pairs [a, o] and [e, i]. Finally, A is subaltern of i as well as E is subaltern of o.",
