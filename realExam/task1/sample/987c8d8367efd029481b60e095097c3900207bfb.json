The unavailability of specific vaccines and anti-viral drug for nCoV, science demands sincere efforts in the field of drug design and discovery for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) play a crucial role during the disease propagation, and hence SARS-CoV-2 Mpro represents as a drug target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84). The structure files of Indian spices chemical compounds were taken from PubChem database or Zinc database and screened by molecular docking, by using AutoDock-4.2, MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon virtual screening tools. Top 04 hits based on their highest binding affinity were analyzed. Carnosol exhibited highest binding affinity -8.2 Kcal/mol and strong and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Arjunglucoside-I (-7.88 Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99 Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding affinity with favourable ADME properties. These compounds on MD simulations for 50 ns shows strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and remains stable inside the active site. Our virtual screening results suggest that these small chemical molecules can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and may have an anti-viral effect on nCoV. However, further validation and investigation of these inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease are needed to claim their candidacy for clinical trials.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "ARTICLE HISTORY", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since December 2019, a outbreak of COVID-19 with massive global impact has started in Hubei and Wuhan city in China caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (Bhoopathi et al., 2020; Kumar & Rathi, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . On January 2020, World health organization emergency committee declared a global health emergency based on the high rate of spreading of the infection with high fatality rate (Chhikara et al., 2020; Kumar & Rathi, 2020) . As of now on 4th April 2020, Europe and USA are new epicentres of Pandemic. Even in the past, different coronaviruses have caused multiple human diseases that resulted in global epidemics such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 . While the coronaviruses have a significant impact on human health, the general public has an inferior awareness of coronavirus pathogenesis and infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 as the worldwide human population is facing high risk from contracting the nCoV infection. Many countries, including India, has announced lockdown in the country and to maintain social distancing to avoid further spread as no drug or vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus has been classified into four subfamilies based on their shape and host. These subfamilies are alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta coronavirus (Paules et al., 2020) . Alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus are considered to have been originated from bats, while the gamma and delta coronaviruses are considered to be derived from birds and pigs (Banerjee et al., 2019) . Coronaviruses contain a positive sense, single-strand RNA genome coding for viral polymerase, RNA synthesis materials, and large nonstructural polypeptide. Coronavirus genome contains transcriptional modification, including 5'methylated cap and a 3'polyadenylated tail.

Upon further analysis of the docking results, it was seen that our molecules had comparable binding energy as to a-ketoamide suggesting that these ingredients could indeed interact with same site (amino acids) as a-ketoamide. Carnasol (-8.2 Kcal/mol) was seen to form hydrogen bonds with Leu141, Ser144 and Cys145. Hydrophobic interactions for Carnasol include His41, Thr25, Asn142, Phe140, Glu166, Met165 (Figure 1) .

MD simulation is performed for the total of 50 ns and the trajectories are for RMSD plot as shown in the The protein secondary structure is framed as 3 sheets, 7 beta hairpins, 9 beta bulges, 13 strands, 32 beta turns, 3 gamma turns from this 182-304 residues are occupied dominantly by loop regions. These 122 residues in the C-terminal functionally act in the MD simulation, and thus the sudden drift happens in the 45 th ns. This values of RMSD for the apo protein, is compared with ligand molecules in the Figure 3 , and for understanding the deviations, the 25 th to 50 th ns is focused. The results of ligand complex for the MD simulation of 50 ns of timescale shows that the ligand complex Alpha ketoamide (Red color) and Arjun glycoside (Blue color) shows stable throughout the simulation. While comparing these two Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex with apo protein, the ligand complex is matched with apo protein for the timescale of 45 th ns. After the 45 th ns the apo protein is drifted upwards, but the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex remains stable. This may be due to the strong interaction pattern seen in Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside interactions with the protein. Both the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand bound complex are stable and positioned in the range of $2\u00c5, which is close to the apo protein till 47 th ns. The Figures 5a and 5b shows the hydrogen bond interactions for the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside, which clearly shows the minimum participation of 2-3 hydrogen bonds seen in between the Alpha ketoamide and protein, and minimum participation of 4-6 hydrogen bonds between the Arjun glycoside and protein. This active participation of hydrogen bonds between the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside with protein makes the ligand complex stable for 50 ns of MD simulations. The ligand Carnosol shows stable movement in terms of RMSD values by showing a narrow graph, but while comparing with apo protein, the Carnosol ligand complex is deviated from the 14 th ns and stays in the range bound of $3.4 \u00c5 till the end of the simulations. For attaining the stable MD simulation for the Carnosol ligand bound complex, 2-3 hydrogen bonds are actively contributed and makes the complex stable in the dynamic state. The ligand Rosmanol bound complex shows stability till the 26 th ns with the range of $2.5 \u00c5, but after that, the drift happens to make the RMSD value deviated in upward direction and fix the positional RMSD with the range of $4 \u00c5. This may be due to the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions after the 27 th ns seen in the Figure 5d . Figure 5d says that the initial 27 ns shows the hydrogen bond interactions in the range of 2-3 between the protein and ligand, but after 27 th ns the ligand losses the hydrogen bonding ability and shows the hydrogen bond interactions in the range of 1-2 between the protein and ligand. Overall, the apo protein shows a narrow range of stability and notable fluctuations are also shown, that indicates the participation of loop structures. Those fluctuations are arrested through the active interactions of ligand molecules that shows strong binding between the protein and ligand.
