As new disease causing viruses are emerging rapidly, new alignment schemes with the advent of fast computers have gained its importance recently. In this paper, we have proposed a block based semi-global alignment scheme to evaluate the optimal alignment between any given two DNA sequences. DNA sequences are divided into blocks of equal length and alignment between the block is determined using dynamic programming. The performances are evaluated in terms of overall matrix score and percentage of similarity. It is inferred from the results, that higher the percentage of similarity between any two blocks, it may code for the same protein/amino acids. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is much less compared to that of the general global alignment scheme with O (M, N).",

Several work based on global alignment of sequences using dynamic programming were reported in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] where the computational complexity is directly related to the length product of two sequences. In [11] , authors proposed global alignment algorithm which involves inclusion of gaps and showed the improvement on computational efficiency. It has been shown in [10] that alignment involving only prefixes and suffixes of any given sequence improves the computational requirement. This scheme is referred as semiglobal alignment [10] .In this paper we have proposed a block based semi-global alignment scheme (BGA) to evaluate the optimal alignment between any given two DNA sequences. Two pairs of DNA sequences, plant species (Rhizobium sp) and disease causing virus (AIDS and SARS) are used for alignment of the sequences. The optimal block is identified based on two factors, namely, overall matrix score and similarity percentage between the DNA pair sequences.",

BLOCK BASED SEMI-GLOBAL ALIGNMENT SCHEME In BGA scheme, the pair DNA sequences are divided into several blocks of equal size and alignment is performed using dynamic programming as reported in [11] .The main objective of this scheme is to find the similarity between sequence with less computational time thereby the proteomic structure of the unknown DNA can be determined immediately. For the purpose of analysis, two types of DNA sequence, namely, plant species and disease causing virus are considered [11, 12] .Alignment is performed between DNA sequence of Agrobacterium radiobacter and between DNA sequence of Rhizobium sp. for histamine dehydrogenase (String 1 and String 2 respectively) and between DNA sequence of virus causing AIDS and DNA sequence of virus causing SARS (String 3 and String 4 respectively). Fig 1-4 The following notations as shown in Table 1 are used for DNA sequences of different block size. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of overall matrix score and percentage of similarity between the DNA pairs [10, 11] .The overall matrix score (F) is defined as [10] :",

It has been found that as the block size increases, overall matrix score tends to become more negative and hence results in less similarity between the strings. It has been further shown the computation time requires for implementing the algorithm seems to be less for small block sizes and further has to be tested with large databases for obtaining the optimization for alignment between the DNA sequence. It can be concluded that by using this BGA algorithm the structure and function of protein for the unknown sequence can be predicted with less computational time.",
