We read with great interest the paper written by Hongyan Zhang and Colleagues 1 , who firstly reported the treatment and outcome of a lung cancer patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) . A 57-years-old Chinese man affected by advanced lung adenocarcinoma harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L858R mutation continued targeted therapy with osimertinib despite the development of a COVID-antiviral therapy. As the authors admitted, patient continued osimertinib treatment because his overall situation permitted.",

First of all, both lung cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection can manifest heterogeneously, ranging from asymptomatic condition to severe respiratory distress requiring urgent treatment or intensive care. Furthermore, tumors harboring driver mutations such as EGFR treated with targeted therapy usually affect young and never smoker patients, but represent a minority of cases. More frequently, lung cancer patients are older people with a smoking habit and have no targetable mutations. Then, in most cases, treatments are chemotherapy, immunotherapy or combination strategies. Accumulating evidences suggest that the lung injury in COVID-19 is mainly due to an aberrant inflammation process mediated by a cytokine storm 3 . Interestingly, increasing levels of cytokines is considered a possible mechanisms underlying the immune-related events4, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been described as a rare complication of ICI treatments. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can also affect T cells and macrophages. So, it may cause an immunological dysregulation that might interfere with the response to immunotherapy. These processes could also motivate a possible overlap between COVID-19 pneumonia and immune-related pneumonitis. These two events have similar clinical and radiological features that make more difficult their differential diagnosis and management. Moreover, serious immune-related pneumonitis requires high-dose i.v. corticosteroids which have a controversial role in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia 5 .",
