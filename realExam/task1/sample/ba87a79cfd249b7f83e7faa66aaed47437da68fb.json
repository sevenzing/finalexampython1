The patient's clinician needs a cytology or tissue-based diagnosis describing the nature of the lesion and an interpretation of the data providing advice for an individual therapeutic strategy. The precedent for the shift in the pathological focus to the \"living patient\" was Virchow's cellular theory, dating from 1858: this inaugurated the change from the ancient Hippocratic body fluid \"humoral pathology\" to contemporary \"cellular pathology\" and provided explanations of several observations -then considered strange -such as inflammation, infection, or cancer at the light microscopic level (\"think microscopic\") [98] . It has taken more than a century to develop the microscopy and laboratory technology (tissue fixation, cutting, and staining) and the interpretation of tissue and cellular structure in terms of diagnostic features.",

Recent achievements in molecular biology and genetics using the nucleic acid amplification technique (polymerase chain reaction, PCR), combined with microscopic investigation such as in situ hybridization (FISH) and tissue microarray (TMA) processing [22, 27, 51, 78, 101] , provide a more detailed and \"time-related\" insight into the pathways of disease: we can now discern classic and prognosis-, risk-, and treatmentassociated diagnoses. The complexities of these new techniques in concert with modern information technology (IT) have had a great impact on current pathology practice and may well lead to a paradigm shift for the discipline, partly but not only due to this new methodology [1, 12, 65, 76, 79] .",

This tissue visualization technique, perfected over the years, \"fixes\" the spatial arrangement of a living biological system as tissue or organ morphology (architecture), which is the phenotypic expression of the genetic information coded in the DNA in the cell nucleus (= genotype). Using the H&E and special staining procedures, one can analyze the important biological structures in normal healthy tissues and their disturbance under conditions of abnormality (disease). Until now, particularly abnormal tissue growth could not be treated without knowledge of the tumor morphology [101] . If the analyzed features are smaller than the resolution limit of the light microscope (200 nm), the 1,000 times higher resolving power of electron microscope (EM) technology (0.2 nm) can provide ultrastructural data at the subcellular level to facilitate a diagnosis that might be uncertain by light microscopy [20, 28] . To assess the functional status of a lesion or abnormal growth, other techniques, for example, immunohistochemistry [101] , can visualize the expression of specific \"marker\" macromolecules, providing a simple \"yes-no\" presence or absence of a characteristic molecule, for example, breast cancer receptor protein or antigen.",

The objects usually display \"abnormal\" features (cancer or inflammatory cells, inclusions, and infectious agents), which are not present in the analyzed tissue under normal (healthy) conditions. Once detected, the specific object features allow, for example, a biological classification (cell type, bacterium, or virus) or identification of structural and functional units (glands, vessels, mitochondria, or filaments). In many samples, also the background and its context or texture can contain valuable information (grey values, basic pattern, and relations to the object) to help reach the right diagnosis. Because each pathologist has his/ her own algorithm for the image analysis and interpretation, in difficult cases it can happen that different pathologists can give different diagnostic statements (interpretations) on the same specimen [49, 101] .",

However, for regular distant expert consultations, live black-and-white images of skin and blood diseases were first transmitted from Logan Airport to the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston using a broadband telecommunication system in 1968. In 1985, Dr. R.S. Weinstein demonstrated the high diagnostic accuracy of video microscopy, while in 1986 he installed the first \"robotic\" light microscope for transmission of realtime images from El Paso/Texas to Washington DC via an SBS-3Comsat satellite [102, 103] . In 1989 in Europe, in the rural areas of Norway, two provincial hospitals, without their own pathologist, installed a robotic pathology diagnostic system (a telephone/video combination) and were linked to the University of Troms\u00f6 Pathology Department, providing them with intraoperative frozensection support. In February 1990, the first remote expert consultation was performed in Germany, between Darmstadt, Hannover, and Mainz [46, 102] . The rapid progress in digital sensor technique and digital image processing and increasing bandwidth of telecommunication links attracted increasing numbers of researchers and institutions to use this new technology for collaboration in science and health; the collected experience was shared at the first European Telepathology Conference in Heidelberg in 1992.",

            "text": "Today, one can speak of fourth-generation telepathology systems (=diagnostic pathology service at a distance, SNOMED definition), the technology having matured to the point where light microscopy telepathology has become a standard tool in a number of clinics and hospitals worldwide, and its applicability to and suitability for diagnostic routine use are well documented [46, 104, 105] . It includes a wide range of possible telepathology applications from remote gross (macroscopic) specimen description [55] , intraoperative frozen section service [6, 14, 15, 17, 43, 68, 106, 109] , request for a second opinion [21, 72, 91, 92, 103, 115] , and quality assurance in screening pathology [40, 47] to distance learning [2, 7, 46, 53, 73] , using commercial systems. They are working in a passive (store and forward) or active (real-time) telepathology mode. The passive systems acquire and digitize images from a microscope and transmit them to a remote site for a second opinion; the recipient has no control over the image sampling, magnification, and quality and must trust the transmitting participant to have selected an adequate area of specimen. The dynamic or real-time telepathology systems give the remote expert as much control over the image selection as the sender. By remote control of the microscope, the expert can get an overview of the specimen at low magnification, select the relevant areas of interest, and choose the appropriate magnification to render a diagnosis. In this new millennium, an automated procedure has been described [19] , capable of managing a robotic microscope and rapid image acquisition for the construction of a \"virtual case\": this consists of a \"stitched-up\" collection of digital images (\"tiles\") from a histological/cytological slide at all magnification levels together with all relevant clinical data. This \"digital slide\" can be viewed on a computer using a user-friendly interface (\"digital microscope\") and used for multiple purposes independent of time and space with respect to the observer. To reduce the time necessary for scanning the original glass slide, this trend culminated in the development of a miniaturized light microscope array (MMA), allowing ultrarapid virtual slide processing [37, 49, 105 ].",

On the one hand, this may be due to the general decline of the use of EM in recent decades due to major advances in immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques (in situ hybridization, PCR). On the other hand, in addition to applications in research, the diagnostic value of EM in surgical pathology [29, 30, 95] in such areas as renal, muscle, nervous system, skin, ciliary defects, storage diseases, opportunistic infections, and rapid viral diagnosis is good [20, 28, 31, 35, 70] . Diagnostic EM possesses an approximately 100 times higher resolution as light microscopy, and so it visualizes structures not recognizable by light microscopy examination. In combination with rapid microwave-assisted tissue preparation procedures [25, 50, 84] , it can deliver specific and exact findings on the same day as sampling and make therapeutic decisions that are much easier. It is important to realize that the ultrastructural examination of neoplasms, especially addressing diagnostic difficulties by light microscopy, is a complementary approach with other techniques such as immunohistochemistry [32, 42, 69] and can be a very valuable adjunct to diagnostic assessment (including samples retrieved from tissues previously embedded in paraffin).",

An analogoperated EM with a traditional photographic plate camera is not suitable for remote control and effective networking. This situation is slowly changing, because now (often for economic reasons) centralized EM units, equipped with modern digitally controlled EMs and digital image acquisition, are being established in life-science centers and clinics. Another point is the lack of automation and rationalization of the sample preparation and embedding methods. The implementation of microprocessor-controlled tissue processors and use of microwave-assisted procedures are considerably reducing sample turnaround times (from 3-4 days to a matter of hours); in short, \"same day\" diagnoses are becoming a clinical reality [84] .",

Another challenge is the different modes in which samples are examined in light microscopy and EM, the latter having an inherent and considerable magnification range.

In our opinion, the value and usefulness of ultrastructural examinations could be increased greatly by establishing a worldwide consultation network of experts or \"national centers of excellence\" to assist in obtaining and interpreting ultrastructural data of complex cases in real time. What is almost a consultation routine for light microscopy histopathologists (in specialized telediagnosis centers such as AFIP [108] ; UICC, Berlin [21] ; iPATH, Basel [8] ; and WWM, Japan [66] ) would be equally useful for ultrastructural pathology. The two main benefits would be time savings in \"live\" examination of the original specimen by remote experts and avoiding difficulties inherent in the interpretation of either photographic prints (\"snail posting\") or a still image collection (e-mail attachments), possibly captured from inadequate areas of the tissue in question. A significant advantage specifically of worldwide consultation networks for ultrastructural telepathology would be that expensive instrumentation would become available for remote experts or users [93] . This may be extremely useful in case of an unknown or epidemic viral outbreak (such as SARS, avian flu, and norovirus) as well as in potential bioterror scenarios [36, 41, 57, 62, 63 ].",

This digitally controlled EFTEM (LEO/Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) provides an in-column integrated energy filter, operates at 80-120 kV and is an optimal instrument for biological and diagnostic sample examination. At this time, it was equipped with a bottom-mounted 1,024 \u00d7 1,024 pixel CCD slowscan camera (TRS \u00ae /Moorenweis, Germany) for image acquisition. The system was controlled by a Windows NT server and acquired the images from the camera by a frame grabber. The commercial software \"analySIS \u00ae \" (EsiVision \u00ae Ver. 3.1, SIS/Muenster) was expanded with a dedicated TelePresence server module that controlled the microscope and handled the communication with the remote computer. At the \"client site\" in Bochum, a laptop equipped with an ISDN-PCMCIA card provided direct access to the Internet (a client \"analy-SIS \u00ae \" software was installed on the laptop computer). A video beamer with a resolution of 1,024 \u00d7 768 pixels displayed the remote examination of a (routinely prepared) skin biopsy section from a CADASIL patient to the audience (CADASIL is a central nervous system disease with ischemic stroke; the definitive diagnosis is rendered by EM evidence of specific, very small deposits in the wall of skin vessels) (Fig. 14.3) .

Simple mouse clicks on the buttons visible in the EM-control panel allowed the magnification, beam blanker (on/off), illumination adjustment, control of the stage navigation, and coarse/fine focus adjustment experience the live remote operation of the EM in Regensburg but also learn interactively how to make the diagnosis of this peculiar disease.",

NFD (also termed NSF, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis) is a painful and disabling recently documented disease observed mainly in patients with renal insufficiency (dialysis or kidney transplant patients) with a previous gadolinium exposure, the etiology of the disease being so far elusive [90] . Gadolinium is a rare-earth element and, owing to its paramagnetic properties, it is widely used as a relatively safe contrast agent in clinical magnetic resonance imaging. The patient concerned had been dialysis-dependent and also had a history of gadolinium exposure; the light microscopy skin histopathology was suggestive for NFD, but other differential diagnoses like autoimmune disorders (such as scleroderma) had to be considered. In the deparaffinized skin sample, we found some tiny perivascular aggregates of undefined material and performed a telepathology \"second-opinion\" consultation with a skin pathology expert in Heidelberg to exclude possible artifactual findings. The direct telepathologic examination of the sections (choosing different section areas and magnifications) by the expert resulted in an instant confirmation of possible real deposits of inorganic material (Fig. 14.8 ). This immediately prompted us to perform an in situ elemental analysis using the ESI (electron spectroscopic imaging) and EELS (electron energy loss spectroscopy) methodology with our EFTEM to clear the nature of the deposits in question. This had a considerable impact for the patient's further treatment and is probably also important for the etiologic understanding of the disease [85] .",

Depending on the individual need of the user, a range of high-resolution and fast, bottom-or side-entry CCD cameras can be chosen, but, currently for telemicroscopy settings, it is advisable to keep the pixel number of the transferred images as small as possible (camera pixel binning is a helpful adjunct).

This \"distributed or parallel computing\" uses the Internet as a communication layer and allows access to geographically widespread and sometimes unique resources -for example, dedicated light and electron microscopes, computing performance, information in databases, and services, respecting the rules of the economy of scale (which, e.g., determinate the relation between the size of a plant and the production costs). Different Grids are already established, for example, the Telescience Project at the NCMIR, San Diego, CA, for life science and microscopy [94] and the PRAGMA (Pacific Rim and Grid Middleware Assembly) [74] ; the trend may culminate in the development of virtual institutions [48] .",

Telemedicine in concert with eScience and eHealth solutions has the potential to offer an efficient health service to everybody independently of geographical location and social status [112] . In trust of this knowledge and vision, we have to work in our subdiscipline of ultrastructural telepathology to establish practical solutions to manage the requirements of modern health-care systems for time and cost reduction [9, 18, 49] while maintaining the highest diagnostic standards. The telepathology motto, \"move the image, not the patient, \" will help to direct us to achieve these objectives.",

Remote experts can examine samples directly with adequate EM functionality, and, in case of diagnostic dilemmas, the consulting \"second-opinion\" expert is no longer constrained by problems inherent in preselected images.",
