Looking at the status of different countries, one can cluster them into three main categories. Some nations have limited exposure to geriatric psychiatry, such as Algeria, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. For instance, Sudan has no geriatricians or geriatric mental health clinics; most of the limited psychiatric services are restricted to the capital and major cities. Similarly, in Syria, geriatric medicine remains a foreign discipline taught along with the endocrinology and nutritional disorders module of medical schools. Other nations have some resources for geriatric medicine, but minimally available expertise. These include Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, KSA, and Tunisia. Jordan and Lebanon each have less than ten geriatricians and Lebanon recently acquired its first geriatric psychiatrist. In Morocco, geriatrics became a field of study for medical school graduates a few years ago and geriatric psychiatry is currently part of the curriculum of trainees. Oman is starting to witness a rise in the field, with newly established geriatric psychiatry clinics in two tertiary hospitals, run by five geriatric psychiatrists. The Oman Al Zahimer Association for dementia has also been providing support for patients with dementia and their caregivers throughout the country. In comparison, while there are no clinics dedicated to psychogeriatrics in Tunisia, except for some specialized units in dementia, a university diploma and a research unit exist at the faculty of medicine of Monastir in the center of the country. Geriatric psychiatry services also remain limited in the UAE. Lastly, very few nations have developed extensive resources and services allocated to geriatric psychiatry. In Egypt, most of the psychiatry departments already have or are currently establishing their psychogeriatric section with outpatient clinics and memory clinics. Geriatric psychiatry is currently one of the requirements in many of those training programs. The Egyptian Alzheimer Society has been leading the field and spreading awareness for years now. Alternatively, geriatric psychiatric services in Qatar are provided through different models, including outpatient clinics, specialized memory clinics, consultations on the medical floors of general hospitals, and via residential and home visits for people who cannot reach out. The service has been growing significantly in recent years, particularly following the launching of Qatar National Dementia Plan 2018-2022 and plans for 'Healthy Ageing' in the country 30, 31 .

Second, self-isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak can severely affect older adults, whose only social contact is out-of-the home, such as at community centers and places of worship. Also, increasing numbers of the elderly in the low-and middle-income countries are being cared for in nursing homes, which often are unregulated and have limited services 62 . Those who attend nursing homes and lost face-to-face contact with their family members, those who do not have spouses, family, or friends, and those who rely on the support of voluntary services or social care, are all equally affected 63, 64 . Since many healthcare systems of the MENA region face severe limitations and are unlikely able to provide the needed care for all COVID-19 patients, a disproportionate number of those are expected to be older. Further marginalization of the geriatric population would ensue 11 .
