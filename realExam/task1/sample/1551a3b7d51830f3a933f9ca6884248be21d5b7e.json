            "text": "Rhodococcus equi (previously known as Corynebacterium equi) is an intracellular pathogen that establishes itself in macrophages by interfering with phagolysosomal fusion (Heitala and Ardans 1987) . This interference eventually results in the multiplication of the pathogen within the macrophages, which leads to the formation of granulomas and, eventually, necrosis. The aerobic Grampositive pleomorphic organisms of R equi vary from cocci to rods and are commonly found in the faeces of foals and in soil contaminated by other herbivore faeces. The organism has also been isolated from rabbit and bird droppings, but not from cat faeces (Carman and Hodges 1987) .",

The laboratory involved in the bacterial culture was alerted to the possibility that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, such as R equi, Norcardia asteroides, Arcanobacterium species and Actinobacillus species, could be present. The technique of culturing organisms from a tissue specimen involves crushing the material to release the intracellular organisms. In this case, the technique produced a pure culture of R equi, which was then easy to identify using routine biochemical tests for the species.",

However, fungal spores and bacteria can be differentiated from each other by their size on microscopic examination.",

Seven survived, so the prognosis seems to be reasonably favourable when there is no systemic infection present. In the most recent report, five out of six cats with lesions involving distal extremities recovered after antibacterial treatment, whereas one with a suspected infection of the lungs died (Fairley and Fairley 1999) . Elliott and others (1986) suggested that it might be possible to transfer the organism from one animal to another via a fomite. Therefore, the various attempts to remove infected tissue by wide margin excision by the referring veterinary surgeon may have failed due to the spread of infection during surgery, or because it may already have spread via the lymphatic system. It is postulated that in the present case the organism probably spread via the latter route, because following the initial infection on the right side of the neck, the right submandibular lymph node and parotid gland became involved, and because the clinical signs bore close resemblance to those of ulcerative lymphangitis seen in horses, pigs and ruminants.",

Based on these results, doxycyline was prescribed. A previous attempt at treatment with enrofloxacin had shown a poor response. Tetracyclines act by inhibiting protein synthesis through binding to the 30-S ribosomal subunit, which prevents the transfer RNA from binding to its receptor site on the ribosome (Papich 1995) . Doxycyline is lipid-soluble, which gives it the ability to achieve good intracellular penetration, and it has been advocated as a secondline treatment for other intracellular pathogens, such as opportunistic mycobacterial infections (Gunn-Moore and Shaw 1997). The cat in the present report may not have responded to doxycycline because of the extensive spread of the organism, even though in vitro sensitivity had been demonstrated.",

In vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that this ability is correlated with the presence of a virulence-associated plasmid, which allows bacterial multiplication within the macrophage and granuloma formation (Hondalus 1997) . This virulence-associated plasmid has been found consistently in R equi isolates from clinically affected foals, but not from clinically affected humans, suggesting that the patient's immunodeficiency status allows the less virulent strains to persist within the macrophages......",
