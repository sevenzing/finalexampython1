            "text": "Total laryngectomy, which results in an interruption between the upper airway and trachea with complete respiratory dependence through a tracheostoma, represents a unique challenge for patient management in the setting of COVID-19. Laryngectomy patients are at risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19 due to frequently present medical comorbidities including chronic pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, the underlying cancer history, and a propensity for atelectasis due to loss of upper airway resistance. 7 Furthermore, as the majority of laryngectomy patients have a smoking history, they are also prone to acute infections due to impaired mucociliary function and mucosal irritation from cold, dry inspired air. 7 In addition, salvage total laryngectomy can result in postoperative wound complications and prolonged hospital stays and greater risk of exposure to the virus as hospitals are inundated with COVID-19 patients. If infected, laryngectomy patients carry a high risk of transmitting viral particles to health care workers or members of the community due to their significantly altered anatomy and to aerosolization of tracheal secretions. 8, 9 2 | INFECTION CONTROL PRECAUTIONS IN TOTAL LARYNGECTOMY PATIENTS Direct examination and instrumenting the head and neck region during physical examination of the infected patient represents a significant transmission hazard for the physician and ancillary support staff due to the high viral load present in the upper aerodigestive tract. 4 Unfortunately, many patients are asymptomatic early in infection, and some patients may remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. Currently, COVID-19 testing is limited by access to supplies and lengthy turnaround times, and therefore, patients with unknown COVID-19 testing should be presumed positive until testing becomes readily available with rapid results.",

            "text": "The best approach for testing laryngectomy patients for COVID-19 also requires consideration. COVID-19 testing is most commonly performed via nasopharyngeal swab. Although laryngectomy patients have no significant airflow through the nasal cavity or nasopharynx, they can still develop sinonasal disease. 10 However, as the primary respiratory flow is via the tracheostoma, the trachea and lungs may serve as an additional site of direct inoculation. Therefore, it is important to consider testing for SARS-CoV-2 in tracheal aspirates as well as in the nasal passages for laryngectomy patients. This is consistent with CDC recommendations of lower respiratory track specimens if available. 11 Any manipulation of the upper aerodigestive tract that precipitates cough, including endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and pharynx must be treated as an aerosol-generating procedure that has a high risk of virus transmission. To limit COVID-19 transmission and preserve medical resources including personal protective equipment (PPE), the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) have recommended otolaryngologic procedures be deferred unless the procedure is medically necessary in a high acuity. 12, 13 Given the extensive alterations in anatomy, their cancer history, and risk of airway complications related to tracheoesophageal fistulae (TEF) or tracheoesophageal prostheses (TEP), laryngectomy patients may still require acute face to face encounters. As such, special considerations to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission should be undertaken. The proper use of PPE is important in the setting of COVID-19. In these patients, unconditioned air enters the tracheostoma, which can lead to increased coughing. 3 Inherently, tracheostomas generate a greater aerosol load in comparison to normal respiration through the upper airway. 9 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, viral RNA was detected in high concentrations in tracheal aspiration samples, indicating the virus also replicates in tracheal secretions. 14 With this in mind, extra care must be taken to protect against aerosolized particles generated when examining and interacting with laryngectomy patients in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.",

Standard PPE, as defined by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), can be used for COVID-19-negative patients. 15 Proper PPE compliance is critical in maintaining its efficacy and the appropriate sequence of donning and doffing of the equipment is vital. 11 It is important to note, however, that the use of an N95 respirator and face shield may not be 100% effective at preventing COVID-19 transmission. In fact, two recent meta-analyses failed to demonstrate the superiority of N95 respirators over standard surgical masks in preventing influenza. 16, 17 Due to the increased protection afforded and possible reusability, a PAPR is preferred over an N95 respirator and face shield for high-risk procedures, when available, so long as there is appropriate physician comfort and training with a PAPR. 4, 18, 19 The availability of PAPR can vary greatly from center to center.

The federal government has taken steps to greatly expand telemedicine services under Medicare and Medicaid with HIPAA flexibilities and this was made retroactive to January 27, 2020. 20 When in-office visits are absolutely necessary (eg, postoperative visits, tracheoesophageal prosthesis (TEP) complications, symptoms concerning for cancer recurrence, etc.), screening prior to the visit for symptoms of COVID-19 and self-quarantine measures may help reduce transmission risks. An example of pre-arrival instructions for patients are listed in Table 1 . To minimize aerosolized particle spread from a laryngectomy patient, the tracheostoma should be covered with a heat moisture exchanger (HME), preferably with an integrated viral/bacterial hydroscopic filter, and a physical barrier over the stoma such as a surgical mask, scarf, or shirt, prior to their arrival to the clinic. 21, 22 Two major manufacturers (Atos, InHealth) produce an HME with these filters: Atos Provox Micron HME filters virus and bacterial particles (https://www.atosmedical.com/ product/provox-micron-hme/), and the InHealth Technologies Blom-Singer HME filters bacterial particles (https:// www.inhealth.com/category_s/47.htm). In addition laryngectomy patients should, where feasible, be encouraged to use adhesive base plates such as the Provox StabiliBase (https://www.atosmedical.com/product/provox-stabilibase/) or the Blom-Singer TruSeal Adhesive Housing (https:// www.inhealth.com/product_p/truseal_standard.htm). These incorporate the HME and when properly applied will prevent airflow outside of the HME, and reduce mucous contamination of clothing or other physical barriers.",

Typically, these complications can be managed in the office using standard PPE. However, due to the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2, the standard management and timing to address these complications is subject to change. Optimally, a negative pressure room and HEPA filtration can minimize the risk of viral transmission, and should be considered in the COVID-19 era. 25 However, this is not necessarily practical from a health care resource utilization and workflow standpoint. Figure 1 presents a possible decision algorithm in managing TEP complications including dislodgement of the prosthesis and leak around the prosthesis. A patient with a TEF or leak around a TEP is at an increased risk of aspiration with potential sequelae including pneumonia, which could lead to devastating outcomes if patients contract COVID-19. In the event of a dislodged TEP, radiographic imaging can serve as a diagnostic tool to replace flexible bronchoscopy or tracheoscopy in evaluating for an airway foreign body. This can begin with standard X-rays of the chest and abdomen but may be augmented with CT imaging. 26 Certainly, if the patient is in respiratory distress from an aspirated TEP, urgent surgical intervention is indicated regardless of COVID-19 status.

Due to the increased aerosolization risk, the potential to become \"super spreaders\" necessitates that total laryngectomy patients always cover their stoma in public. As previously mentioned, the best protection against aerosolization and inhalation of viral particles in the community is to cover the stoma with an HME that includes a bacterial and/or viral filter. Many patients prefer to use laryngectomy tubes, but during this pandemic an HME attached to the stoma with a baseplate allows for a seal that will force all air through the HME, thus further minimizing aerosolization. If the patient is unable to obtain a good seal with the HME base plate, they can use laryngectomy tubes that accept HME filters.

An N95 respirator over the stoma would likely be of limited value as compared to those alternate options given the inability to create an appropriate seal around the stoma. Covering the mouth and nose are also important as these sites remain a potential vector of viral inoculation. The landscape surrounding COVID-19 is rapidly changing, and guidelines will continue to evolve, however, at this time general recommendations are for laryngectomy patients to wear a face mask in addition to an HME with viral filter and additional stomal covering with a surgical mask or other garment.",

At this time, it is critical to postpone all non-urgent patient interactions in the clinic setting and to develop new outpatient clinic workflow procedures to reduce aerosol particle transmission. In this patient cohort, when testing for SARS-CoV-2, it is important to include testing for the presence of the virus in tracheal aspirates as well as in the nasal passages. We recommend that until SARS-CoV-2 testing becomes more widely available, the same precautions used for COVID-19 positive patients should be implemented for laryngectomy patients with the use of enhanced PPE for all head and neck exams. Procedures such as TEP replacement, non-critical nasal endoscopy, or nasopharyngoscopy should be delayed when possible and patients should be counseled on appropriate temporizing measures that can be taken. If intervention is required, all efforts to lower clinical suspicion for COVID-19 infection should be taken with rapid testing, if available, and appropriate quarantine prior to any procedures. The use of HMEs and covers over the stoma can help limit exposure and transmission risk related to this patient population.",
