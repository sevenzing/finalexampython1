Influenza is a disease caused by the influenza virus, an RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae [3] . Many features are common with those of the paramyxovirus infections of the acute upper respiratory tract. Typical symptoms of the disease are characterized by fever, myalgia, severe malaise, non-productive cough, and sore throats. The disease spreads when an infected individual coughs or sneezes and sends the virus into the air, and other susceptible individuals inhale the virus. The virus is also believed to be transmitted when a person touches a surface that is contaminated with the virus (e.g. door knob, etc.) and then touches the nose or eyes. Infected individuals can transmit the virus almost within a day following infection (i.e. latent period). Although it is generally believed that infected individuals can pass the virus for 3-7 days following symptom onset, there is some uncertainty on the duration of the infectious period. The generation time (i.e. sum of latent and infectious periods) for influenza, reported and assumed in the literature, ranges from 3 days [4] [5] [6] to about 6 days [7] [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 134, "end": 137, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 241, "end": 244, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1233, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1241, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1261, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1265, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Individuals that are infected with influenza are believed to become permanently immune against the specific virus strain.

Theoretically, R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population [17] . As the epidemic progresses, the number of susceptible individuals is decreased due to infection, and the reproduction number decays following R(t) = R 0 S(t)/S(0) where S(t) and S(0) are, respectively, the number of susceptible individuals at time t and before the epidemic starts; the latter is equivalent to the total population size N given that all individuals are susceptible before the beginning of an epidemic. Clearly, this definition only applies to (novel) emerging infectious diseases (e.g. the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from 2002-3) or re-emerging infectious diseases that had not circulated in the population in question for long enough to allow for residual immunity in the population to disappear due to births and deaths.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 329, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "On the definition of the transmission potential"}, {"text": "The reproduction number is directly related to the type and intensity of interventions necessary to control an epidemic since the objective is to make R(t) < 1 as soon as possible.

That is, when vaccine is available against a disease in question, it is of interest to estimate the critical proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated (i.e. vaccination coverage) in order to attain R < 1 [18] [19] .

Explanation of the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at time t (for t > 0) [41][42][44][81][82] 1 . Although effective interventions against Spanish influenza may have been limited in the early 20th century, it is plausible that the contact frequency leading to infection varied with time owing to the huge number of deaths and dissemination of information through local media (e.g. newspapers). R(t) shows time-dependent variation with a decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and with the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors).

Further elaborations andTo estimate the basic reproduction number of endemic diseases, different approaches are taken. One would need first to carry out serological surveys to quantify the fraction of the population that is effectively protected against infection (i.e. age-and/or time-specific proportion of those possessing acquired immunity needs to be estimated).Through this effort, the force of infection, the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected, is estimated[45]. For example, this is the case for rubella, mumps and measles (that are still circulating in some regions of the world even when high effective vaccination coverage is achieved).

Let us denote the numbers of susceptible and recovered individuals by S(t) and U(t).

The issue of assuming explicit distributions for latent and infectious periods has been highlighted in recent studies [86][87][88][89],[90] and indeed, this point is in part addressed by (34), because the convolution of latent and infectious periods yields w(\u03c4 ).

To explicitly test if superspreading events frequently exist in influenza transmission, it is necessary to accumulate contact tracing data for this difficult disease, the cases of which often show flu-like symptoms only (as discussed in Section 1). In addition, it should be noted that we cannot attribute the skewed offspring distribution to the underlying contact network only. To date, there are two major reasons which can generate superspreaders: (i) those who experience very frequent contacts (social superspreader) or (ii) those who are suffering from high pathogen loads or those who can scatter the pathogen through the air such as the use of nebuliser", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF7": {"text": "our arguments, almost necessarily, employed homogeneous mixing assumption, as we cannot extract information on heterogeneous patterns of infection from a single stream of temporal data alone. Presently, more information (e.g. at least, spatio-temporal distribution) is becoming available for influenza. In this section, we briefly sketch what can be (and should be) done in the future to quantify the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza.It's not a new issue that heterogeneous patterns of transmission could even destroy the mean field theory in infectious diseases. For example, in a pioneering study of gonorrhea transmission dynamics by Hethcote and Yorke[147], an importance of contact heterogeneity was sufficiently highlighted. Since a simple model assuming homogeneous mixing did not reflect the patterns of gonorrhea transmission in the United States, Hethcote and Yorke divided the population in question into two; those who are sexually very active and not, the former of which was referred to as core group. Compared with the temporal distribution of infection given by a model with homogeneous mixing assumption, the simple heterogeneous model with a core group revealed much quicker increase in epidemic size, showing rather different trajectory of an epidemic. Given that the variance of sexual partnership is extremely large (i.e. if the distribution of the frequency of sexual intercourse is extremely skewed to the right with a very long right tail), the estimate of R 0 is shown to become considerably high. The finding supports a vulnerability of our society to the invasion of sexually transmitted diseases.Following this pioneering study, considerable efforts have been made to approximately model the heterogeneous patterns of transmission using extended mean field equations[18][26][148][149].", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "However, it should be noted that the pattern of contact does not necessarily follow scale-free for all directly transmitted diseases. Indeed, there is no empirical evidence which suggests that the contact structure of any droplet infections follows the power law (i.e. we do not know if the above described contact heterogeneity is the case for diseases except for sexually transmitted diseases). A typical example of confusion is seen in the superspreading events during the 2002-03 SARS epidemics[158], where we cannot explicitly attribute the phenomena either to contact network or biological factors (as long as contact and infection event are not directly observable).
