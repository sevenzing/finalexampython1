Ford (1999) reviewed the available data on the incidence of waterborne diseases globally and for the United States. He noted that the reported incidence of these diseases only begin to estimate the global impact since most waterborne diseases are underreported. In addition, he noted the need for additional research on the distribution and survival strategies of pathogens within treatment and distributions systems in order to control disease outbreaks. Wu et al. (1999) noted that approximately 700 million people in China consume fecally contaminated drinking water. They found that the widespread, and increasing water pollution, in that country was the result of critical deficits in basic infrastructure and a lack of administrative coordination between environmental, public health, and economic factors. Gofti et al. (1999) reviewed the application of risk assessment and risk management principles to the control of waterborne diseases. The authors suggested that these techniques, first applied to chemical pollutants in the 1970s, allow for the control of disease outbreaks in a cost-effective manner.",

They stressed the urgent need to develop adequate water and wastewater treatment facilities to assure adequate public health. Kravitz et al. (1999) reported on the results of an examination of domestic water supplies for microbial contamination in the Lesotho Highlands. A total of 72 village water sources were classified as unimproved (n = 23), semi-improved (n = 37), or improved (n =2). Based on the estimation of total coliforms, all unimproved and semi-improved water sources would be considered as not potable. Escherichia coli was absent (P < 0.001) in most of the improved water sources. Among 588 queried households, only 38% had access to an \"improved\" water supply. The findings support the WHO drinking water from office water dispensers, Hunter et al.

While current methods to monitor and treat water and wastewater have resulted in dramatic declines in the incidence of such waterborne diseases as cholera and typhoid fever, the organisms causing these diseases still pose a major threat to human health and well-being. Globally, diarrheal diseases, usually transmitted by contaminated food or water, are among the leading causes of infant and child mortality. In addition, emerging waterborne diseases, such as cryptosporidiosis, have emphasized the importance of providing microbiologically safe water to the consumer. In this paper, we review recent information on both indicator organisms and pathogens in the water environment. The focus of this review is on the detection and occurrence of these organisms.",

(1999) reported on an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a village of 700 residents traced to a private water supply and argued that the regulatory framework for such supplies should be modified to ensure safer design and operation. Investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (1999) summarized the outbreak of E. coli O157: H7 and Campylobacter jejuni that occurred in September 1999 at the New York State Fair. Contaminated well water was implicated as the source for this outbreak. Based on the results of a survey of the microbiological quality of investigated the relationship between agricultural land-use within a small upland catchment in north Derbyshire, England and concentrations of indicator organisms (fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci). During its passage through the catchment, the stream became significantly contaminated by fecal bacteria, suggesting the existence of a semipermanent store of fecal bacteria in catchment soils, combined with hydrological transport mechanisms capable of moving bacteria from the land to the stream channel. A clear and consistent relationship between the bacterial quality of catchment waters and the intensity of adjacent agricultural land-use was not apparent indicating that multiple factors control the concentration of indicator organisms. Brion and Lingireddy (1999) used fecal bacteria concentrations in water and rainfall data as inputs for training a neural network model to distinguish between urban and agricultural fecal contamination present in inputs to a drinking water reservoir. The average concentrations of microorganisms measured were highly variable and analysis of FC/FS ratios was not able to differentiate between urban or agriculturally impacted sites while the use of the neural network model allowed for differentiation of these sites.",

HS and NHS isolates showed 41 and 61 RT profiles, respectively. Discriminant analysis of RT profiles proved to be a useful method for identifying HS and NHS fecal pollution potentially facilitating management practices. Patterns of antibiotic resistance in fecal streptococci were analyzed by discriminant and cluster analysis and used to identify sources of fecal pollution in a rural Virginia watershed (Hagedorn et al., 1999) . Comparison of 892 known-source isolates from a test watershed against the database of organisms of known source resulted in an average correct classification rate of 88%. Combining all animal isolates increased correct classification rates to > or = to 95% for separations between animal and human sources. These results demonstrated that antibiotic resistance profiles in fecal streptococci can be used to reliably determine sources of fecal pollution, and water quality improvements can occur when efforts to address the identified sources are made.",

Gull feces contained a greater average concentration of fecal coliform bacteria per Gram than goose feces; however, average fecal sample weights of the geese were more than 15 times higher than those of the gulls.

When the incidence of resistance to a number of antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, naladixic acid, neomycin, and streptomycin) in native heterotrophic bacteria and E. coli isolates along a range of sites on the Yarra River in southeastern Australia was examined, E. coli from rural sites were found to have a lower incidence of resistance than isolates from urban sites (Boon and Cattanach, 1999) . This may indicate that antibiotic resistance can be used as an indicator of bacteriological water quality. Wiggins et al. (1999) conducted a study to determine the reliability and repeatability of antibiotic resistance analysis as a method of identifying the sources of fecal pollution in surface water and groundwater. Four large sets of isolates of fecal streptococci (from 2,635 to 5,990 isolates per set) were obtained from 236 samples of human sewage and septage, cattle and poultry feces, and pristine waters. Their data indicated that there are measurable and consistent differences in the antibiotic resistance patterns of fecal streptococci isolated from various sources of fecal pollution and that antibiotic resistance analysis can be used to classify and identify these sources.",

Using these compounds as markers, they were able to demonstrate the o of sewage input into the system. in situ survival experiments performed in river water, whereas the numbers of phages decreased between 1 and 2 log units. Chlorination and pasteurization treatments that reduced the numbers of bacteria by approximately 4 log units reduced the numbers of bacteriophages by less than 1 log unit. Sata et al. (1999) examined the influence of starvation on the culturability of E. coli O157:H7 in selective and nonselective media. Their results indicated that the isolation of staved cells would be extremely difficult with direct culture on selective media and recommended the inclusion of a resuscitation step in non-selective media to improve recovery of the organism from water samples. Rajiowski et al. (1999) also found improved recovery of VTEC from spiked samples of reconditioned wastewater from a pork-processing plant when the samples were plated onto non-selective rather than selective media. Pyle et al. (1999) described a rapid direct method to enumerate active E. coli O157:H7 in food and water samples. The method which combines immunomagnetic separation to concentrate the cells with specific fluorescent antibody staining and activity determination using cyanoditolyl tetrazolium chloride reduction allowed for the direct microscopic enumeration of the organism. Studies using spiked samples indicated that enumeration using this method was comparable to enumeration using cultural methods in a significantly shorter period of time (5-7 h.). Kurokawa et al. (1999) compared direct in situ PCR with HNPP/Fast Red TR to direct fluorescent antibody staining for the detection of VTEC in river water. Their results indicated that the two methods gave similar counts of organisms and therefore concluded that direct in situ PCR is a useful tool for detecting cells carrying specific genes in natural environments.",

While the well water was not used directly for drinking, it was used to wash raw vegetables before consumption. The electrophoretic mobilities (EPMs), an indicator of the transport of organisms in groundwater, of a number of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and wild-type E. coli strains were measured (Lytle et al., 1999b) . The effects of pH and ionic strength on the EPMs were investigated. The EPMs of E. coli O157:H7 strains differed from those of wild-type strains. As the suspension pH decreased, the EPMs of both types of strains increased. Paunio et al. (1999) presented an epidemiological analysis of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in Finland in 1997. Infected individuals were found to have been significantly more likely to have swum in a shallow beach than matched uninfected controls implicating lake water as a vehicle of E. coli O157:H7 transmission. Livestock such a cattle are frequent carriers of E. coli O157:H7 and contamination of surface water with feces from livestock can result in the presence of these organisms in recreational and drinking water. Michel et al. (1999) examined the temporal and spatial distribution of 3001 cases of verocytotoxigenic (VTEC) E. coli occurring in Ontario, Canada. They found that cattle density had a positive and significant association with VTEC incidence of reported cases. Rice et al. (1999) determined the sensitivity to chlorination of isolates of E. coli O157:H7 from waterborne outbreaks. Chlorine levels typically maintained in water systems were found to be sufficient to inactivate these organisms. Holler et al. (1999) reported on the isolation of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli from municipal sewage indicating that contamination of either drinking or recreational water with improperly treated sewage could pose a health risk. responsible for human infections belonging to subspecies 1. Salmonella can be differentiated into over 2000 serotypes. In recent years taxonomists have suggested several different nomenclatures for Salmonella, but because of their complexity none has been generally accepted. Ingestion of Salmonella usually leads to one of three possible manifestations -gastroenteritis, systemic infection or an asymptomatic carrier state -with gastroenteritis being the most common outcome.",

Rajkowski and Dudley (1999) compared the recovery of Salmonella sp. and Vibrio sp. grown under nutrient limited conditions using nonselective and pathogen-specific selective media. For both of these organisms, spiked into filter-sterilized reconditioned wastewater, recovery was significantly higher using non-selective media than on selective media. The authors concluded that the presence of stressed or injured cells in low-nutrient conditions such as water samples could result in underestimation of the number of these pathogens present. Waage et al. (1999b) developed a PCR assay with two nested pairs of primers selected from a DNA fragment from the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome. When this assay was used to evaluate spiked water samples after overnight enrichment in non-selective media, detection levels as low as 10 CFU per 100 ml were found even in the presence of 8700 heterotrophic organisms and 1000 coliforms per 100 ml sample. A comparative evaluation between the ISO method and one based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the PROBELIA, for the detection of Salmonella in water was performed (Coquard et al., 1999) . Waters from different origins were tested either directly or after artificial contamination with selected Salmonella strains isolated from the environment. The results clearly demonstrated that the PCR-based method can advantageously replace the ISO 6340 method. It is quicker, less labor intensive, reproducible, and provides results that match those obtained by the ISO method.",

More than 90% of the Salmonella typhi isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) including the first reported isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin. The authors argued that mass immunization may be a useful measure for the control of prolonged MDR typhoid fever epidemics, as an adjunct to correction of municipal infrastructure and public health intervention.

They isolated the organism from sea water and edible bivalves. The incidence of this species in the samples studied was lower than that described for other geographical areas, probably due to the high salinity values of the Mediterranean Sea. The occurrence of Vibrio vulnificus in coastal sea water and sand was investigated by Ghinsberg et al. (1999) . V. vulnificus isolates were recovered from both sea water and sand. V. vulnificus was more frequently isolated during July, August and September. The relatively high isolation rate of this bacterium from sea water may be dangerous to bathers, fishermen, and divers with predisposed wounds. Marino et al. (1999) evaluated the accumulation and depuration of microorganisms in mussels maintained in static seawater, contaminated with 10 4 to 10 6 cells/ml. E. coli and S. typhi accumulated to a greater extent and were released from mussels more quickly than vibrios. Zanetti et al.

The assay allowed for the detection of 3 to 15 CFU of C. jejuni per 100 ml in water samples containing a background flora consisting of up to 8700 heterotrophic organisms per ml and 10000 CFU of coliform bacteria per 100 ml.

The major pathogenic species C. jejuni and C. coli were more prevalent in sand from non-EEC standard beaches indicating that Campylobacter strains associated with human infections are frequently found in sand on bathing beaches. Obiri-Danso and Jones (1999a) monitored two freshwater bathing sites, on the River Lune in the north-west of England over a 2 year period for fecal indicators, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, as well as, Salmonella and Campylobacter, to determine compliance with the EU Directive on Bathing Water Quality. Fecal indicator numbers showed no seasonal variation, with numbers in the bathing season similar to those in the nonbathing season. Fecal indicator numbers in the sediments were an order of magnitude higher than in the overlying water. Campylobacter numbers showed seasonal variation in the water with higher counts in winter than in the summer, although numbers were low. Higher numbers were found in the sediments but there was no seasonal variation. Analysis of various inputs showed that indicators and Campylobacters came from a mixture of sources, namely a sewage treatment works, agricultural run-off, streams and mallards. Thomas et al. (1999) Campylobacter coli and C. upsaliensis demonstrated comparable survival characteristics but were less resilient than C. jejuni and C. lari.

Members of the genus Arcobacter are Gram-negative, non-sporeforming rods. The cells are usually curved or S-shaped, and are motile with a darting, corkscrew-like motion by means of a single polar, unsheathed flagellum. Four species of similar general morphology are recognized: Arcobacter cryaerophilus (containing two subgroups, and formerly called Campylobacter cryaerophila), A. butzleri (also formerly C. cryaerophila), A. skirrowii, and A. nitrofigilis (formerly C. nitrofigilis). A. butzleri is the species most commonly associated with illness in humans and has been isolated from stools of patients with abdominal pain and/or diarrheal illness. It is not known how humans become infected by Arcobacters, but consumption of or contact with potentially contaminated water associated with travel has been suggested as a possible pathway. Rice et al. (1999) reported on the isolation of Arcobacter butzleri from a contaminated ground water source. Survival studies with this isolate indicated that it was capable of surviving in the ground water environment. The isolate was found to be sensitive to chlorine. The presence of thermophilic Campylobacters and Arcobacter was investigated in four types of sewage sludge taken from the treatment plant in Bologna (Italy): primary, activated, thickened and anaerobically digested sludge (Stampi et al., 1999) . Arcobacter butzleri were found in all types of sludge. They were less sensitive to anaerobic digestion than fecal bacteria, probably due to their microaerophilic growth properties; therefore, land application of digested sludges may cause high risks of infection.",

            "text": "In an epidemiological study of H. pylori infection among preschool children in Taiwan, Lin et al. (1999) found a higher incidence of infection in children from aboriginal townships than metropolitan areas. This suggested that a poor water supply system, sewage disposal, and other environmental hygiene in the aboriginal townships might have played some role in infection with H. pylori. Lindkvist et al. (1999) found that children who obtained their drinking water from rivers or pipers were significantly more likely to be infected with H. pylori than children who obtained their drinking water from a well in an epidemiological study in Ethiopia. Lindo et al. (1999) researched epidemiological associations between environmental and demographic factors and prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in a suburban Jamaican community. Logistic regression showed that sanitation and the presence of domestic animals were independently associated with H. pylori seropositivity, indicating that a combination of demographic, environmental and zoonotic factors is involved in the spread of H. pylori infections at the tropical community level. In a follow-up to a 1996 epidemiological study, Sasaki et al. (1999) assayed samples of tap and well water, in addition to soils, flies, and cow feces for the presence pylori, by PCR, in local water supplies. The seroprevalence of H. pylori in the study group was higher than rates in southern Canadian populations. The detection of H. pylori in local water supplies may indicate a natural reservoir for the organism or possible contamination from human sewage. In contrast, Bernstein et al. (1999) were unable to detect H. pylori DNA in lake water in an Indian village in Manitoba Canada where the incidence of infection among the residents was high.",

They recommended the use of direct inoculation onto selective solid growth medium for the recovery of Legionellae at concentrations of > or = to 1 CFU/ml. If Legionellae below this concentration are to be detected they recommend filtration of the sample through cellulose nitrate filters with incubation of the filter directly on the medium as the easiest and most sensitive technique. Saint and Ho (1999) developed a PCR test for the specific identification of Legionella longbeachae targeting a sequence unique to both serogroups 1 and 2. PCR testing was demonstrated as a superior method of identification to traditional seroagglutination reactions. Nakadate et al. (1999) reported on 3 patients who were admitted to the same hospital with atypical pneumonia. All 3 patients had elevated antibody titers for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, and had visited the same spa prior to the onset of their symptoms. Inspection of the spa resulted in isolation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 from the facility's hot water tanks and outlets.

Legionella of the same serogroups as those isolated from patients were present in each hospital water supply. Visca et al. (1999) While warm water systems are frequently cited as a reservoir for Legionella, Hoebe et al. (1999) investigated two nosocomial cases of Legionnaires' disease in a rehabilitation center in the South of Limburg, the Netherlands. Legionella cultures were made from respiratory patients' specimens, water samples and smears from all mixing taps (used in showers), samples from hot and cold water taps from the infected ward and from the five other wards. The strains were typed by serotyping and polymerase chain reaction. The circulating cold water sometimes warmed up to 40 o C (within the Legionella growth range). Cultures from the hot water supply were negative just like control cultures from five other wards and swabs from showerheads and hoses. The authors concluded that the combination of an elevated cold water temperature caused by heating along a distance by nearby hot water and heating piping and the regular stasis of water during the weekends when the ward was closed, most probably stimulated the multiplication of Legionella in the cold water supply. From July to September 1994, 29 cases of community-acquired Legionnaires' disease were reported in Delaware. Brown et al. (1999) conducted an investigation to identify the source of the outbreak and risk factors for developing Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 pneumonia. Water samples taken at the hospital, from eight nearby cooling towers, and from four of the patient's homes were cultured for Legionella. Isolates were subtyped using monoclonal antibody analysis and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction. The results of their investigation suggested that the hospital cooling towers were the source of the community outbreak.",

Waage et al.

Their procedure enabled the detection of 8-17 cfu 100 ml-1 water with background levels of up to 8700 heterotrophic organisms ml-1 and 10,000 cfu coliform organisms 100 ml-1 water.

Their results indicated that F-RNA phages and fecal coliforms are more susceptible than somatic coliphages to longer solar wavelengths, which predominate in seawater and therefore warrant consideration as fecal, and possibly viral, indicators in marine waters. Brion and Silverstein (1999) investigated iodine disinfection of a model bacteriophage, MS2. They observed that in the presence of dissolved organic substances, such as detergents and proteins, the inactivation of MS2 viruses decreased significantly.

Muniesa et al. (1999b) found that the ratios between numbers of bacterial indicators and the numbers of bacteriophages are much higher in feces of seagulls than in treated or raw sewage contributed by out-falls from the northern coastal area of Catalonia (North-eastern Spain). Muniesa et al. (1999c) determined the proportions of different morphological types of infectious somatic coliphages in fecally polluted freshwaters. Nasser and Oman (1999) Bacteriophages have been widely used as surrogates for human enteric viruses in many studies on virus transport and fate. Thompson and Yates (1999) investigated the fates of three bacteriophages, MS2, R17 and phiX174 in a series of batch dynamic systems. Their data suggested that viral inactivation in simple dynamic batch experiments is dependent upon (i) the presence of a dynamic air-water-solid interface (where the solid is a hydrophobic surface), (ii) the ionic strength of this solution, (iii) the concentration of surface active compounds in the solution, and (iv) the type of virus used. Deborde et al. (1999) studied the rapid transport of viruses in an unconfined floodplain aquifer near Missoula, MT, which was instrumented with 89 monitoring wells and 20 four-port multilevel samplers. Bromide, bacteriophages MS2, PRD1 and \u03a6X174 and the attenuated enterovirus poliovirus (type-1 CHAT) strain were seeded into the aquifer as slug injections. The authors observed that although relative attenuations at downgradient monitoring wells indicated that the virus tracers were attaching to aquifer material along the groundwater flowpath, the virus peaks arrived at observation wells at rates similar to that which was observed for the bromide tracer. Deborde et al. (1999) indicated that natural attenuation of a slug virus input over a \"typical\" source supply-set-back distance of 30.5m would most likely not reduce virus concentrations to proposed acceptable risk levels in similar cold-water high-velocity groundwater systems. Yanko et al. (1999) tested potable and monitoring wells located in close proximity to a large groundwater recharge project which utilizes a blend of surface water and reclaimed wastewater for recharge. The authors analyzed for coliphage over a six-month period to assess the potential for virus migration. The concentration and distribution of phage isolated was found to be quite different in chlorinated effluent compared to river water. The majority of isolates from reclaimed water were filamentous DNA F-specific phage suggesting that this group was more resistant to chlorine. Groundwater samples were analyzed using a novel large volume enrichment technique that proved very sensitive for determining low concentrations of phage. Chauret et al. (1999) assessed the extent of reduction in selected microorganisms during both aerobic wastewater treatment and anaerobic digestion of sludge at an Ottawa, Ontario, Canada wastewater treatment. The fate of two encysted pathogenic protozoa was compared with that of microbial indicators including somatic coliphages. A reduction in the numbers of somatic coliphages was observed during both aerobic wastewater treatment and anaerobic sludge digestion. Lasobras et al. (1999) studied the recovery of three groups of bacteriophages, somatic coliphages, Bacteroides fragilis phages and F-specific bacteriophages from the primary sludge of a biological treatment plant, a lime-treated sludge and in a de-watered anaerobically, mesophilically-digested sludge. All phages studied accumulated in the sludges. In primary and activated sludges, all three types accumulated similarly, but in lime-treated sludge and dewatered, anaerobically, mesophilically-digested sludge, the relative proportion of F-specific bacteriophages decreased significantly with respect to somatic coliphages and bacteriophages infecting B. fragilis. All phages survived successfully in stored sludge, depending on the temperature. F-specific bacteriophages survived less successfully than the others.",

Their study entailed determining the relative risk of hepatitis A among different occupations in Israel according to the incidence of hepatitis A in different occupations during 1993 and 1994 compared with the incidence of hepatitis A in two standard populations. After, age, gender, ethnicity, and time of immigration to Israel were controlled for, certain occupations showed a significant increased risk of hepatitis A: yeshiva students, day care center and kindergarten staff, food industry workers, teachers, physicians and dentists and therapists and medical technicians. Sewage workers and nurses did not show any significantly increased risk.",

(1999b) discuss the genomic characterization of human and environmental polioviruses isolated in Albania during a poliomyelitis outbreak in 1996. Their study confirmed the environmental circulation in Albania of recombinant poliovirus strains, probably sustained by a massive vaccination effort and by the presence in the environment of a type 1 poliovirus (isolated from the Lana River in Tirana, Albania approximately two months before the first case of symptomatic acute flaccid paralysis was reported in that town). Kaupert et al. (1999) studied the effect of gamma radiation on poliovirus infectivity seeded in sludge samples. This was done in order to determine the radiation dose required to inactivate 90% of viral infectivity (D10). A D10 of 3.34 kGy was determined for poliovirus type III, Sabin strain, suspended in sludge samples. This value dropped to 1.92 kGy when the virus was suspended in water. Manor et al. (1999b) 1994 . Between 1989 and 1997 sewage samples were processed in the laboratory with a double-selective tissue culture system. Wild-type poliovirus was isolated from 17 of them in four clusters, termed \"silent outbreaks.\" The AFP surveillance failed to detect the circulating wild-type viruses. Their study emphasized the important role that environmental surveillance can play in monitoring the eradication of polioviruses. Muscillo et al. (1999) performed the molecular and biological characterization of poliovirus 3 strains isolated from Adriatic seawater samples. Previous studies by the authors using RT-PCR had identified the presence of poliovirus type 3 (P3). In order to better estimate the risk to human health of these occurrences in bathing water, the authors developed a protocol to distinguish wild from Sabin P3 strains. Three sets of RT-PCR primers were engineered. Eight reference American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference strains, whose sequences were known, were also evaluated under the same experimental conditions. Egglestone et al. (1999) collected samples of sewage, seawater, river water, sand and silt from a sewage works at Weston-super-Mare, England and from coastal areas nearby over a period of several weeks during the summer of 1996. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to search for human astrovirus (HastV) RNA in concentrates of the samples.",

Both cause chronic diarrheal disease, particularly in immunosupressed individuals. The organisms undergo a complex life cycle during which cysts or oocysts are produced. These structures are highly resistant to disinfection but still remain infectious. Infectious dose for both organisms is extremely low with as few as 10 to 30 cysts or ooocysts capable of causing clinical infection. Cryptosporidium is now recognized as a common cause of diarrhea throughout the world. Although more than 20 species of Cryptosporidium are now recognized, only one, C. parvum is considered to be a human pathogen. Giardiasis is caused by Giardia lamblia, recently renamed G. duodenalis.

Studies on surface and filter backwash water were carried out using immunomagnetic separation coupled with in vitro culture and PCR (CC-PCR). As a comparison, samples were also assayed using Percoll-sucrose flotation with immunofluorescence for detection of oocysts.

A significantly higher infection rate was found in children with diarrhea compared with those that did not have diarrhea (Iqbal et al.,1999) . Tamburrini and Pozio (1999) determined that seawater and infected mussels could be a source of C.parvum for human infection. C. parvum oocysts were found to remain infectious after a one year incubation in artifical seawater. Oocysts were also observed to maintain their infectivity for 14 days in mussels. C. parvum oocysts were detected in Chesapeake Bay Bent mussels collected from areas where oocyst contaminated oysters were previously found. Oocysts were also able to be isolated from spiked blue mussel tissue. The researchers suggested that Bent mussels, which have wide distribution in the bay, may be valid biological indicators of Cryptosporidium contaminated water (Graczyk et al., 1999b) . Oysters were collected from seven sites in Chesapeake Bay that are used for commercial harvesting. Assay of these oysters indicated that C. parvum oocysts were present (Fayer et al., 1999) . Graczyk et al. (1999a) suggest that the Asian freshwater clam can be used as a biological monitor for contamination with Giardia. Using 160 clams in a 38 liter aquarium, spiked with 10 5 Giardia duodenalis cysts they were able to demonstrate the presence of cysts in clam tissue for up to three weeks after exposure. Water borne cysts were not detectable using the membrane filter technique 90 minutes after seeding the water. Giardia duodenalis Genotype A cysts were detected in Chesapeake Bay Macoma clams by Graczyk et al. (1999c) . Since Genotype A is the one most commonly associated with human infection, the suggest using Macoma clams as biological indicators for the presence of Giardia cysts. Levesque et al. (1999) analyzed over 4000 giardiasis cases in Quebec in an attempt to detrermine if a relationship existed between illness and drinking water quality. They found a lower incicence of giardiasis where the St. Lawrence river was used as the source of drinking water. They suggested that this might not be due to lower levels of contamination present in this source, but other variable should also be considered. Franzen and Muller (1999) reviewed the literature on cryptosporidia and microsporidia from a public health perspective. Sources of organisms, modes of transmission and reservoirs were considered. Dowd et al. (1999) compared the use of immunofluorescent analysis (IFA) and PCR for the detection of microsporidia in water. Their results indicated that IFA was an unacceptable method. The two methods used to isolate DNA from water as a source for PCR coupled with PCR were found to detect low levels of spores in water.",

Ribotyping with the restriction enzyme BglI suggested a high level of genetic diversity. Despite the low degree of correlation found between ribotypes and serotypes, the authors concluded that both methods are valuable techniques in studying the epidemiology of emerging serotypes of V. cholerae. Vibrio cholerae strains other than O1 and O139 (non-O1 Vibrio cholerae) are associated with sporadic diarrheal disorders and limited outbreaks of diarrhea and have often been reported in association with extraintestinal infections. Farina et al. (1999) described a fatal case of non-O1 Vibrio cholerae septicemia that occurred in a patient infected with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. They note that patients with this and similar diseases should be warned of the risk factors for acquiring such infection, including consumption of raw shellfish and exposure to sea and fresh water where shellfish are found. Radu et al. (1999) compared strains of Vibrio cholerae O1 and non-O1 with respect to presence of cholera enterotoxin (CT) gene by PCR-based assays and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. The CT gene was detected in all clinical isolates but was present in only a small percentage of isolates from environmental waters.

Both NLV genogroup I and II were encountered in some patient stool samples. However, NLV genogroup I was not detected in the water samples. The authors report that this is the first time NLVs had been detected in municipal tap water. Inadequate chlorination is reported to have contributed to the survival of the virus in water.Lodder et al. (1999) used RT-PCR to detect Norwalk-like virus RNA in sewage water concentrates. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products revealed identical sequences in stools of patients and related sewage samples. Their data show that high loads of NLVs may be present in sewage and further studies are warranted to address the efficacy of NLV removal by sewage treatment processes.Marx et al. (1999) used a combined application of epidemiological and molecular diagnostic methods to study an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis associated with Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) in a geriatric long-term facility. Their data indicated that in the absence of evidence for food-borne or waterborne transmission, NLVs likely spread among residents and employees of a long-term-care facility through person-to-person or airborne droplet transmission.Rapid notification of local health officials, collection of clinical specimens, and institution of infection control measures are necessary if viral gastroenteritis transmission is to be limited in institutional settings.Shieh et al. developed a rapid and sensitive detection method of low levels of viral agentsin outbreak implicated oysters. During development, the overall detection sensitivity of the method was 1 PFU/g of oyster tissue that was initially seed with Poliovirus type 3 (PV3) Sabin strain. The method was utilized to investigate a 1998 gastroenteritis outbreak in which contaminated oysters were the suspected disease transmission vehicle. A genogroup II Norwalklike virus was found in two of the three recalled oyster samples.Wallace et al. (1999) evaluated seafood-associated disease outbreaks in New York between 1980 and 1994.

Epidemiological studies of employees and three community clusters found illnesses in employees to be associated with drinking cold water at the bakery, and in the community cases with eating custard slices from a variety of stores supplied by one particular bakery. Small round-structured viruses were identified in stool specimens from 4 employees and 7 community cases. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated viruses of both genogroups (1 and 2) each with several different nucleotide sequences. The heterogeneity of the viruses identified in the outbreak suggested that dried custard mix may have been inadvertently reconstituted with contaminated water.",

Water Environment Research, Volume 72, Number 5. Literature Review 2000.It is known that avian influenza viruses provide the gene pool for the generation of new strains of human influenza virus, which can cause pandemic infections. A recent outbreak of avian influenza virus (H%N1) in Hong Kong not only produced high mortality in chickens, but also resulted in six human fatalities. This outbreak indicates that avian influenza virus can be pathogenic for humans.Lai and McPhillips (1999) surveyed local waterfowl habitats by taking water and fecal samples for virus isolation and identification. They isolated avian influenza virus from several ponds and small lakes on central Oklahoma. The risk of human infection remains to be determined, however, they encouraged primary care physicians to submit samples for virus surveillance.",

Quy et al. (1999) studied three Norway rat populations living on farmland and attempted to assess their potetnial as reservoirs of C. parvum. They observed C. parvum associated with these populatons and suggested that they could be a source of infection for livestock or humans.An Aquaguard water purifier consisting of a candle prefilter, activated carbon filter and UV irradiation unit was evaluated by Grabow et al. (1999b) . Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to detect seeded C. parvum oocysts and viruses. It was found that this apparatus was effective in removing bacteria, viruses and C. parvum oocysts from water.Haas and Aturaliye (1999) found that a combination of electroporation with combined chlorine, hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate resulted in enhanced inactivation of Giardia and Cryptosporidium. They suggest additional studies be done to determine the optinal conditions for control of these organisms in water. Carpenter et al. (1999) considered swimming pool conditions necessary for disinfection of C. parvum. They noted that the presence of fecal matter can change the concentration and time of exposure necessary for effective disinfection. Barbee et al. (1999) addressed the issue of transmission of C. parvum on environmental surfaces and medical devices by testing a variety of commonly used disinfectants and sterilization procedures. The only agent found to inactivate C. parvum greater than 3 logs was 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide. However, since C. parvum rapidly loses infectivity on dry surfaces it was suggested that current disinfection procedures guidelines are valid.",
