The trial nurse answered questions and addressed requests from 32 patients over the phone. Patients were referred to a doctor when necessary, either at the haemophilia treatment centre or at the emergency department. The study coordinator contacted 17 patients by phone, checking their medication supply, the correct arrival of shipments, and data on infusions and bleeding. Finally, the haematologist investigator delegated in charge of all trials carried out a total of 7 clinical trial visits, as well as medical telephone follow-up of acute situations: haemarthrosis, bleedings, questions and medical consultations related or not to haemophilia and to treatment adjustments.",

In less than 4 weeks our hospital, one of the biggest in Madrid, dedicated up to 95% of its facilities to managing COVID-19 patients. The Haemophilia Centre and its associated Unit were no exception and they have had to adapt to this new situation. Telemedicine, discussion with trial sponsors, and guidelines from AEMPS give us opportunities to cope with this situation always under the golden rule of benefitting our patients.",
