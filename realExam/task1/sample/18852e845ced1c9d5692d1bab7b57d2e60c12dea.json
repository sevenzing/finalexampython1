            "text": "Mobile Telecom Network today spans most of the country today. The overall tele-density stood at 91.82 as early as Jan-19 (https ://trai.gov.in/sites /defau lt/files /PR_No.22of2 019.pdf). We have close to 1.3 billion mobile phones in India today (https ://en.wikip edia.org/wiki/List_of_count ries_by_numbe r_of_mobil e_phone s_in_use and https :// trai.gov.in/sites /defau lt/files /PR_No.22of2 019_0.pdf). This is far cry from some 8 million telephones that India had 25 years ago and was adding less than 1 million telephones per year (Ramamurthi and Jhunjhunwala 1995) . One had to wait typically for 5-8 years to get a telephone line. The change took place, when the pair of copper wires carrying telephone signals from the telephone exchange to a home/ office (called wired local loop), got replaced by a wireless local loop. Initially the worry was that this would not give us reliable and quality telephony. But the continued Research and Development in the area of Digital Signal Processing and Communications, aided by Moore's law, made wireless telephony not only give us quality voice communications but also data communications at a per line cost much less than that was possible through wired phone (Jhunjhunwala and Ramamurthi 1998) . To Install a Wired telephone line in 1995, the telecom operator used to spend \u20b940,000 per line; today the operator spends less than \u20b92000 per line (not including the handset). This has brought down the tariff, and most people in India could afford mobile phones triggering huge growth. At the same time, technological development has given the ability to increase data-rates from a few kbits/s 25 years ago to tens of Mbits/s or even higher today with 4G without any additional costs.",

It could affect any individual who comes in proximity to another COVID-infected person. The worst is that during early stage, the patient shows no visible signs and disease starts showing up only after a few days. There is no vaccine for the virus as of now. The only defence therefore is social distancing; in other words, staying away from others who could possibly be infected. While appeals can be made for people to maintain this social distancing amongst themselves, a country like India with very high population density would find it very difficult to adhere to it for a prolonged period. This is specially so, where a large percentage of population lives in crowded homes with six to eight people sharing about 200 sq. ft. area. The only other way is to identify a person who could potentially be infected as soon as possible (while the disease shows up only later over the next couple of weeks), and isolate him/her completely, so as to not let the person spread the disease to the others. This could be done when the person is showing the first signs of getting infected or had come in contact with an individual who was later found to be infected or if the person had travelled to areas where the disease was widespread. Isolating the person, even if he/she does not turn out to be unwell, will ensure that the disease does not spread from him/her. Ideally if everyone who has potential to be infected is quarantined, one could stop spread of the disease.",

An individual downloads the application and first carries out \"Self-Assess\" (SA News Channel 2020), which helps a user figure out the risk of being infected by answering some simple question on his/ her health and travel-history and contacts over the last fifteen days. This questionnaire asks ten to twelve simple questions and is available in 11 languages (English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Bengali, Oriya, Marathi and Gujarati) and is likely to be available in other Indian languages soon. It then uses simple analytics to figure out the risk-status of the individual. An appropriate advice is then provided to the individual. If the person needs full quarantine, the person is contacted and taken to a quarantine centre. If the person is showing some signs, but does not warrant full quarantine, the person is advised self-isolation at home. If the person is well, he/she is informed and advised to keep practicing social distancing. The Aarogya Setu App also shows the Status (called Your Status) of the person all the time, provides a COVID-19 update and a E-pass feature, which enables an individual to apply for a pass to travel or move around if required during any lock-down. The App is also used for sharing the best practices and Advisories updated regularly. Some ten million individuals have downloaded and are using the App as on 25th April 2020.",

The work was done when 3G or 4G networks were not available and before smartphones came into India.
