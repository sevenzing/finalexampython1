SARS- 4 CoV-2 RNA was extracted from swabbed surfaces and objects and subjected to real-time reverse 5 transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and 6 E genes. Virus isolation from positive samples was attempted in vitro on Vero E6 cells. 7 Results: Twenty-six samples were collected and only two were positive for low-level SARS-CoV-2 8 RNA, both collected on the external surface of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) hel- 9 mets. All transport media were inoculated onto susceptible cells, however, none induced a cyto-10 pathic effect on day 7 of culture. 11 Conclusions: Even though daily contact with inanimate surfaces and patient fomites in contaminat- 12 ed areas may be a medium of infection, our data obtained in real life conditions suggest that it might 13 be less extensive than hitherto recognized. 14 Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; surfaces; environmental contamination.",

            "text": "Introduction. 1 Current data evaluating transmission routes for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are scanty and controversial. Our knowledge is essentially based on the evaluation 3 of various routes of transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV- 4 1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Influenza virus [1] . Although 5 direct contact transmission occurs most likely through droplets, the ability of these viruses to sur- 6 vive on inanimate surfaces has been reported by several studies [2] [3] . For instance, it has been 7 shown that SARS-CoV-1 can survive for at least 96 hours in sputum, serum, and stools [4] , which 8 may facilitate transmission if any contact with eyes, nose or mouth occurs following touch of in- 9 fected material. Similarly, droplets are thought to be the major driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, 10 even though the virus may potentially spread in the environment and transferred from inanimate 11 surfaces to hands. Recently published data indicate that fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may 12 occur, since the virus can remain viable for days on surfaces under controlled experimental condi- 13 tions, similarly to SARS-CoV-1 [5] . Disease amplification in healthcare settings has already been 14 documented for past SARS and MERS outbreaks [4] , and contamination of inanimate materials by 15 infectious respiratory secretions or other body fluids (saliva, urine or stools) would plausibly con-16 tribute to SARS-CoV-2 spread in the environment. The problem is further compounded by the pos-17 sibility that undocumented infection could facilitate the rapid dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 [6] . 18 Thus, efficient disinfection measures would be the first containment barrier to avoid virus spread 19 [7] . To this end, it has recently been shown that inanimate surfaces located outside patients' rooms 20 were free of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, suggesting that protective measures and current decontamination 21 procedures are effective, reducing concerns over the risk of fomite transmission in the healthcare 22 setting [8] . 23 However, recent findings indicate that extensive environmental contamination is indeed possible, as 24 shown by a survey on patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with mild upper respir-25 atory tract involvement. Multiple swabs taken in the patients' room and on staff personal protective 26 equipment (PPE) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 [9] . Interestingly, all samples taken 1 from two of three rooms after routine cleaning were negative. Beside the above-mentioned small 2 case series, literature regarding persistence of SARS CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces is limited to an-3 ecdotal reports. In this study, we report data on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on swabs col-4 lected from inanimate surfaces in an Infectious Disease emergency unit and in a sub-intensive care 5 ward that were deemed likely to be contaminated. 6 7 Methods. 8 Environmental samples from different surfaces were obtained using a flexible nasopharyngeal ny- 9 lon flocked swabs (FLOQSwabs\u2122, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) dipped in 3 ml universal transport 10 medium (UTM\u2122, Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy). In detail, flocked swabs were pre-moistened with 11 UTM in order to maximize the quantity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA removed from surfaces and of any 33\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in air, the inoculum was discarded and 1 mL of medium for respiratory viruses 22 was added (EMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine and 5 mg/mL 23 trypsin) to each well. Cells were incubated at 33\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in air and observed by light micro-24 scope every day for cytopathic effect (CPE). After a 7-day incubation, 200 \u00b5l of supernatant was 25 used for molecular assays. 26 The areas subjected to environmental SARS-CoV-2 RNA sampling included the Infectious disease 1 emergency unit, where febrile patients with respiratory symptoms were evaluated, and an infectious 2 disease sub-intensive care ward that allows advanced respiratory care. Both areas were considered 3 contaminated areas, and staff working here wore PPE consisting in liquid-repelling gowns, double 4 gloves, class 2 filtering face-piece respirators (FFP2) and eye protection (goggles or face shield). 5 Air change in our wards is typically 7 vol/h. Cleaning procedures were standardized. In particular, 6 ward surfaces were routinely cleaned twice daily (morning and early afternoon) with sodium hypo-7 chlorite at the concentration of 1,000 ppM of free chlorine (0.1%) on a daily basis and 5,000 ppM 8 of free chlorine (0.5%) during final sanitization after the patient(s) was(were) discharged. Swabs 9 were performed around 12 noon, approximately 4 hours after cleaning. ",

            "text": "Twenty-six samples have been collected in the locations shown in Figure 1 and from various sur- 13 faces and objects as shown in Table 1 . In the sub-ICU, swabs were performed in a double room 14 where 2 patients with CPAP helmets were allocated. In the emergency room, samples were collect-15 ed from two different rooms. Each room accommodated three patients, one of them with a CPAP 16 helmet. Samples were collected using identical procedures. 17 In swabbing the patients' rooms, we followed a specific order, working our way down from objects Our findings are at variance with the recently published case report analysis which showed that 9 most surfaces were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 RNA [9] , although no evidence of viable virus 10 with consequent infectious potential was provided. Importantly, staff PPEs and equipment, as well 11 as patient fomites in our potentially contaminated areas were SARS-CoV-2 RNA free. This is rele- 12 vant to daily practice, since contact with patient fomites in contaminated areas is thought to be a 13 risk factor for infection. These results obtained in \"real life\" conditions are also somehow in con-14 trast with those recreated in a laboratory environment aerosolized with a SARS-CoV-2 strain grown 15 in vitro [5] . In that study, several materials were examined for their ability to maintain virus viabil-16 ity, and it was found that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on cop-17 per and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours. In line with the above interpreta-18 tion and not unexpectedly, our findings cannot be compared with those reported under strictly con-19 trolled experimental conditions, with constant room temperature and humidity [5] . Indeed, surfaces 20 are cleaned twice daily and temperature and humidity may change over time. Another notable issue 21 is that, for patients on Venturi masks or CPAP helmets, oxygen support was set up with specific fil-22 ters, which are likely to reduce viral spread. Such differences may account for the discrepancies ob-23 served in the two studies. 24 In our study, the only two positive samples were taken from the plastic of the CPAP helmet, a few 1 centimeters from the patient's airways, while all other surfaces, including plastic bed rails, only 60 2 centimeters away from the patient's face and in continuous contact with his/her hands, were SARS- 3 CoV-2 RNA free. Thus, our data suggests that although environmental contamination may occur in 4 real life conditions, it might be less extensive than hitherto recognized. Moreover, the inability of 5 the SARS-CoV-2 RNA collected from the CPAP helmet to infect susceptible cell monolayers sug- 6 gests that recent contamination of plastic surfaces, which apparently maintain SARS-CoV-2 infec-7 tivity for several hours [5] , is unlikely to contribute to nosocomial spread most likely occurring ei-8 ther via aerosol or droplets, and/or direct physical contact by patients and staff. 9 A possible limitation of our study may be the timing of swabbing which was relatively close to the 10 cleaning procedures and the effectiveness of flocked swabbing for environmental sampling. Any- 11 way, sample collection from the environment was set-up on the basis of a precise workflow and it 12 cannot apply to surfaces that are not systematically cleaned, eg computer keyboards, telephones, 13 multi-parameter monitors, infusion pumps, etc. to cite but a few. The use of flocked swabs is also 14 reported by others in COVID-19 surveillance (12) and their use previously validated (13) . ",
