All started and spread in the Lombardy region, the most populated region in Italy (10.2 million of inhabitants), with an outbreak accounting for most of the Italian registered cases of COVID-19, thousands of hospitalized patients, 15% of whom required an admission in intensive care units 2 . Such a tsunami of acute patients punched the hospital system in a matter of 4 weeks, and forced the largest part of the region healthcare resources (3.2 beds/1000 inhabitants) to be reconverted into COVIDunits, with consequent dramatic imbalance between supply and demand for most non-urgent medical and surgical diseases 3, 4 . In particular, most patients with solid cancer awaiting surgical intervention had their surgery delayed indefinitely.

These are patients lacking any therapeutic alternative and therefore at risk of dying within few hours/few days if not surgically treated. Examples are: gastric tumors presenting with uncontrollable bleeding, pancreatic tumors with obstructive jaundice in which endoscopic palliation has failed, intestinal obstruction from tumors of the right colon and tumor perforation.Copyright \u00a9 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.-Orange category: nearly-urgent because of negative cancer-related biologic factors. These are patients for whom tumor aggressiveness or stringent therapeutic window (for instance at the end of neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy) mandate surgical intervention within few weeks, because of the risk of progression beyond resectability. In these patients the risk of progression equates the risk of death in the near future, and the net benefit of surgery is expected to be very high. Examples are resectable mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer or locally advanced rectal cancer. The orange group also includes tumors in which progressive or stable disease following neoadjuvant treatments appears still resectable (i.e. colorectal liver metastases, lymph node-positive gastric cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma).-Yellow category: non-urgent because of positive biologic factors in the absence of nonsurgical alternatives. In these patients, the biological behaviour of disease is not particularly aggressive, but no therapeutic alternatives nor neoadjuvant treatments allowing surgery to be deferred are available. The risk of progression during waiting time is relatively low and does not imply a risk of death in a short time, while the expected outcome after surgery is generally good, thus maintaining a high net benefit of delayed surgery. Examples are: T1b-T2 N0 gastric cancers, most of hepatocellular carcinomas, <T3 colorectal cancers. In this category, tumors following neoadjuvant treatments with partial/complete response are also included (i.e. colorectal liver metastases, lymph node-positive gastric cancer etc.); patients who progress during the delayed waiting time should be reclassified into the orange group.",

Since oncological patients are rarely an urgent indication to surgery, the principle of \"the sickest first\"which implies prioritising those with the worst future prospects if left untreatedremained applicable only to selected cases, identified by the red category. \uf0b7 The concept of survival benefit informed the rest of the model. Survival benefit is the survival gain offered by a given therapy (in this case surgery) in comparison with the best alternative option (in this case delayed surgery or palliative treatments). This principle, widely used in organ transplantation 9 , has the potential of maximizing the total years of life gained when applied to a population of similar patients in need of surgical intervention 10 . We framed the orange, yellow and green categories according to this principle, considering that priority of surgical intervention decreases in parallel with the net health benefit expected in each group.",
