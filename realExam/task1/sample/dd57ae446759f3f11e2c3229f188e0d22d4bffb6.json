Subsequent work has shown these guidelines maximize benefits but may need additional ethical considerations to enhance equity and fairness. 8 International commentaries and triage guidelines have been released in response to the current crisis. 9,10 While Canadian physicians can learn important lessons from these, they should be aware that differences in healthcare systems, healthcare cultures, and national values may limit or alter the applicability of these guidelines.",
