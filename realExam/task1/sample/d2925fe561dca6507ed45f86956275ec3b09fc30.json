An occupational health audit, which included a walk-through of the hospital 'hot spots' carried out by the authors, revealed a small number of deficiencies which could well be weak links in an otherwise strong preventive chain. That the cluster of cases included housekeepers is also significant-preventive measures need to target much broader groups of HCWs than just the doctors and nurses in direct contact with patients. Frontline HCWs like counter clerks, porters and ambulance drivers are also at risk, and must be educated and protected.",

Higher-risk procedures with the potential for splattering or spraying of sputum or other body fluids require the use of full-face shields, and improved respiratory protection such as the use of powered airpurifying respirators. Perhaps the most important personal hygiene measure that all HCWs can adopt is regular handwashing.

An audit of these newly implemented safety measures might reveal lapses. Even if adequate measures, including the provision of facemasks, gloves and gowns, and proper waste decontamination procedures are in place, their observance may be lax because of lowered vigilance or simply human error. For example, the tight seal around the wearer's face may be compromised if respirator fit testing is not properly carried out; and improper handling of contaminated biohazardous waste might result in serious consequences.
