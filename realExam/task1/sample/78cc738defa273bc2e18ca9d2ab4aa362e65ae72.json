By contrast, Breban and colleagues [22] calculated that the risk of MERS-CoV to have pandemic potential does not exceed 5%, but they did not take into account the effect of the Hajj mass gathering in their scenario. Memish et al [23] showed that circulation of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is much lower than it was feared, announced, or predicted, and that no significant rise in detection rates could be observed along 1 year. In addition, mass gatherings in KSA during the pilgrimages of 2012 and 2013 were associated neither with an increased number of cases, nor with reported clusters of cases [24] , suggesting poor or moderate interhuman transmission. Our results support the latter and that MERS-CoV in its current form may not have the pandemic potential as those of other respiratory viruses, including that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [22] . Due to the MERS-CoV situation, the Saudi MoH recommended that elderly people (>65 years), people with chronic diseases (eg, heart disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes), and pilgrims with immune deficiency (congenital and acquired), malignant disease, and terminal illnesses, as well as pregnant women and children (<12 years), postpone the performance of the 2013 Hajj for their own safety. This advice was also endorsed by the US CDC for pilgrims traveling to Saudi Arabia for the 2013 Hajj. In our study, 15.3% of the population was \u226565 years old, and although data on underling health conditions were available for a minority of the cohort and only related to diabetes and hypertension, 18.7% had at least 1 of these 2 conditions. Both are disorders for which the Saudi MoH recommended potential participants postpone doing the Hajj in 2013. Although our results cannot be extrapolated to all Hajj pilgrims, they suggest that despite the MoH recommendations, a proportion of the pilgrims were unaware or did ignore this advice. This is not without precedent; a study of a cohort of 167 French pilgrims participating in the 2012 Hajj season found that 39% were over 65 years of age and 59% had at least 1 risk factor mentioned in the MERS-CoV MoH recommendations [21] .
