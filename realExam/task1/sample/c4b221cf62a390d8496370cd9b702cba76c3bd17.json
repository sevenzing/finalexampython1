Twenty nine (29/114; 25.44%) patients suffered from chronic diseases. Neutrophils counts in 23.68% (27/114) of patients were abnormally low and abnormally high in 21.05% (24/114). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein levels were abnormally elevated in 76.5% (62/81) and 62.9% (66/105) of patients, respectively. Creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) and troponin levels were above the normal range in 7.10% (8/112), 66.7% (10/15), and 100% of patients, respectively. The percentage of patients in which the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired O 2 (FiO 2 ) ratio exceeded 200 was 60%. A total of 91 (91/114; 79.82%) patients displayed severe bilateral pneumonia, 52 (52/114; 45.61%) exhibited ground-glass opacity, and pulmonary consolidation was observed in 4 (3.51%) patients. Differences in shortness of breath, insomnia, inappetence, the procalcitonin (PCT) levels, FiO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 among the three groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Differences between the mild and severe groups was observed in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, CD4 expression, and levels of C-reactive protein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and albumin (P < 0.05). Between the mild and critical groups, differences were observed in neutrophils, platelets, and CD4 expression (P < 0.05). A difference in C-reactive protein levels between severe and critical groups was also found (P < 0.05).

No statistically significant gender bias was experienced in the patients enrolled in this study, consistent with a report evaluating 138 patients hospitalized in Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan between January 1 and 28 (9) . However, these data differ from early reports that indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection was more likely to affect males (8, 10) . A possible explanation is that cases in previous studies were from the earliest phase of local outbreak and the subsequent phase of the local epidemic, mostly related to exposure associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most workers of which were males. The cases described herein were from the widespread national outbreak stage (9) . In the current stage, no male dominance among the patients was evident, with fewer patients having been exposed to the Seafood Market (11) . Furthermore, the mean age of COVID-19 patients presenting in the present study was 46.5 years. This result is consistent with the research of Yang Yao in Shaanxi province outside Wuhan (12) . In that study, the majority were mild cases (86.84%), and only 9.6% required a ventilator, far fewer than those reported in prior studies from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (11) , indicating that this disease has potentially become more mild as the chains of transmission have grown.

The data in this study indicate a history of high family grouping (42.1%) and close contact with COVID-19 patients (57.9%). These data are evidence of efficient human-tohuman viral transmission. A reason for the rapid spread may due to abundant routes of transmission. According to the sixth edition of guidance for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory aspirates, droplets, contact and feces, and even vertical transmission (15) . Another explanation may be atypical symptoms in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. From data-driven analysis, the basic reproduction number in the early stage ranged from 2 to 3.5, such that each case was linked to 2-3.5 new infections (16) (17) (18) (19) .

The presenting symptoms included fever (19.4%), cough (63.16%), sputum (28.95%), inappetence (19.30%), and shortness of breath (14.91%), followed by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, insomnia, frequent urination, headache and sore throat. In comparison, fever was observed in more than 90% of hospitalized patients (9, 10, 14) . We speculate that increases in confirmed asymptomatic cases were due to the wide use of RT-PCR fast detection technology and intense surveillance. Compared with symptoms in mild patients, more common in severe or critical patients included shortness of breath, insomnia, and inappetence. Symptom onset may allow physicians to identify patients with poor prognosis. Individuals suffering from viral pneumonia typically exhibit low oxygen saturation, deviations in blood gas levels, and clear abnormalities in chest imaging scan including areas of patchy consolidation, ground glass opacity, alveolar exudate, and interlobular involvement (20) . The present study found similar chest imaging results. The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in the present study were depressed numbers of leucocytes, lymphocytes, lower hemoglobin content, platelets, CD4 expression and PaO 2 , and reduced levels of albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and creatine kinase, in addition to elevated total bilirubin, ALT, AST, pro-BNP, and troponin. These laboratory abnormalities are consistent with prior findings in those with SARS-CoV2 infection (14) , and even MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection (9) , suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with cellular immunodeficiency, myocardial and hepatic injury, nutrient consumption and hypoxemia. Compared with patients with mild symptoms, those with severe or critical symptoms exhibited differences in neutrophil count and CD4 expression. Differences in CRP levels were also found in severe and critical groups ( Table 5) . The difference in neutrophil count and CRP may be related to the cytokine storm induced by virus invasion of the virus.
