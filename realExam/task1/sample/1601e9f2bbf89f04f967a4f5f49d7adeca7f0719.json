The data used was an anonymized 5% sample of the Medicare claims data from 2015 and 2016. This data spanned the transition from International Classification of Diseases version 9 to version 10 (ICD-10) on October 1, 2016. The dataset used to create the model was created by identifying all living members above the age of 18 on 9/30/2016. Only fee-for-service members were included because medical claims histories for other members are not reliably complete. We then excluded all members who had less than 6 months of continuous eligibility prior to 9/30/2016. We also excluded members who lost coverage within 3 months after 9/30/2016, except for those members who lost coverage due to death. Exclude members who lose coverage in the next 3 months not due to death. The labels for the prediction task were created by identifying all patients who had an inpatient visit with an admission date from 10/1/2016 through 12/31/2016 with a primary diagnosis from one of the listed categories. A 3-month delay was imposed on the input features to the model, so that no claims after 6/30/2016 were used to make the predictions.
