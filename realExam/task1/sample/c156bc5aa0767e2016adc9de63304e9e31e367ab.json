Centrilobular groundglass opacities in addition to nodules and \"tree-in-bud\" opacities in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who underwent bone marrow transplantation [1] \u2022 \"Latent\" TB refers to someone who has a positive TST with no history of tuberculous infection or imaging evidence of active or old disease (most often detected when undergoing routine screening for employment or school) \u2022 \"Inactive\" TB refers to someone with imaging evidence of prior tuberculosis but no sign of active disease Imaging \u2022 One or more foci of lobar or segmental air-space consolidation that is usually homogeneous, dense, and well defined (Fig. 6 .29) \u2022 If multiple, randomly distributed throughout the lungs \u2022 Cavitation is infrequent. \u2022 Characteristic apical pleural thickening and fibronodular appearance in one or both upper lungs (Fig. 6 .31; see Fig. e6 .44) \u2022 CT -enlarged lymph nodes typically have a low-density center (due to caseous necrosis) with rim enhancement (reflecting granulomatous tissue); may demonstrate subtle cavitation that is not visible on chest radiographs (see Fig. e6 and is almost diagnostic of postprimary tuberculosis \u2022 Because an apical lesion may be obscured by overlying clavicle or ribs, an apical lordotic view is often of value \u2022 Cavitation is common (about 50%) and characteristic of postprimary disease (Figs. 6.33 and 6.34; see Fig. e6 .47) \u2022 The presence of cavitation indicates that the disease is highly contagious, and this finding alone warrants putting the patient in respiratory isolation \u2022 Air-fluid levels in cavities are uncommon and usually a manifestation of superinfection (see Fig. e6 .48) \u2022 Tuberculous cavities may result in endobronchial spread and the classic \"tree-in-bud\" pattern of centrilobular bronchial dilatation and filling by mucus, pus, or fluid, associated with a linear a b Note the thickening of bronchial walls (white arrow) [1] branching pattern that resembles a budding tree and is generally more pronounced in the lung periphery (see Figs. e6.49-e6.51) \u2022 Other complications of cavitation include rupture into the pleural space (leading to empyema or bronchopleural fistula) and the development of a pseudoaneurysm of the pulmonary artery (Rasmussen aneurysm) \u2022 Pleural effusion and lymph node enlargement are rare in postprimary tuberculous disease (though common and sometimes the only finding in primary disease) \u2022 As the disease heals, fibrotic changes develop in the surrounding lung, which cause volume loss in the affected segment with displacement of the fissures and hilar structures (see Fig. e6 .52) \u2022 CT -because the diagnosis of typical postprimary tuberculosis is generally evident on chest radiographs, CT is primarily used to assess the extent and nature of the disease (more sensitive for demonstrating cavitation and such complications as vascular erosion, rupture into the pleural space, and miliary and endobronchial spread)",
