It should be user-friendly and able to give instrument-free readouts for early detection of pathogens. 1 This desperate need was experienced during the Ebola 2014-2016 outbreaks. 2 The second annual review released by World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2018 emphasized on the urgent need for the development of better and improved diagnostic tools for prioritizing the epidemic diseases. The detection of Ebola, Zika, Marburg virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and many more have been prioritized. 3 Recently, CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx) tool for nucleic acid sequence recognition has productively delineated its potential to fulfill the requirements of an ideal diagnostic tool for pathogens, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and cancer detection. 4 CRISPR-Cas system found in bacterial system is amongst the many protective strategies that the cell utilizes for the eradication of extracellular genome or to resist the phage infection. Being an adaptive immune response, CRISPR-Cas systems have the ability to memories, adapt and lyse the nucleic acid sequences that have been previously or newly encountered. 5, 6 The endonuclease proteins (eg, spCas9, Cpf1) found during the interference event of CRISPR-Cas that are programmed using the mature cr-RNA (commonly known as guide RNA) to target the desired sequence present in cell. 7, 8 This has proved to be advantageous for genome editing since it is convenient, rapid, simple, cost-effective, and offers lower chances of off-targeting as compared with alternative tools including zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases. 9 2 | SHERLOCK'S VENTURE",

In the presence of a specific guide RNA, it recognizes its target RNA and executes its nonspecific RNA degradation activity. 10 East-Seletsky et al 10 have taken the advantage and demonstrated the use of Cas13 for the detection of 0.01 nM of \u03bbRNA with high specificity, using the signals generated from fluorophore-quencher based reporter RNA molecule ( Figure 1 ). In a recent issue of Science, two articles reported the development of a CRISPR-based highsensitive diagnostic platform. 11, 12 Gootenberg et al 4 have developed a cost-effective (0.61$ per test) platform for in vitro detection of nucleic acid sequences, which could detect up to attomolar (aM) concentrations without compromising the specificity. This platform has been termed as Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK). In SHERLOCK, the target sequence is amplified with recombinase polymerase amplification for DNA detection (RPA) or reverse transcriptase-recombinase polymerase amplification for RNA detection (RT-RPA), an isothermal, nucleic acid amplification technique that eliminates the use of thermal cycler. The resultant amplified DNA sequence is then subjected to in vitro T7 transcription, and produced RNA molecule is detected by Cas13-guided reporter assay. The fluorescence signal is monitored using the spectroscopy 4 ( Figure 2 ). SHERLOCK has the potential to specifically detect lentiviral particles at a concentration of 2 aM, which harbors Zika and Dengue virus's nucleic acid fragments. It has also the ability to detect Zika virus directly from clinical isolates from serum, urine, and saliva, having a titer as sensitive as 3.2 aM, and through RNA extraction from the same material, a more sensitive detection up to 2.1 aM has been achieved. SHERLOCK is a powerful tool that allows us to distinguish between Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; as well as can efficiently figure-out the clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying antibiotic resistance genes. 4 Furthermore, by addition of single mismatch to its synthetic guide-RNA molecule, SHERLOCK can potentially detect SNPs with high specificity, and is also able to detect a clinically relevant range of low-frequency cancer mutations. 4 3 | SHER\" LOCK\" IS THE \"KEY\"",

The multiplexed detection is achieved by optimizing the cleavage preferences of different Cas13 orthologues towards different sequences of the reporter molecule. In a system containing a pool of different Cas13 orthologues and its guide RNA, a particular target sequence could be recognized by a specific orthologue of Cas13. Cas13 orthologue would prefer to cleave a particular RNA reporter molecule, generating a specific range of fluorescence signals. 11 For improved multiplexed detection, Cas12a has been used along with Cas13 RNAse. 11 F I G U R E 1 Schematic representation of CRISPR-based diagnostic tool, in the presence of the appropriate gRNA, Cas13 recognizes the target RNA sequence that is complementary. On-target recognition, Cas13 activates its nonspecific RNAse activity that can cleave any nearby RNA sequences.

The inclusion of Csm6 could improve the amplification of the output signal 11 avenue for paper and fluorescence-based readouts directly from the body fluids, hosting the Zika virus at aM concentration limits and that too within less than 2 hours. 12 Additionally, this system could facilitate the detection of Dengue virus directly from the patient's blood or saliva. 12 SHERLOCK alone is capable of discriminating the different types of Dengue virus serotypes and closely related flaviviral species with less than 3.2% and 0.22% off-target fluorescence, respectively. However, Myhrvold et al 12 presented an experimental design, which is rapid and could detect the recently found SNP S139N in the Zika virus from patient samples of a 2015-2016 pandemic with paper-based readouts. 12 6 | SHERLOCK AN ATTENTION",

The intact reporter molecule would form complex with antibody-conjugated nanoparticles as well as with streptavidin (2, 3) . The formed complex cannot move further with flow as streptavidin attached to substratum restricts the flow of the complex (3). Therefore, a red colored band would appear at the streptavidin line due to nanoeffects (4) . B, In the presence of the target sequence in the sample, the reporter molecule would no longer remain intact (1) . The fluorescent molecules of lysed reporter could form complex with antibody-conjugated nanoparticles (2) while biotin would form complex with streptavidin. The antibody-conjugated nanoparticle-fluorescent molecule complex would move further and get trapped in the antibody-capture line (3). Therefore, a red colored band would appear at the antibody-capture line due to nanoeffects (4) 11 different bacteria and differentiate their antibiotic-resistant strains with exceptional sensitivity and selectivity. 4 SHER-LOCK can also detect SNPs and cancer mutations and have shown its adaptability for rapid and reliable development of new tests for recently detected Zika virus. 4, 12 So far, SHERLOCK with HUDSON has shown impressive and versatile qualities, it could definitely act as an attentionseeking tool for reliable and cheap diagnostics for infections and genetic disorders.",
