The aim of this study is to describe the microbial load andcomposition and spatial distribution of aerosols in dental clinics. Methods: In four dental clinics active and passive sampling methods were used before, during and after treatment and at different locations. Retrieved colony forming units (CFU) were sequenced for taxon identification. Results: The samples contained up to 655 CFU/plate/30 minutes and 418 CFU/m 3 /30 minutes during dental treatment for active and passive sampling, respectively. The level of contamination after treatment and at 1.5 m distance from the patient's head was similar to the start of the day. The highest contamination was found at the patient's chest area. The aerosols consisted of 52 different taxa from human origin and 36 from water. Conclusion: Contamination in dental clinics due to aerosols is mainly low, although high level of contamination with taxa from both human and water origin was found within 80 cm around the head of the patient. Our results stress the importance of infection control measures on surfaces in close proximity to the head of the patient as well as in dental water lines.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "ARTICLE HISTORY", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In dental clinics, aerosols are produced while using dental hand pieces, such as ultrasonic scalers, air rotors, micromotors and/or air-water syringes [1] .

We should, however, keep in mind that in our study, only bacterial contamination was determined. Viruses are much smaller and therefore they can probably reach greater distances from their source. So, contamination of the air with viruses via droplet nuclei, can probably reach further than was found for bacteria in our study. Furthermore, settling of bacteria was determined, which is defined as the number of bacterial cells that are settled on a certain surface. When studying the transmission of airborne microorganisms, it is more important to study how long these microorganisms remain airborne. Studies have proven that viruses, such as the bacteriophage MS2, can remain airborne for hours in or on small aerosol particles. Since normal settling only reduces the viral load for about 48% in 45 minutes, it is advised to maintain proper ventilation of the treatment room to remove smaller aerosol particles that may contain viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 [31] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1198, "end": 1202, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the bacterial contamination caused by droplets and droplet nuclei is only of concern during dental treatment and tends to concentrate around the head of the patient. No increase in bacterial contamination was found at 1.5 m from the oral cavity. Both human-and water-derived bacteria were found throughout the treatment room. These results stress the importance of infection control measures on surfaces in close proximity to the head of the patient.
