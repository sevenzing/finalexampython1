Given the established fundamental role of cardiovascular imaging in modern healthcare, and the specific value of cardiopulmonary radiology in COVID-19 patients, departmental organisation and imaging programs need to be restructured during the pandemic in order to provide access to modern cardiovascular services to both infected and non-infected patients while ensuring safety for healthcare professionals. The uninterrupted availability of cardiovascular radiology services remains, particularly during the current pandemic outbreak, crucial for the initial evaluation and further follow-up of patients with suspected or known cardiovascular diseases in order to avoid unnecessary complications. Suspected or established COVID-19 patients may also have concomitant cardiovascular symptoms and require further imaging investigations. This statement by the European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology (ESCR) provides information on measures for safety of healthcare professionals and recommendations for cardiovascular imaging during the pandemic in both non-infected and COVID-19 patients.",

If this is not possible e.g. due to a limited number of available primary scanners, other scanner types (e.g. SPECT-CT scanners or the cone-beam function of angiography suites) could be used as \"COVID-19\" patient scanners for general purpose use. The objective would be to either divert (potentially) infected patients to a specific scanner as previously mentioned, or to increase capacity on other CT-scanners who are better suited for cardiovascular applications, depending on the local situation. Notably, all scan protocols on non-routine CT-scanners (e.g. SPECT-CT scanners) must be adapted to provide sufficient diagnostic quality, for which close cooperation and coordination with industrial partners might be helpful.",

Conversely, cleaning between scanning of two (or even more) established SARS-CoV-2 positive patients is not necessary unless (bacterial) superinfection is known, and local guidelines may differ. Currently, there are no universally accepted guidelines on how to clean radiology imaging equipment for SARS-CoV-2, although some centres have published their experience, proposing different methods and solutions for disinfecting the several components of CT and MR examination rooms [8] . Lists of disinfectants effective against SARS-CoV-2 have been published (https ://www.epa.gov/pesti cide-regis trati on/listn-disin fecta nts-use-again st-sars-cov-2), while a solution of 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 min of possible contamination has also been suggested [11] . Additionally, several manufacturers have published equipment-specific guidelines for disinfection of their imaging equipment (Table 1 ). Down-time for disinfection between patients varies according to the local available resources and also on the targeted imaging equipment. The immediate availability of \"cleaning\" teams for scanners with mixed populations of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients is advised to achieve maximum safety and productivity.",

While RT-PCR has a very high specificity making a positive test pragmatically diagnostic, its reported sensitivity varies between 60 and 70%, leading to a potential 30-40% of falsenegative results (also due to other factors). Given their multiple patient contacts under sometimes difficult conditions, healthcare imaging professionals are especially at risk for infection and might also transfer this infection to vulnerable patients or colleagues. To avoid this pathway of spreading, and its potential catastrophic impact on patients and hospital departments, high vigilance for potential infections of staff members is necessary. RT-PCR testing policies vary between hospitals, regions and countries depending on several factors. In many hospitals, the RT-PCR test is not indicated for asymptomatic staff members, and consequently routine swab testing of asymptomatic hospital personnel for screening purposes is not performed. Given the indicated lower sensitivity of RT-PCR test, a negative result does not necessarily equate to being free of infection. Possible strategies for follow-up of healthcare professionals who have been in contact with infected patients (in-or outside the hospital) include selfscreening for fever twice a day and vigilance for respiratory symptoms. Once a healthcare worker shows any clinical sign of infection, he must be removed from the staff pool for further investigation.",

A main cause of high troponin levels and myocardial injury could be represented by acute myocarditis of varying severity. In a few cases the occurrence of myocarditis in COVID-19 has been reported but rarely associated with cardiac dysfunction. A recent autopsy study has revealed significant viral RNA in the heart (among other organs) exceeding levels of viremia [22] . This data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 spreads of the bloodstream and can infect other organs. Additionally, myocarditis has been associated in the past with other coronavirus diseases as MERS [23, 24] . In a case series of 150 patients, 7% of deaths were reported as related to acute heart failure consequent to myocarditis [16] . Nevertheless, the exact relation between the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pathogenesis of myocardial damage is not fully understood and further investigation is necessary. Increased troponin levels could also be related to acute type II myocardial infarction (mismatch between oxygen supply and demand without unstable coronary artery disease) or to plaque rupture caused by severe inflammation (type I myocardial infarction). Such a relation between inflammation and cardiovascular events have been previously reported in influenza and in other coronavirus infections [25] .",

One must consider that echocardiography (and especially transoesophageal echocardiography, which is a high-risk procedure like intubation) cannot be performed with keeping a distance of at least one meter to the patients and/or is requested as a bedside test on the ICU. CT and MR on the other hand also need patient preparation and cannulation which require patient contact with radiographers and nurses [29] . Transportation and contamination of MR and CT scanners also should be considered as a source of potential infection. Finally, the length of the examination also must be optimised as this is also associated with potential virus contamination of the scanner systems and well as reduced patient tolerance in those who are sicker and find supine imaging difficult to maintain.",
