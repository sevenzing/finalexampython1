The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analysed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined as more than three times higher than the normal serum cardiac troponin level. During hospitalization, 24 of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 patients died in hospital. The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury, 14 vs. 8. Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein, average 153.6 ng/L vs. 49.8 ng/L, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, 852.0 ng/L vs. 197.0 ng/L, were significantly higher than in patients without myocardial injury. Thus, the prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, who face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study suggests that it is important to monitor and manage myocardial injury during hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septa, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients with HF than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12).",
