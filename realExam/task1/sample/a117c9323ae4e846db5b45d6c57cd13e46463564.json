Interestingly, the dye could not travel to the middle pituitary after injection in other parts of the body (limbs, tail) alone or injection of the perinasal area alone (data not shown). This result suggests that some kind of vessels and (drainage) tissues may exist in the central pituitary area and are extended from or connected with the perinasal tissue.

Thus, inspired by Louveau et al.'s study(4), we conducted a further immunofluorescence assay to confirm the lymphatic vasculature in the central pituitary. As shown in Figure 2, the central pituitary region of the adenohypophysis was positively labelled with the lymphatic endothelial marker Lyve-1 (green, Fig. 2B) as a capillary structure arrangement. Notably, no colocalization of the vascular endothelial cell markers CD31 (red in Fig. 2C) and Lyve-1 was found (Fig. 2D and Fig. 3), suggesting that lymphatic vasculature but not blood vasculature exists in the central pituitary region of the adenohypophysis. We hypothesized that these small lymphatic vasculatures (called central pituitary lymphatic vessels) may maintain communication with the nasal lymphatic vessels. Perinasal tissue may communicate with central pituitary lymphatic vessels in a specific and unidirectional manner. Interestingly, in our study, Evans blue was concentrated in central pituitary lymphatic tissue only when it was injected around the perinasal tissue; Evans blue was not found in the pituitary when injected in other parts of the body (limbs or tail, data not shown). This finding may indicate that only perinasal lymphatic tissue (vessels) is specifically connected to the pituitary (central pituitary lymphatic tissue) in a unidirectional manner.",

            "text": "Louveau et al.'s cerebral lymphatic drainage study, Evans blue could not be detected in the deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLN) 30 min after injection into the nasal mucosa; therefore, the researchers believed that meningeal lymphatic vessels were the only way to drain CSF(4). However, our findings showed that Evans blue specifically accumulated in the middle of the adenohypophysis (possibly through the perinasal-pituitary lymphatic vessel pathway) 2~4 hours after injection around the nasal mucosa. This finding suggests that Evans blue might be absorbed by the perinasal reticular (lymphatic) tissue and then reaches the pituitary via perinasal lymphatic drainage, through which it enters the CNS to participate in cerebral lymphatic circulation.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that anatomically observed and showed the existence of lymphatic vessels in the pituitary (lymphatic drainage).Although further studies and evidence are needed to verify these results (from the lymphatic draining or from the immune defence perspective), we believe that thispossible perinasal lymphatic-central pituitary lymphatic-central nervous system drainage route, together with classical meningeal lymphatic drainage, can ultimately comprise a complete loop for cerebral lymphatic circulation, the perinasal lymphpituitary-CSF-meningeal lymph-perispinal lymph lymphatic drainage loop. Taken together, our results, particularly those regarding the possible specificity and unidirectionality of the aforementioned perinasal-central pituitary lymphatic connection, indicate that pituitary-lymphatic drainage may play a key role in the regulation of cerebral infection caused by respiratory pathogens(1), which invade the CNS via the perinasal tissue due to the abnormal communication of the perinasal-pituitary lymphatic refluxes(1, 7).
