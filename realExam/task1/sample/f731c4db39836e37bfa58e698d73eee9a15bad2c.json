            "text": "Psychologists, mental health professionals, researchers, and public policy makers are becoming increasingly aware that exposure to traumatic events is not a rare occurrence and is related to a number of trauma-related disorders (Gold, 2008) . For example, a national study utilizing a large sample of adults residing in the USA found that 89.7% had experienced at least one DSM-5 Criterion A traumatic event and that many had experienced more than one type of trauma (Kilpatrick et al., 2013) . Another study found that 69% of a sample of over 4000 US women reported having experienced a traumatic event over the course of their lifetime (Resnick et al., 1993) . While prevalence rates in community samples are high, studies of clinical populations have found significantly higher prevalence rates (Mauritz, Goossens, Draijer, & van Achterberg, 2013; Shi, 2013) . Given the high prevalence rates of trauma exposure, it is very likely that forensic psychologists will find themselves involved in civil or criminal matters involving the assessment of an individual who has experienced at least one significant traumatic event. Although ethical practice is critical in all aspects of forensic practice, evaluating individuals who have experienced complex trauma can present some unique difficulties that are important for psychologists to understand. This paper will address those ethical considerations that are critical for any forensic evaluation, as well as discuss how repeated trauma can increase the complexity of forensic practice.",

A forensic evaluator will conduct an independent psychological evaluation in order to obtain information in response to a specific psycho-legal question (Dalenberg et al., 2017) . The evaluator may then be asked to prepare a written report and /or to provide testimony about that evaluation and their expert opinions. For example, in civil contexts, they may be asked to evaluate a plaintiff who has alleged compensable injury as a result of a traumatic event or series of events. In this example, the evaluator may be asked to assess the individual's prior level of functioning, the impact of the traumatic events, and the extent of harm, or damages incurred as a result (Foote & Lareau, 2013) . Forensic evaluators may also be asked to determine the time at which an individual reasonably knew or should have known about a connection between a traumatic event or events and any alleged resulting injuries. In criminal cases, forensic evaluators may be called upon to assess an individual's state of mind at the time of an alleged offense and to opine about the possible impact of traumatic events on that person's state of mind. At sentencing hearings, forensic psychologists could be asked to evaluate an individual's history to identify any potential traumatic events that could be used as mitigating factors.",

They may also provide valuable information about ways in which an individual's experiences of traumatic events may influence their participation with the legal system or may influence the ways in which they tell their story.

While the APA Ethics Code applies to all psychology specialty areas, including Forensic Psychology (Bush 2020) , certain sections of the code may be relevant for forensic practice, generally, and forensic assessment involving complex trauma, more specifically. The Code is composed of an Introduction, a Preamble, General Principles A-E, and specific Ethical Standards. The Preamble and General Principles of the Code, in contrast to the Standards, are aspirational in nature. \"Their intent is to guide and inspire psychologists toward the very highest ethical ideals of the profession\" (APA, 2017, p. 3). The General Principles are not meant to be obligatory in nature but rather provide an overall context for ethical behavior. The second section of the Code consists of specific standards for ethical behavior which are \"enforceable rules for conduct as psychologists\" (APA, 2017, p. 3) .",

In spite of the relatively low incidence of PTSD among trauma survivors, individuals who have experienced traumatic events are likely to be overrepresented within forensic settings. For example, Dalenberg et al. (2017) contacted two large law firms in California in 2016 and found that the attorneys estimated that over 80% of law suits included allegations of trauma. Claims of emotional injury involving pain and suffering can be raised in cases involving harassment, discrimination, rape and sexual assault, personal injury, and disability. In these cases, forensic psychologists are frequently called upon to assess the impact and emotional damage resulting from a specific traumatic event or events and may need to opine about the relative impact and sequelae of a number of traumatic events that have occurred over the course of an individual's lifetime. It is also important to understand that many of the prevalence studies do not evaluate the frequency with which a particular trauma happened, with many reporting the number of categories rather than how many instances of a particular trauma are present (see Bailey & Brown this issue) .",

They may also need to address the sequelae of traumatic events that have occurred during childhood and draw conclusions about ways in which those traumatic events have impacted the individual's life trajectory. Within the criminal arena, forensic psychologists may be called upon to assess the impact of traumatic events on an individual's state of mind at the time a crime occurred or to help to explain their behavior during of following the commission of an alleged criminal act. They may also be asked to elaborate upon the presence of traumatic events as mitigating factors to be taken into account during sentencing. However, it is important to note that much of the research has been completed on singleincident trauma survivors and, therefore, may not well represent individuals with repeated and/or ongoing trauma exposure.",

Exposure to this type of repeated trauma has been shown to increase the likelihood of chronic and complex issues, as well as significantly increased risk for further victimization (Briere, Agee, & Dietrich, 2016; Briere, Kaltman, & Greene, 2008; Cloitre et al., 2011; Courtois & Ford, 2013; Herman, 1992) . The proposed clinical syndrome describing the constellation of difficulties experienced by adults who were severely and repeatedly traumatized during childhood is referred to as complex posttraumatic stress disorder (cPTSD) (Courtois, 2008; Herman, 1992) . A study of the prevalence of complex PTSD as defined in the ICD-11 found prevalence rates of 0.6% in a representative community sample of US adults and 13% in a sample of US trauma exposed military veterans (Wolf et al., 2015) .",

In their book on the treatment of complex trauma, Courtois and Ford describe the ways that complex trauma can result in major changes in the following \"seven key domains of an individual's development: emotional regulation, memory, attention, and consciousness, self-perception, perceptions of the perpetrator, relationships with others, somatic symptoms and/or medical problems, and sense of meaning in self, others, and the world\" (Courtois & Ford, 2013 . In a literature review, Bailey and Brand (2017) have further delineated the connections among and between childhood traumatic events and the development of enduring and severe sequalae, including cPTSD and dissociation. It is critical that forensic evaluators are aware of the connection between trauma and dissociation because individuals who have been diagnosed with cPTSD have been found to experience trauma-related dissociation with more severity and frequency than other populations (Brand, Schielke, Brams, & DiComo, 2017b; Hyland, Shevlin, Fyvie, Cloitre, & Karatzias, 2019) .",

            "text": "Dissociation Dissociation is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed) as \"a disruption and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior\" (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013, p. 291). It is often conceptualized as an adaptive response designed to assist with coping with trauma when physical escape is not possible (Dalenberg et al., 2012) . Although dissociation can be present in a variety of clinical presentations, such as somatic, substance use, and psychotic disorders, it is most commonly related to trauma (Bailey, Boyer, & Brand, 2018; Lyssenko et al., 2018) . Dissociative disorders are more prevalent than is commonly realized (See Bailey et al., 2018; Bailey & Brand, 2017; Loewenstein, 2018) . In his recent review, Loewenstein (2018) found prevalence rates in the general population ranging from 9.1 to 18.3% and prevalence rates in clinical populations ranging from 4.6 to 48% across diverse samples. Given that dissociation has been associated with a range of functional impairments, as well as poor prognosis and lower quality of life, it is particularly important that forensic evaluators involved in the assessment of trauma also assess for dissociative symptoms (Brand, Schielke, & Brams, 2017a; Brand, Schielke, Brams, & DiComo, 2017b; Frankel, 2009) . Assessment of complex trauma and dissociation in a forensic context is a highly specialized area that requires expertise and training in both forensic psychology and trauma psychology (Brand, 2016; Dalenberg et al., 2017) . Unfortunately, there is an overall lack of training and education about trauma and dissociation, and the information is often missing or inaccurate in many psychology textbooks and training programs (Courtois & Gold, 2009) .",

In addition, various aspects of identity can increase the likelihood of experiencing a traumatic event and developing dissociative symptoms, particularly when an individual identifies with a group that is relatively disempowered within the dominant culture (Bailey et al., 2018) . Sensitivity and understanding are similarly required in a forensic context, especially when there is a need to delineate the specific impact and potential harm experienced as a result of a traumatic event. Forensic psychologists must also be aware of the power imbalance inherent in the relationship between psychologist and evaluee and the ways in which that power imbalance may impact the evaluee's behavior and state of mind throughout the evaluation (Bailey et al., 2018) ",

While both types of testifying experts, evaluators and scientific framework experts, speak with attorneys and educate them about trauma and dissociation, their role is to provide independent and scientifically informed information rather than advocacy. They should be free of conflicts, and their opinions should not vary depending upon the retaining party. In contrast, a forensic psychologist hired as a consultant may be retained to work with the legal team to assist with their preparation and execution of their side of the case, and there is no expectation that they will evaluate the individual or provide testimony. In their capacity as forensic consultants, they may work with the legal team to assist them in their understanding of the psycho-legal issues and in evaluating opposing expert depositions and reports. They may also assist with legal strategy such as jury selection and preparation of questions for deposition or direct or cross examination of witnesses. However, in this role, they do not provide expert witness testimony or conduct evaluations. They are considered a member of the legal advocacy team and do not have the same expectations of independence and objectivity as those providing expert testimony.",

They highlight the necessity of respecting these role differences and argue convincingly that ignoring the role conflict jeopardizes both the therapeutic and forensic endeavors for the patient as well as the rights of all involved parties. Since this article's publication, there has also been increased awareness of the ethical challenges presented when forensic psychologists are asked to assume a clinical role after the conclusion of the legal matter (Drogin 2019; Melton et al., 2018) .",

One must therefore first ascertain who the individual client is. In most civil evaluations, the client will be an attorney, either for the defense or for the plaintiff. However, the client could also be the court, in cases of a court-ordered evaluation. At the time of the initial contact with the retaining party, the forensic psychologist should also determine who is involved in the case in order to identify any potential conflicts (Foote & Lareau, 2013) . Ethics Code Standard 3.06 also clarifies obligations related to conflict of interest and Standard 3.07 deals with third-party requests for services (APA, 2017) . Ensuring that the role of the evaluator is clearly explained is even more critical when evaluating a trauma survivor because they frequently present difficulties with establishing trust, particularly when a power differential is present (Courtois and Ford 2009) .",

Further, the evaluee should be prepared for the potential difficulty of the evaluation, given the need to disclose trauma-related information in a time-limited setting (Dalenberg et al., 2017) .",

This type of intense exposure can be potentially overwhelming for the individual being evaluated. As a result, the evaluator needs to pay attention to the pacing of the evaluation and may need to offer frequent breaks. In addition, the evaluator needs to pay attention to the ways in which the individual being evaluated in responding to questions and to the degree to which they are present and grounded. They will need to work to help the individual being evaluated remain within a window of affect tolerance, in order to maximize the quality and accuracy of the data being gathered (Brand, Schielke, & Brams, 2017a; Brand, Schielke, Brams, & DiComo, 2017b) . This may seemingly put the forensic evaluator at odds with the role of the forensic evaluator as an objective investigator, and the evaluator must take care not to blur their role between forensic evaluator and treating clinician. However, a competent forensic assessment will require use of both clinical and assessment skills, particularly when evaluating a survivor of complex trauma. In many circumstances, the evaluee may be in therapy, and it is prudent to request that the therapist be \"on call\" and available to the individual to assist them with issues related to safety, stabilization, and distress tolerance during and following the evaluation. In those circumstances where the evaluee is incarcerated, it is helpful to consider that overt distress can make someone a target and ensure that there is sufficient time to help the individual regulate before returning to their cell.",

In addition, difficulties with emotional regulation and management of impulses, as well as engagement in highrisk behaviors such as self-injury or substance use, may also interfere with their interactions with the legal system (Brand, Schielke, & Brams, 2017a; Brand, Schielke, Brams, & DiComo, 2017b) . Judges and juries may have difficulty understanding the apparent lack of emotional response of an individual who is testifying about their experiences, and the testifying forensic expert will need to clearly explain the individual's behavior in a way that helps the triers of fact make sense of what they are seeing.",

In addition, the evaluator will not have the benefits of eliciting the information in the context of a therapeutic relationship that occurs over time, which may increase vulnerability to vicarious traumatization. Vicarious traumatization, which is distinct from burnout and compassion fatigue, can produce in the evaluator (or therapist) the same symptoms experienced by the trauma survivor (Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995; Saakvitne & Pearlman, 1996) . Similarly, Dalenberg (2000) addresses the impact of countertransference on the therapist's ability to hear and understand what the trauma survivor is trying to communicate. Considering the risks of vicarious traumatization and their potential negative impact on the psychologist and on the forensic evaluation, it is imperative that the forensic evaluator engage in self-care. Clinician self-care can include things such as diet, exercise, sleep, and time off, as well as consultation and personal therapy (Frankel, 2017; Saakvitne & Pearlman, 1996) .",

In particular, the recognition of trauma psychology and forensic psychology as specialized areas of practice has been emphasized. Therefore, forensic practitioners who wish to evaluate victims of complex trauma and trauma specialists who wish to become involved with forensic practice both will require specialized training, education, and professional consultation, as well as ongoing continuing education in order to maintain the requisite competencies. Forensic practitioners need to remain aware of the relevant laws and regulations governing the jurisdictions in which they intend to practice and remain aware of potential role conflicts. In addition, the need for cultural competency as well as an ongoing awareness of ways that exposure to trauma will impact the individual being evaluated and their participation in the legal system as well as the forensic psychologist are essential. Forensic psychologists should rely upon evidencebased and trauma-informed assessment tools and make use of multiple data sources when conducting evaluations. Knowledge and comfort with the appropriate use of measures specific to trauma and dissociation as well as awareness of the ways in which complex trauma survivors that respond to broad-based measures are also essential. An evaluator who attends to these ethical and professional considerations can contribute greatly to the field of forensic psychology. As concluded by Dalenberg et al., \"Taking into account the devastating consequences that trauma can produce, as well as the resilience of the human spirit, the forensic evaluator can help the court come to a just and balanced solution in civil and criminal matters\" (2017, p. 556).",
