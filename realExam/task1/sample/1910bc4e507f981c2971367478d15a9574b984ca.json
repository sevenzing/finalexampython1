In order to guide political decision-making via epidemiological criteria, it is crucial to assess the real impact of the epidemic. However, the use of large-scale population testing is unrealistic or not feasible in some countries. Based on a newly developed mathematical model, we estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin American countries. The results show that the virus spreads unevenly across countries. For example, Ecuador and Brazil are the most affected countries, with approximately 3% of the infected population. Currently, the number of new infections is increasing in all countries examined, with the exception of some Caribbean countries as Cuba. Moreover, in these countries, the peak of newly infected patients has not yet been reached.",

A precise correction requires the use of previous mortality records, but this information is not always available in most of the countries under consideration. In fact, we excluded Venezuela and other countries in the analysis due to the poor quality of the data. In this context, we should be more cautious with estimates in Latin American countries than in European countries. In our estimations, we assumed an infection mortality rate (IFR) of 1.2%. Recent research [11] establishes that the IFR can range from 1 \u2212 1.4%; however, we must analyze the above factors on the demographic structure, epidemiological profiles, and quality of the health system. Further refinement is not possible due to unreliable data. From a public health perspective, our model helps to understand deeper insights as the virus spreads in these countries and to obtain important information such as the estimated seroprevalence of the population in a simple, low-cost procedure, which can be helpful to guide the next actions [7] . We are currently making efforts to maintain up-to-date estimates in the different countries of Latin America and other parts of the world on our website (https://covid19-modeling.github.io/).
