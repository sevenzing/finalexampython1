On admission, he presented with no neurological deficits and no respiratory signs or symptoms. He had persistent severe headache and one episode of fever with a blood pressure of 170/111 mmHg, oxygen saturations of 99% on room air and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Chest radiography showed bilateral infiltrates, and so a nasopharyngeal Covid-19 swab was taken which confirmed active COVID-19 infection. Laboratory findings are reported in Table 1 .

It is an emerging disease and knowledge within the scientific and clinical community is increasing, but gaps remain in the collective understanding. While COVID-19 is primarily a disease with respiratory manifestations [1] , there are increasing reports of cardiovascular and thrombotic complications which are important for clinicians to be aware of. It is known that during infection with COVID-19 there is a pro-inflammatory immune response, that the severity of inflammation corresponds with the severity of the clinical situation, and that high levels of inflammatory processes are associated with a hypercoagulable state. Coagulopathy has been observed in similar diseases [10] including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses, respectively [11] . Expert consensus suggests prophylactic treatment with LMWH should be considered during admission and for 7-14 days after discharge for patients with COVID-19. Clinicians need to consider the options for treatment doses during admission and beyond discharge in patients with multiple risk factors [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 334, "end": 337, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 794, "end": 798, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1265, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1269, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1273, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1277, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1278, "end": 1281, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "CVTS accounts for only 0.5-1% of strokes.

There are inherited and acquired risk factors for CVTS. In this case, inherited causes were thought unlikely due to age and a lack of prior thrombotic events. Acquired causes include brain tumours, head trauma and local central nervous system infection, none of which were present in this patient. A prothrombotic state is a risk factor for CVTS and this patient was positive for COVID-19.
