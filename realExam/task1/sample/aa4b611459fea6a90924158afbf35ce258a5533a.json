The pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants 20 showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3x10 -4 substitutions/site/year. Almost half of sequence changes were C->U transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C->U and U->C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E 25 and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C->U transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5'U/A and 3'U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U>>A>G>>C) and low G+C contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C->U hypermutation in their hosts. 30 Importance: The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution.

hypermutation is the action of RNA editing processes within the infected cell. A well characterised antiviral pathway involves the interferon-inducible isoform of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 1 (ADAR1)(15). This edits A to inosine in regions of viral185 double-stranded RNA, which is subsequently copied as a G. Irrespective of its widely demonstrated antiviral role in a range of typically minus stranded RNA viruses, the mutations it creates do not match those observed in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. Firstly, ADAR1 target dsRNA so editing effects tend to be symmetric with A->G substitutions being matched by T->C mutations. Secondly the direction of mutation is wrong. The focus of the analysis in the current study was on infrequent or 190 unique polymorphisms where ancestral and mutant bases can be inferred. The excess of C->U transitions is the opposite of those induced by ADAR1. A second, interferon-inducible pathway edits retroviral DNA during transcription and is strand specific; its typical antiviral activity is to mutate single stranded proviral DNA formed after first strand synthesis 195 from genomic RNA (16-18). The deamination of C's to T's leads to the observed excess of G->A changes in the complementary positive stranded RNA virus genome (19). This editing function is performed by members of the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family, many of which possess defined antiviral functions against retroviruses, hepatitis B viruses, small DNA viruses and intra-cellular mobile retroelements (reviewed in (20)). The APOBEC3 gene family members 200 that are primarily involved in antiviral defence show evidence of extensive positive selection and expansion over the course of mammalian evolution, particularly in the primate lineage. Humans possess 7 active antiviral proteins (A3A, A3B, A3C, A3D, A3F, A3G and A3H) that contrasts with single A1 gene in rodents and a range of other mammals (21, 22).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": ", the substitution rate reconstructed for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other coronaviruses may represent an uncomfortable amalgam of both the accumulation of neutral changes and forced changes induced by APOBEC-like editing processes that may obscure temporal reconstructions. ://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20034470); only a tiny fraction of variable sites (0.34%) were 250 found to phylogenetically informative, while a high frequency of unresolved quartets demonstrates further the lack of phylogenetic signal in SARS-CoV-2 evolution reconstructions.
