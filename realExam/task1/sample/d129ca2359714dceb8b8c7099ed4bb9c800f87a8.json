Sequence analyses of ORF1ab unravelled emergence of mutations especially in the viral RdRp and helicase at specific positions, both of which are important in mediating viral RNA replication. Since proteins are dynamic in nature and their functions are governed by the molecular motions, we performed normal mode analyses of the SARS-CoV2 wild type and mutant RdRp and helicases to understand the effect of mutations on their structure, conformation, dynamics and thus function. Structural analyses revealed that mutation of RdRp (at position 4715 in the context of the polyprotein/ at position 323 of RdRp) leads to rigidification of structure and that mutation in the helicase (at position 5828 of polyprotein/ position 504) leads to destabilization increasing the flexibility of the protein structure. Such structural modifications and protein dynamics alterations might alter unwinding of complex RNA stem loop structures, the affinity/ avidity of polymerase RNA interactions and in turn the viral RNA replication. The mutation analyses of proteins of the SARS-CoV2 RNA replication complex would help targeting RdRp better for therapeutic intervention.",

The life cycle of the virus involves receptor attachment and ingress, viral RNA translation, replication, assembly and egress. All these individual steps of the virus life cycle depend on host cell and viral factors. Viral proteins are of two major categories, the structural proteins and the non-structural proteins. While role of structural proteins is mainly to form the viral structure and encase the viral genome, the non-structural proteins play crucial roles in mediating viral RNA translation and replication [1, 2] . In Coronaviruses viral non-structural proteins are encoded by the open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. These include nsp1-4; 3C like proteinase; nsp6-10; RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); helicase and 3'-5' exonuclease.",

Proteins are dynamic molecules and their conformations and dynamics might influence their biological functions. Thus, mutations that alter the protein conformations might in turn modulate the dynamics and also the function. RNA viruses are prone to high frequency of mutations. The rate of mutation itself depends on the fidelity of the RNA polymerase itself and the mutations dictate the virus evolution, immune escape variants and overall variations in the viral genome in the population [3, 4] . When polymerase itself is prone to mutation, the fidelity will also get affected and this property might lead to emergence of drug resistant phenotypes. Mutations might also be correlated with the geographical region-specific virulence of a virus variants and carefully targeting the proteins for designing antiviral or vaccine candidates. Along with the structural protein spike, RdRp is another important target of therapeutic intervention. In this study we have studied the sequence variation of SARS-CoV2 ORF1a polyprotein. We have identified proteins that got mutated the most (RdRp and helicase) and investigated the effect of such mutations on the respective protein structure and function.",

High mutation rate might also allow new variants to escape antibodies and establish as antibody escape mutants which might also lead to expansion of tissue tropism of a virus.
