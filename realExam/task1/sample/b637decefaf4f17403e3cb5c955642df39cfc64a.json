Methods and Results: Blood-monocytes and cells from mesenteric lymph nodes were obtained from pigs and cultured with live Bb12 for 4 and 12 h. Transcript levels of IL-10 and TLR2 were analysed. Furthermore, TLR2 was blocked to determine its participation in IL-10 production. TLR2 blockade was achieved with neutralizing antibodies, followed by stimulation with Bb12. Bifidobacteria induced IL-10 production in both swine monocytes and mesenteric cells. Monocytes with TLR2 blockade had a decrease in IL-10 transcripts, while mesenteric cells did not. Bacterial cell wall components were responsible for Bb12-induced IL-10 production since no IL-10 was detected in the culture supernatant. Conclusions: We demonstrated that IL-10 production is largely mediated through the recognition of Bb12 structures by TLR2, as bacterial metabolites in the culture supernatant failed to induce IL-10 expression.

Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which these immunological benefits are exerted is not fully understood. One mechanism is by the activation of diverse pattern recognition receptors located on the membranes of immune system cells, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. TLR activation leads to differential cascades in signalling pathways, transcription factors expression and cytokine production to induce the appropriate immune response (Akira and Takeda 2004) . Specifically, TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid on Gram-positive bacteria (Akira and Takeda 2004) , such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (Zeuthen et al. 2008) . Moreover, interest in the porcine immune system has been growing for its similarity with humans in terms of genetics, anatomy and physiology. Therefore, studies on the pig immune system could provide relevant information about the human immune response (Fairbairn et al. 2011; Bailey et al. 2013; Mair et al. 2014) .

First, we examined for IL-10 transcript expression at 4 h after stimulation. We found a similar increase in IL-10 levels correlated with Bb12 stimuli in monocytes and MLN cells (Fig. 1a) . The cytokine quantification in both types of cells stimulated for 12 h also yielded significant differences compared to unstimulated cells (Fig. 1b) . Notably, unstimulated MLN cells showed some basal IL-10 production compared to unstimulated blood monocytes; this effect could be due to the source, since MLN cells are somehow primed by stimuli, such as food or commensal bacteria, and subsequently migrate to MLN, unlike peripheral blood monocytes, which are nonprimed cells. This difference in IL-10 production can also be an effect of the cell composition; since blood-derived monocytes are 100% antigen presenting cells (Fig. S1 ) while in the MLN comprise about 30% of the cell population (Fig. S2) . However, regardless of the cell type, there was an increase in IL-10 production in both populations induced by Bifidobacterium, which could direct the anti-inflammatory response.

To test the participation of TLR2 in IL-10 production, an anti-TLR2 blocking antibody was used prior to bacterial stimulation, and the expression of IL-10 was quantified in blood monocytes stimulated with Bb12 for 2 and 4 h. A significant increase in IL-10 was observed after 4 h of stimulation, while no increase in IL-10 mRNA was observed with 2 h of stimulation. The IL-10 transcript level was significantly decreased when TLR2 was blocked (P < 0\u00c1001) (Fig. 2a) . These results suggest that the IL-10 production induced by Bb12 occurs through the interaction of the receptor TLR2 with the bacteria. We evaluated the participation of the transcription factor NF-jB in IL-10 production in swine monocytes stimulated by Bb12 with or without anti-TLR2 antibody blocking prior to bacterial stimulation for 2 and 4 h. No significant changes of NF-jB transcript level were observed under any of the conditions examined (Fig. 2b) . Figure 1 Bb12 induces IL-10 expression in swine cells.

However, contrasting results have been reported when using specific strains; for instance, bifidobacteria and some lactobacilli polarize DCs towards a regulatory phenotype, whereas other lactobacilli promote Th1-inducing cytokine production in DCs (Christensen et al. 2002; Zeuthen et al. 2006) . Over the past years, a substantial amount of in vitro and in vivo evidence has confirmed the potential capability of some bifidobacteria strains to modulate the immune response, specifically their ability to polarize to anti-inflammatory (Imaoka et al. 2008; Mortaz et al. 2015) and regulatory (Jeon et al. 2012) responses. Citar et al. (2015) found an increase in the expression of IL-10 and the repression of IL-6 and IL-12b induced by several bifidobacteria strains on the monocytic THP-1 human cell line in the presence or absence of LPS (Citar et al. 2015) . In a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (PIE), Bifidobacterium breve MCC-117 shows anti-inflammatory effects against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) though induction of IL-10 in CD4 + C25 High Treg lymphocytes (Fujie et al. 2011) . In another report, pretreatment with either B. longum BB536 and B. breve M-16V reduce the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 induced by ETEC in PIE cells; blockade of TLR2 abolished the reduction of cytokines levels showing that TLR2 is required for the effect (Tomosada et al. 2013) . Our results show that Bb12 can stimulate swine immune cells to produce IL-10, hence inducing an anti-inflammatory response. The fact that Bb12 is capable to induce IL-10 expression in swine monocytes is suitable, considering that the probiotic can interact with recruited monocytes during infection and inflammation. In a recent report, rotavirus-vaccinated gnotobiotic pigs co-colonized with Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG and B. lactis Bb12 had higher levels of ileal IL-10 compared to vaccinated pigs only, which may enhance intestinal specific IgA response (Kandasamy et al. 2014) . Immune cells produce varying amounts of IL-10 upon TLR2 ligation (Jang et al. 2004; Netea et al. 2004) , which depends on the cell type. For instance, IL-10 can be produced by T regulatory cells and myeloid DCs, while plasmacytoid DCs are poor IL-10 producers (Boonstra et al. 2006; Maynard et al. 2009 ). Our results indicate that in vitro stimulation of swine cells with Bb12, increase the IL-10 mRNA levels in monocyte-derived peripheral blood cells and MLN (Fig. 1a) ; however, the production of the cytokine was only observed in monocytes but not in MLN (Fig. 1b) . We ruled out that the increase in IL-10 transcript was due to an increase in TLR2, since TLR2 levels were similar in all the conditions evaluated whether stimulated or not (Fig. 1c) . Contradictory results for the mRNA levels of TLRs after stimulation with bacteria have been reported. For instance, the oral administration of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 increases the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 to activate an innate immune response in cells from the lamina propria (Castillo et al. 2011) . However, only an increase of TLR9 expression but not significant changes in mRNA expression for either TLR2 or TLR4 was observed in the proximal colon of piglets fed with lyophilized Bifidobacterium Bb12 born from sows fed with Bifidobacterium Bb12 during gestation (Solano-Aguilar et al. 2008) . These findings suggested a selective induction of TLR9 by higher levels of Bb12 compared to piglets born from sows that did not receive Bb12 or mothers treated only with Bb12 during the last trimester of pregnancy. Similar results were obtained in weaning piglets fed daily with 10 7 , 10 9 -10 11 CFU per ml of B. animalis RA-18 for 2 weeks. Moreover, TLR2 was increased in mononuclear cells isolated from the ileum of gnotobiotic pigs fed a combination of L. rhamnosus GG+B. animalis Bb12. In contrast, TLR9 levels were low in all tissues . Cells of the MLN and ileal Peyer's patches of suckling piglets produce cytokines after in vitro stimulation with heat-killed lactic acid-forming bacteria (Tohno et al. 2006 ) via TLR2 and TLR9. However, the results from the present study suggest that the IL-10 expression in swine monocytes stimulated with live bacteria of Bifidobacterium Bb12 is mediated through TLR2 since the bacterial DNA was unlikely available for recognition due to the short stimulation period (4 h) (Fig. 2a) , although we did not test for TLR9 expression. Each probiotic strain shows specific immunomodulatory characteristics in a dose-dependent manner (Latvala et al. 2008) , suggesting that the differences in IL-10 activity or receptor recognition expression depends on the amount of bacteria. In addition, it is also important to consider the bacteria condition-that is, whether these organisms were used live, lyophilized, UV-killed or heat-killed. In the present study, bacteria were used live, but unable to proliferate given the composition of the cell culture media and growth conditions, which are not favourable for Bb12 growth.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 371, "text": "(Christensen et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 372, "end": 392, "text": "Zeuthen et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 633, "end": 653, "text": "(Imaoka et al. 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 654, "end": 673, "text": "Mortaz et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 689, "end": 707, "text": "(Jeon et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 719, "end": 738, "text": "Citar et al.

NF-jB-deficient macrophages have lower levels of IL-10 expression than NF-jB-sufficient macrophages this fact is explained by several studies with cells deficient for tumour progression locus 2 (TPL2) or NF-jB1, which support the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the induction of IL-10. TPL2 is an upstream activator of ERK; following TLR stimulation, TPL2 becomes dissociated from the TPL2-NF-jB1 complex and activates ERK (Banerjee et al. 2006) . Bifidobacterium animalis AHC7 attenuates NF-jB and protects against Salmonella typhimurium infection in mice (O'Mahony et al. 2010) . The expression of IL-10 can be induced by TLR or non-TLR signaling in myeloid cells. The activation of TLR results in the activation of NF-jB, p38 and ERK pathways. Activation of these pathways results in the induction of IL-10 production and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Saraiva and O'garra 2010) . The results of the present study suggest that Bifidobacterium Bb12 does not activate the NF-jB pathway during the first 4 h of stimulation in swine monocytes. Probiotics can alter the NF-jB pathway at many different levels: degradation and ubiquitination and inhibition of proteasome function (Petrof et al. 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 354, "text": "(Mortaz et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 920, "end": 942, "text": "(Banerjee et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1054, "end": 1076, "text": "(O'Mahony et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1375, "text": "(Saraiva and O'garra 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1691, "text": "(Petrof et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 122, "text": "(Fig. 2b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "We further tested if the immunomodulatory properties were due to a metabolite produced by Bb12, hence the culture supernatant was used to stimulate mononuclear cells, but no IL-10 production was detected (Fig. 3a) .

(2006) , demonstrated that B. breve C50 (BbC50) supernatant induced prolonged DC survival, maturation and high IL-10 production through TLR2. Bifidobacterium breve BbC50 secretes extracellular components comprising a lipoprotein putatively associated with glucose moieties and acting in an aggregating form as an agonist of TLR2/TLR6 (Scuotto et al. 2014) . Additionally, probiotic culture media may use TLR4 through IRAK-2 and via AP-1 to prevent IL-1b-induced IL-6 induction in immature enterocytes (Meng et al. 2016 ). However, the involvement of TLR2 in this process remains unclear, although an immunoregulatory role for TLR2 in the recognition of probiotic strains has been described (Hoarau et al. 2006; Zeuthen et al. 2008; Kaji et al. 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 318, "end": 338, "text": "Hoarau et al.
