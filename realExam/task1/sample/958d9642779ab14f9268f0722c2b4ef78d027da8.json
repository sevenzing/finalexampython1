Objectives Assess cerebral autoregulation using NIRS in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. Methods We included 20 patients admitted with septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). The ICU is a 31-bed mixed medical-surgical unit affiliated with the University of British Columbia. We excluded patients with acute or chronic neurological disorders, end stage liver disease, long-term dialysis, and those admitted following a cardiac arrest.

It is likely that muscle mass in these patients diminishes over the hospital admission, yet this has not previously been quantified. Ultrasonography may provide a useful measure of changes in muscle size over the hospital stay. Objectives To quantify changes in ultrasound-derived quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT) and establish the feasibility of repeated ultrasound examinations throughout the entire hospitalisation of patients with a TBI. Methods Adult patients with a moderate-severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale 3-12) consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a single trauma referral centre over 12 months were eligible following informed consent. Ultrasounds of QMLT at the midpoint and two-thirds between the anterior superior iliac spine and top of the patella were conducted weekly during admission. Data were censored at 3-months and are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. Results Thirty-three patients [45. 4 (16.6) years; 88 % male; 55 % severe TBI; Trauma Injury Severity Score 0.5 (0.3); median APACHE II 18 (IQR: 14-22); admission body mass index 27.2 (6.5) kg/m 2 ] were studied. Primary injury cause was vehicular (58 %) and 67 % of TBIs were multi-trauma. Median length of ICU and ward-based stay was 13.4 [IQR: 6.5-17.9] and 31. 8 [9.4-52.4 ] days, respectively. At 3-months all patients were alive and four remained in hospital. A total of 123 ultrasounds were taken; 30 (24 %) in ICU and 93 (76 %) on the acute ward, equal to 3.7 ultrasounds per patient. Ultrasounds were not possible at 21 % of time-points in hospital due to patient agitation and 61 % at 3-month follow-up due to inability to attend appointment in person. Twenty-eight (85 %) patients had >1 ultrasound taken during their admission, for which the mean baseline measure was 1.78 (0.72) cm and within patient standard deviation 0.3 cm. Nineteen patients (58 %) had >2 ultrasounds during the hospital admission with a baseline measure of 1.78 (0.68) and proximate measure to discharge of 1.53 (0.52) cm. There was a 6. Conclusions This is the first study to describe longitudinal change in muscle size over the hospital admission in patients with a moderatesevere TBI.

Pattinson 1, 2 Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours (\"early brain injury\") is likely to play a key pathophysiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and noninvasively at the bedside-especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic latency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31-70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines. 1 Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: in the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly prolonged in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 t-test).

The NIRS data was analysed for significant haemodynamic response to SDs. Results In total, three ECoG-confirmed SDs occurred during NIRS monitoring, each in a different patient. Two acute (one minute) hypoperfusion responses were seen after an SD in one patient. One acute (one minute) hyperperfusion response was seen after an SD in one patient. Three subacute (20 minute) hypoperfusion responses were seen across two patients.

After adjusting for APACHE II score the TISS-28 score did not differ between delirious patients and nondelirious patients, (28.4 \u00b1 6 versus 27.2 \u00b1 8, respectively). In addition, no differences in TISS-28 score were found between the delirium subgroups.

Diagnosis of delirium is based on the video by two, or in case of disagreement, three delirium experts (psychiatrists, geriatricians or neurologists) independent of each other, and independent of the EEG recording. EEGs are automatically analysed after artefact removal using waveform analyses, as well as analysis of relative delta power, and compared with the classification of the delirium experts (gold standard), to obtain sensitivity, specificity and the predictive values. Preliminary results: Among 45 patients (75 % men, mean age 76 years, SD 7 years), 5 patients were diagnosed as delirious.

Patients were considered as delirious in case of a positive CAM-ICU and/or at the start of haloperidol prescription on suspicion of delirium.

Conclusions: Fluctuations of serum sodium, including in patients whose sodium remained within the normal range, were independently associated with an increase in 28-day mortality. Severity of dysnatraemia was associated with 28-day mortality. These findings are consistent with previous reports and suggest that minor fluctuations in sodium may be associated with mortality. Introduction: Cv-aCO 2 /Da-vO 2 has been suggested as a marker of adequacy of resuscitation in shock states. A ratio >1 reflects the metabolic tipping point at which CO 2 production exceeds oxygen consumption, akin to the anaerobic threshold in cardiopulmonary exercise testing, but with the advantage of measurement from paired arterial and central venous blood gas analysis. It is of prognostic value in critical care, and in sepsis when combined with lactate [1, 2] . We investigate the role of Cv-aCO 2 /Da-vO 2 in liver resection surgery. Our anaesthetic technique uses fluid restriction, diuresis and venodilation to decrease CVP, which improves outcome [3] . On completion of resection, goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is initiated. This technique provides an ideal model of rapid haemodynamic changes in which to investigate Cv-aCO 2 /Da-vO 2 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2195, "end": 2198, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2199, "end": 2201, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2393, "end": 2396, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A434"}, {"text": "Objectives: To establish: 1) Is there a relationship between perioperative Cv-aCO 2 /Da-vO 2 and outcome? 2) If Cv-aCO 2 /Da-vO 2 , inverse CO 2 gap or serum lactate correlate with cardiac output (CO) Methods: This is a subset of data from the prospective observational study MicroHepFlow, investigating microcirculation in liver resection surgery.

Introduction: Intravenous boluses of furosemide are commonly given to critically ill patients to modulate fluid balance 1-3 . However, their effect on urinary output (UO), fluid balance, electrolyte losses and hemodynamics has not been systematically studied. Therefore, we sought to compare UO, fluid balance, electrolyte losses, biochemical, and hemodynamic effects in the six hours before and after the administration of a 40 mg IV bolus of furosemide. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in critically ill patients where the attending clinician had decided to administer a 40 mg bolus of IV furosemide. We collected information on UO, fluid balance, urinary electrolyte losses, serum and urinary creatinine, serum biochemistry, and hemodynamics and compared the 6-hour pre-bolus period with the 6-hour post-bolus period. We performed linear regression analysis to identify predictors of the extent of urinary output response.

There are more quantitative studies then qualitative studies [1] . Most studies conclude that more studies need to be conducted [2] . Other Dutch hospitals struggle with the same problem. Some hospitals enlarged pharmacy service to prepare more medication to decrease nurse's workload. Discussion: Evaluating double check workload, it was less time consuming then expected although the frequency of the check brings more interruptions. Every interruption brings a disturbance to nurse's concentration and work, this could potentially increase patient risk. Therefore the amount of interruptions should be reduced to a minimum. Meanwhile, technology makes giant leaps. This has the potential to replace the double check. BCMA is making progress and is more efficient and foul proof than human checks. Because of the wide spread variety in results its hard to draw further Conclusions: It is even doubtful whether further studies make sense, given the current advances in technology. If available, BCMA technique (combined with CPOE) should be implemented as soon as possible.

Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed. Participants (inclusion criterion: SOFA score \u2265 9) were randomly split into 2 groups, either treated started at the day of admission with sole pPT or pPT with EMS daily. Data of patients treated with standard physiotherapy (sPT) were available from an earlier trial [1] . An open surgical muscle biopsy from the musculus vastus lateralis was obtained at median day 15 of critical illness.

There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and fiber type distribution between the groups. The MCSA for all fiber types of patients with pPT with or without additional EMS were larger than the MCSA of patients with sPT. Compared to pPT alone, additional evoked muscle activation by EMS increases MCSA for type I,IIa and IIb muscle fibers. Data are shown as frequency-distribution histograms. Conclusions: For the first time we show that pPT is associated with reduced skeletal muscle atrophy when compared to sPT. EMS resulted in an additional reduction of muscle atrophy. The histological findings showed reduced muscle atrophy through preventive physiotherapy procedures. Further studies are needed to solidify our findings and to analyze if this reduction in atrophic response can be confirmed on molecular (i.e. analysis of myosin heavy chain, protein homeostasis) and functional levels and improves the long-term outcome of critical ill patients. Objective: Central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (P cva CO 2 ) has demonstrated its prognostic value in critically ill patients suffering from shock, and current expert recommendations advocate for further resuscitation interventions when P cva CO 2 is elevated. P cva CO 2 combination with arterial-venous oxygen content difference (P cva CO 2 /C av O 2 ) seems to enhance its performance when assessing anaerobic metabolism. However, the fact that PCO 2 values might be altered by changes in blood O 2 content (the Haldane effect), has been presented as a limitation of PCO 2 -derived variables. The present study aimed at exploring the impact of the Haldane effect on P cva CO 2 and P cva CO 2 Introduction: Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) has been established to measure cardiac output CO, global end-diastolic volume GEDV and extravascular lung water EVLW. To facilitate interpretation of these data several ratios have been developed, including pulmonary vascular permeability index (defined as EVLW/(0.25*GEDV)) and global ejection fraction ((4*stroke volume)/GEDV). PVPI and GEF have been associated to the aetiology of pulmonary oedema and to systolic cardiac function, respectively. However, several studies showed that the use of femoral venous access results in a marked overestimation of GEDV which also falsely reduces PVPI and GEF. One of these studies suggested a correction formula for femoral venous access that markedly reduces the bias for GEDV (1) . Consequently, the last PiCCO-algorithm requires information about the CVC, and correction for femoral access has been shown. However, two recent studies demonstrated inconsistencies of this algorithm using incorrected GEDV for PVPI (2), but corrected GEDV for GEF.

Introduction: Investigating the use of dynamic haemodynamic parameters, such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), for predicting fluid responsiveness prior to volume expansion has led many scientific discussions lately. Also, according to current consensus statements their use is increasingly recommended in suitable patients [1] . Extended hemodynamic monitoring (EHD) beyond measurement of cardiac filling pressures (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) is still rare. A recent study revealed that only a minor part of critical ill patients are supervised with specific monitoring to assess fluid responsiveness [2] .

Introduction: Influenza infection causes severe morbidity and mortality around the world. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been describe to increases disease severity comparing with seasonal flu viruses. There are limited data comparing clinical differences between influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) infection in critically ill patients. Objectives: Our aim was to analyse the demographic and clinical differences between patients admitted to ICU due to pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza A(H3N2) infection. Methods: Prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in 148 Spanish ICUs from 2009 to 2015. Individuals with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were compared with those infected by influenza A (H3N2). All serotypes were confirmed using RT-PCR at ICU admission. Pa-tients\u00b4demographic, clinical, radiologic features, laboratory values, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) and outcomes were recorded. Discrete variables are expressed as percentage and continuous variables as medians with 25th to 75th interquartile range (IQR). Differences between groups were assessed using the x2 test and the Fisher exact test for categoric variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Results: Of 2898 patients with confirmed influenza infection at ICU admission, 110 were excluded due to influenza B (n = 56) or nonserotype A typification (n = 54). At all, 2421 patients with influenza A (H1N1) were compared to 367 patients with influenza A (H3N2). Patients with A(H1N1) were much younger (50 [38-61] vs 61 [50-73], P < 0.001), presented a higher multiorgan dysfunction (61,2 % vs 55,4 %, P = 0.038), and required more invasive mechanical ventilation (70,6 % vs 65.1 %, P = 0.046), and prone position(18.9 % vs 13.0 %, P = 0.007). Patients with A(H3N2) had more comorbidities: COPD (30.4 % vs 19.5 %, P < 0.001), heart failure(18,6 % vs 10.0 %, P < 0.001), chronic renal failure(14,5 % vs 7,6 %, P < 0.001), and diabetes(23,9 % vs 15,3 %, P < 0.001). Patients with A(H3N2) presented more bacterial coinfection pneumonia (26,5 % vs 14,4 %, P < 0.001) and a higher vaccination rate (23,5 % vs 5,7 %, P < 0.001). Influenza A(H1N1) group have an increased ICU length of stay (LOS) (11 [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] vs 8 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , P < 0.001) but there is no difference in hospital LOS. No statistically significant difference in overall mortality was observed (21.9 % H1N1 vs 24.2 % H3N2, P = 0337). Conclusions: Our data suggest than Infuenza A subtypes have different clinical presentation in critically ill patients. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 affect younger patients with less comorbidities suffering an acute and more severe respiratory disease. Influenza A (H3N2) is presented more frecuently with bacterial coinfection in older patients with more chronic illness and especially CPOD. The overall mortality was high without differences between groups. Introduction: During the past ten years the paradigm of a \"healthy lung is a sterile lung\" was challenged [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .

Introduction: Admission to the ICU deeply impacts on post-ICU mortality and quality of life, but the information on the issue is still scarce(1). Objectives: To analyze epidemiological data and evolution of patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) in the ICU and to define independent variables associated to long-term (1 year) mortality. Methods: National, prospective, multicenter cohort study sponsored by the Argentinian Society of Intensive Care Medicine, including patients receiving MV >72 hr (3/5-8/31/2014). Epidemiological and evolution variables were recorded, and after hospital discharge patients/their relatives were interviewed face-to-face or by telephone at 2, 6 and 12 months.

Objectives: Because the outcome of adult patients with dengue infections requiring ICU admissions remains unclear, this study was conducted to assess the clinical manifestations and the prognostic factors of critical ill patients with severe dengue. Methods: This study was conducted in a tertiary referral hospital of 96 adult ICU beds. In this retrospective study, all of the patients with laboratory-confirmed severe dengue infections and admitted to ICU were enrolled between July 31 and November 31 in 2015 during the large outbreak period. The medical records of all the recruited patients were retrospectively reviewed and the following information was collected: age, gender, clinical manifestations, disease severity scores, underlying conditions, laboratory examinations, and outcome. The primary endpoint is to find the predictors of in-hospital mortality. Results: During study period, there were a total of 4787 patients with dengue infections, and 143 (2.99 %) patients with severe dengue infection required ICU admission. Among 143 critically ill patients, their mean age was 69.7 years. Hypertension (n = 90, 62.9 %) and diabetes mellitus (n = 70, 49.0 %) were the two most common underlying diseases. Eighty patients (55.9 %) had co-bacterial infections, and 33 patients had co-bacteremia. Hematologic system was the most common failure organ, followed by chest and cardiovascular systems. Fever was the most common presentation (n = 112, 78.3 %), followed by anorexia (n = 47, 32.9 %), and abdominal pain (n = 46, 32.2 %). Overall, a total of 33 patients had mortality, and the rate of mortality was 23.1 %. In multivariate analysis, we found that in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with lower Glasgow coma scale, lower platelet count before ICU discharge, and higher number of organ failures. Conclusions: The outcome of severe dengue patients requiring ICU admission remains high and the mortality was associated with lower Glasgow coma scale, lower platelet counts and more organ failures. Additionally, more than half of patients would have bacterial infections during severe dengue infections. Introduction: Critical illness is marked by hypermetabolism and increased protein catabolism.

All patients underwent a Registered Dietitian formal assessment within 48 hours of ICU admission. The exposure of interest, grams of protein per kilogram body weight delivered per day, was determined from all oral, enteral and parenteral sources for up to 28 days. Nutrition status was categorized as non-specific malnutrition, protein-energy malnutrition, or at risk for malnutrition via anthropometric measurements, clinical signs of malnutrition, malnutrition risk factors, and metabolic stress. The primary outcome was all cause 90-day post-discharge mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by mixed-effects logistic regression models to describe how 90-day post-discharge mortality differed with changes in protein delivery. Conclusions: In adult MICU patients who survive to hospital discharge, protein intake appears to be predictive of out of hospital outcomes. Patients with improvements in protein intake during hospitalization independent of energy intake have decreased mortality in the 3 months following hospital discharge. The achievement of ideal protein delivery may be an important factor in ICU survivorship, especially in malnutrition.

Several mechanisms and risk factors have been described to explain this syndrome. Glucocorticoids, which are frequently used in ICU, induce muscle atrophy, but the mechanism still remains to be elucidated. Connexin based hemichannels (Cx HCs), are channels formed by six connexin proteins and communicates the intra with extra cellular space since they are permeable to ions and small molecules (e.g., ATP). Recently, CxHCs have been associated to denervationinduced skeletal muscle atrophy (1), and may also participate in the pathogenesis of corticoids induced muscle atrophy. Objectives: To evaluate the possible involvement of Cx HCs in dexamethasone-induced muscular atrophy. Methods: C57Bl/6 wild type (WT) mice and Cx HCs knock out (KO) mice (Cx43fl/flCx45fl/fl and Cx43fl/flCx45fl/fl:Myo-Cre) mice were used. KO mice were skeletal muscle deficient for connexin 43 and 45. Also, Lanthanum, a connexin blocker, was used in experiments. Presence and functionality of Cx HCs was evaluated acutely after 5 hours of dexamethasone exposure, by cellular Ethidium uptake, Evans blue permeability, intracellular free Ca2+, resting membrane potential, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. NFkb Phosphorylation and mRNA levels of TNF-alpha were also assessed. Finally, muscle atrophy was evaluated by cross sectional area (CSA) after 7 days of dexamethasone exposure.

Accordingly, a significant increase in basal intracellular free Ca2+ levels, and a decrease of resting membrane potential of about 10 mV, was observed in myofibers from WT mice treated with dexamethasone compared with mice injected with saline buffer or in KO mice. Moreover, dexamethasone induced the phosphorylation of NFkb and increased the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha.

Methods: We assessed 48 consecutive septic patients admitted to our medico-surgical ICU. Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were determined on day 1. APACHE II was calculated on day 1, and daily SOFA score was calculated for 5 consecutive days, determining also the maximum SOFA.

APACHE II, SOFA scores on days 1 and 2, and maximum SOFA, also showed no correlation with 28-day mortality. However, when analyzing SOFA scores on days 3, 4 and 5, we found significant lower scores in survivors compared to non-survivors: SOFA-3 (p = 0.048), SOFA-4 (p = 0.016), and SOFA-5 (p = 0.018). The ROC curve analysis also showed association with 28-day mortality: SOFA-3 (AUC 0.772, p = 0.048), and stronger for SOFA-4 (AUC 0.823, p = 0.019), and SOFA-5 (AUC 0.820, p = 0.021). Conclusion: Day 1 values for procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, APACHE II and SOFA did not correlate with outcome. But, low SOFA scores on day 3, and specially in days 4 and 5, are good predictors of survival, meaning that after 48 hours of admission, regardless of the initial score, those patients with a low SOFA score have higher probability to survive. While SOFA scores at admission, and maximum SOFA, had bad performance in predicting mortality, sequential SOFA scores add information on the course of the disease, and improve the ability to predict the likelihood of survival. Larger studies are required to find out SOFA based prediction models with improved accuracy. Predictors of hospital mortality were identified by backwards binary logistic regression in a derivation cohorts separately for each severity group. Performance of models was tested in validation cohorts. Models were then fitted with the selected predictors for the different severities in all cases and predicted mortality risk was calculated.

Introduction: Recent guidelines on the definition of sepsis from the Sepsis 3 working group have suggested the use of a simplified version of the SOFA score as an initial way to screen for sepsis (1) . This score allocates a point each for new altered mentation (GCS < 15), respiratory rate greater than 22 and a systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg. It has been given the term qSOFA based on the original SOFA (sepsis related organ failure assessment). The purpose of the score is to identify patients early with sepsis as dealy in recognition is associated with an increased mortality and increased length of stay. We decided to evaluate whether the qSOFA score when applied to ICU patients could be validated for use in our patient population. Methods: A historical patient cohort was identified by searching the WardWatcher CIS dataset for all patients admitted from 01/01/204 -31/12/2014 to a five bedded teaching hospital Intensive Care Unit in Glasgow. These patients demographic data was collected along with the parameters from qSOFA (as above) along with outcome data.

Introduction: Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill and may be secondary to either diabetes (recognised or not), or stress induced hyperglycaemia. Stress induced hyperglycaemia occurs in patients who have normal glucose tolerance following resolution of their acute illness. Whether stress induced hyperglycaemia unmasks latent insulin resistance and/or impaired \u03b2-cell function has not been adequately explored. Objectives: To evaluate the association between stress induced hyperglycaemia, the development of diabetes and long-term mortality in survivors of critical illness. Methods: This is a retrospective, multi-centre observational study. All adult patients surviving admission to a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) in South Australia between 2004 and 2011 were included. Stress induced hyperglycaemia was defined as a blood glucose \u2265 11.1 mmol/l within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Prevalent diabetes was identified through ICD-10 coding or prior registration with the Australian National Diabetes Service Scheme (NDSS). Incident diabetes was identified as NDSS registration > 30 days after hospital discharge until July 2015. The predicted risk of developing diabetes was described as sub-hazard ratios using competing risk regression. Survival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: Stress induced hyperglycaemia was identified in 2,883 (17 %) of 17,074 patients without diabetes. The overall incidence of subsequent type 2 diabetes following critical illness was 4.8 % (821 of 17,074). The risk of diabetes in patients with stress induced hyperglycaemia was approximately double that of those without (HR 1.91 (95 % CI 1.62, 2.26), p < 0.001) and was sustained regardless of age or severity of illness. Subdividing age into approximate deciles the greatest risk was seen in the 50-59 year age group with over a seven-fold risk (HR 7.90 (5.38, 11.60), p < 0.001). Stress induced hyperglycaemia was not associated with increased long-term mortality in patients who survived their hospital admission.

Introduction: Although several clinical guidelines recommend maintaining blood glucose between 144 and 180 mg/dL, these are insufficient evidences to assess the benefit and harm of this glycemic target. Objectives: We conducted a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of glycemic target 144-180 mg/dL on the incidence of hypoglycemia, the risk of infection and mortality in compared with other glycemic target as < 110 mg/dL, 110-144 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL. Methods: We considered all studies from three recent systematic reviews [1] [2] [3] and searched the PubMed database for studies that compared target blood glucose levels among critically ill patients. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the incidence of hypoglycemia, and risk of sepsis or bloodstream infection. Results: We identified 71 studies through the re-analysis of the three systematic reviews, and 431 studies through the PubMed search. Thirtynine potentially eligible studies were considered for inclusion, although 12 studies were excluded after screening the full texts. Thus, the network meta-analysis included 14,495 patients from 27 studies. The mean patient age was 61.6 years, and 21.7 % of the patients had diabetes. There was no significant difference of in-hospital mortality and risk of sepsis or bloodstream infection among 3 glycemic bands (<110 mg/dL, 110-144 mg/dL and 144-180 mg/dL). Target blood glucose levels of 144-180 mg/dL had significantly lower in-hospital mortality and risk of sepsis or bloodstream infection in compared with >180 mg/dL (odds ratio [OR]:0.82, 95 % credible intervals [CI]: 0.69-0.96; OR: 0.69, 95 % CI: 0.52-0.92, respectively). Our network meta-analysis revealed that target blood glucose levels of < 110 mg/dL and 110-144 mg/dL were associated with a 6-7 fold higher risk of hypoglycemia, compared to targets of 144-180 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL. There were no significant differences in the risk of hypoglycemia between < 110 mg/dL and 110-144 mg/dL (OR = 0.76 (95 % CI: 0.49-1.11).

Introduction: Diabetes is a risk factor for the development and severity of critical illness, and the need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Despite this, diabetes does not confer a greater risk of death for those with critical illness within the index hospital admission. However, long-term outcomes in patients with diabetes who survive ICU admission remain unknown. Objectives: Our objectives were to evaluate the effect of diabetes on both long-term survival rates and average years of life lost for patients admitted to ICU and who survived hospitalisation. Methods: We evaluated all adult patients in South Australia between 2004 and 2011 who survived hospitalisation requiring admission to a Public Hospital ICU. Demographic and admission data from the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database were linked to population based datasets to match (i) International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes for diabetes through the Department of Health Integrated South Australian Activity Collection dataset, (ii) diabetes diagnosis in the national register (the National Diabetes Service Scheme), and (iii) mortality through the Australian National Death Index. Life years lost were calculated using age and sex specific life-tables from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Data are presented as frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) or median [interquartile range] for continuous variables. Between group comparisons were performed by t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-square tests. Longitudinal survival was analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression and average life years lost by linear regression. Results: 5451 patients with and 17022 patients without diabetes were included. Patients with diabetes were older (64.7 (14.9) vs 57.6 (19.7) years; p < 0.0001) and had higher illness severity on admission to ICU ( Introduction: Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used to estimate chronic glycemic control. Recently, several studies suggested that the optimal glycemic control in acutely ill patients might be better being adjusted according to the premorbid chronic glycemic control (1-3). However, the majority of patients would not have been measured the HbA1c-level prior to the acute illness. As the HbA1c-level would be affected by the patients' conditions, HbA1c-levels during an acute illness may not reflect the actual premorbid glycemic status. Only limited research has been conducted so far to assess the value of HbA1c-levels during the state of an acute illness to estimate the premorbid glycemic control (4). Objectives: Assessment of the relationship between HbA1c during the state of an acute illness and HbA1c levels measured within 30 days before an acute illness. Methods: These are retrospective observational studies. The Ethics Committee of the Kobe University Hospital approved this investigation. The committee waived the need for informed consent concerning studies involving the use of databases. We screened patients' HbA1c levels that were measured within 30 days prior to an emergency surgery, requiring general anesthesia. Among them, we selected patients whose HbA1c levels were also measured on the day of the surgery. Thus we obtained HbA1c-levels measured within 30 days before the emergency surgery (preHbA1c) and on the day of the surgery (opeH-bA1c). Those HbA1c-levels were measured in the same laboratory. The correlations of the two HbA1c levels were assessed, using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

Introduction: Hypoglycaemia during ICU admission is associated with adverse outcomes after discharge. In both health and patients with diabetes, acute hypoglycaemia triggers counter-regulatory responses increasing cardiac contractility and accelerating gastric emptying. However, antecedent hypoglycaemia attenuates endogenous catecholamine and vagal responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia 1 . Accordingly, patients who were hypoglycaemic during ICU may be unable to mount a physiological response to hypoglycaemia once discharged from ICU. Objectives: To determine the effects of antecedent hypoglycaemia on cardiac and gastric responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia in health. Methods: Ten healthy men (age 22.5 (1.0) years, BMI 23.8 (0.5) kg/m 2 ) were studied on two occasions, lasting 30 hours, separated by \u2265 6 weeks and randomised to either 'control' (Day 1 ( C1 ) -three euglycaemic clamps at a blood glucose of 6 mmol/L followed day 2 ( C2 ) -one hypoglycaemic clamp at 2.8 mmol/L), or 'antecedent hypoglycaemia' (Day 1 ( AH1 ) -three clamps at blood glucose of 2.8 mmol/L followed by day 2 ( AH2 ) -one clamp at 2.8 mmol/L). Cardiac contractility was measured using fractional shortening (FS) via 2D echocardiography on days 1 and 2 of the control (FS C1 and FS C2 ) and antecedent hypoglycaemia (FS AH1 and FS AH2 ) periods. Gastric emptying (GE) was measured on day 1 and day 2, for both control (GE C1 and GE C2 ) and antecedent hypoglycaemia (GE AH1 and GE AH2 ) study periods, using scintigraphy, following ingestion of a standardised meal consisting of 100 g of minced beef labelled with 20 MBq 99m technetium-sulphur colloid. Radioisotopic data were acquired for 180 minutes. Data are mean (SE). Results: Fractional shortening was greater (FS C2 vs. FS C1 , P < 0.01) and gastric emptying faster (GE C2 AUC vs. GE C1 AUC , P = 0.01) during acute, single episode hypoglycaemia compared to euglycaemia. When testing the effect of antecedent hypoglycaemia compared to a single episode of hypoglycaemia, fractional shortening may be attenuated (FS AH2 vs. FS C2 , P = 0.06), whereas gastric emptying was unaffected (GE AH2 AUC vs. GE C2 AUC , P = 0.74) (Figs. 40 and 41). Conclusions: In health, the increase in cardiac contractility during acute hypoglycaemia may be affected by antecedent hypoglycaemia whereas acceleration of gastric emptying during acute hypoglycaemia does not appear to be affected by antecedent was unaffected. These data suggest that antecedent hypoglycaemia during ICU may have \"downstream\" effects after discharge. Introduction: Plasmatic acid-base equilibrium remains a confusing area more than a century after the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation publication. However, a consensus exists concerning arterial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO 2 ) that would represent respiratory part of this equilibrium 1 . Stewart described this parameter as \"independent\", in contrast to \"dependent\" parameters, e.g. pH and HCO 3 \u2212 2 . Objectives: The primary objective of this experimental trial is to demonstrate that lactic acid infusion increase pCO 2 . This would be inconsistent with Stewart approach. Methods: After local ethical committee approval, 9 anesthetized, curarized and mechanically ventilated piglets were studied. Lactic acid infusion (0.33 mmol.kg \u22121 .min \u22121 ) was administered. Each 3 minutes, an arterial gasometry was done. Each minute, the following parameters were collected: mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output measured by transpulmonary thermodilution (CO), pulse oxymetry (SpO 2 ) and end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2 ). Bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) was calculated like this: HCO 3 \u2212 = 0.03*pCO 2 *10 pH-6.1", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions:"}, {"text": ". Total CO 2 (tCO 2 ) was calculated like this: tCO 2 = HCO 3 \u2212 + 0.03*pCO 2 The primary endpoints were pCO 2 increase and tCO 2 stability. To test the hypothesis of normal distribution, Shapiro Wilk test was applied. The p values were obtained from ANOVA analyses. p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The results were: a decrease in pH (p < 0.001) (Fig. 42a) , an increase in pCO 2 (p = 0.002) (Fig. 42b) , a decrease in HCO 3 \u2212 (p = 0.015) (Fig. 42d ) without significant alteration in tCO 2 (p = 0.08) (Fig. 42c ). We also observed: an increase in EtCO 2 (p = 0.001) (Fig. 42e ) and lactatemia (p < 0.001) (Fig. 42f ). CO (p = 0.052), MAP (p = 0.506) and SpO2 (p = 0.905) were not significantly altered. Conclusions: This in vivo metabolic acidosis model with stable minute ventilation shows an increase in pCO 2 without significant alteration in tCO 2 . Although these results were biochemically predictable, they question one of the basements of Stewart approach, that considered pCO 2 as an independent parameter.

Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that a more liberal glycemic control (target blood glucose level between 10 and 14 mmol/l) may be beneficial in patients with diabetes adapted to chronic hyperglycemia (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] >7 %) 1 . However, whether such liberal strategies leads to relative insulin deficiency, accelerated ketone body production and ketoacidosis is uncertain. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective observational study to explore the incidence of ketosis, ketonuria and ketoacidosis during liberal glucose management of critically ill diabetic patients. Methods: We studied 60 critically ill diabetic patients treated according to a liberal glucose protocol targeting a blood glucose level (BGL) between 10-14 mmol/l.

However, there was no significant difference in severity or prevalence of ketonemia and ketonuria among patients with BGL above (permissive hyperglycemia) or below 10 mmol/l.

The management of blood glucose was performed from immediately after admission to the ICU for two research days. The patients were randomly assigned to control blood glucose levels with the STG-55 group (n = 16) or sliding scale method, SS group (n = 12). The usefulness of blood glucose management defined the incidence of hyperglycemia (blood glucose > 180 mg/dL), hypoglycemia (<80 mg/dL), and the maximum glycemic variability (maximum blood glucose level minus minimum blood glucose level).

We also analyzed the different types and doses of analgesic and sedation drugs (morphine, fentanyl, remifentanyl, propofol and midazolam) and the different strategies used (bolus administration, increase of the infusion rate or both).

There were no statistical differences regarding the different types and doses of analgesia and sedation, and the different strategies used in group A vs group B (Table 23 and Fig. 46 ). Although none of the following reached statistical significance we found that the number of patients receiving doses described as superior to standard accounted for an important percentage in both groups, and that there was a higher rate of bolus administration followed by an increase in infusion rate un group B (53,3 %) when compared to group A (29,4 %). Conclusion: In our study we found no differences in dose, type and strategy applied for analgesia and sedation after TE regardless of whether the patient was a potential organ donor or not.

ACP is increasingly recognized as area of concern respecting quality of care in the ICU and other wards in the hospital.

Introduction: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) can be divided in hypoxemic or hypercapnic, depending on the leading modification in blood gas analysis, being the first one the most common. Mechanical Ventilatory Support is one of the treatment mainstays of patients in the Intensive Care Units (ICU), either as management for a primary respiratory imbalance or to protect the airway. Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) is defined as any method in which positive pressure is delivered by a face mask or any other interphase without the use of an endotracheal tube. Objetives: It is well established in which pathologies NIMV can be useful, but an inadequate patient selection may cause an increment in morbidity and mortality as well as a delay in endotracheal intubation. While the aim in most studies is to determine which pathologies NIMV will have a better outcome, the main objective in our study was to define whether the blood gas values (pH, paCO 2 and paO 2 ) are the ones that may indicate which patients are better suited for NIMV. Methods: Retrospective observational study of all adult patients admitted to the ICU (mixed ICU) between March 2014 and April 2016 but data presented in this abstract is a preliminary report as we pretend to add more patients in the ongoing months. Patients with DNR order were excluded as well as patients that required endotracheal intubation in the first 2 hours after the beginning of NIMV. Patient's data was analyzed with the purpose of finding cutoff points in blood gas values that could suggest which patients had a better outcome. Patients divided in two groups (survivors or non-survivors) and mean values were compared using Student's t test.

Of all, n = 15 (29 %) required endotracheal intubation; overall mortality rate was 23.1 % (n = 12). Patients who survived had higher PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio than those who did not (p = 0.04) and tend towards higher PaCO 2 levels although p values were not statistically significant (p = 0.07).

However, there is still concern among patients and physicians that brand-name drugs are more efficient than generic drugs (1 Objectives: The objectives of this audit were to assess the median level of sedation in ventilated patients, record any variation in score at different times of day or night and measure the frequency of recorded score. This audit was then repeated to measure any improvement in practice. Methods: All patients sedated and ventilated during July 2015 were audited and then re-audited in November 2015. Patients were excluded if it was felt that reducing the level of sedation was inappropriate. Results: 300 scores were obtained during July 2015 and 672 in November 2015. The median sedation score was \u22122 in July and \u22123 in November. 41.5 % were too heavily sedated at \u22123 or below in July and 53.3 % in November. The majority of scores were recorded frequently with 84 % of patients in July having a score recorded at least every 2 hours and 91 % in November. Conclusions: Sedation scores are being recorded frequently, with few long gaps for either month. Sedation protocols should be used in order to target the lowest possible levels of sedation. There should be discussion around whether targets should be different at night compared with daytime. There has been no improvement in sedation practice in November compared with July 2015. Fewer than half (45.5 %) of patients were sedated to optimum levels in July and this fell to 38.2 % in November. There may be merit in maintaining an infusion of the opioid, whilst reducing or stopping the hypnotic, rather than stopping both completely. Maintaining staff awareness of the benefits of optimising sedation is prudent. Introduction: The management of severe Legionella pneumonia can include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to rescue those patients which develop refractory hypoxemia or extreme respiratory acidosis. However, some physicians remain skeptical about this approach, considering that evidence is very weak and only derived from case series from single ECMO centers. We believe that reporting experience from diverse centers is important to expand the knowledge and the predictors of benefit from ECMO support in patients with Legionella pneumonia. Objectives: Clinical, physiological, functional and biomechanical characterization of a population with severe Legionella pneumonia treated with extracorporeal life support in a ELSO recognized ECMO centre. Methods: Protocol-driven prospective registration and analysis of data from a population of 9 patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Legionella infection, with additional respiratory physiology evaluation and characterization during the ECMO run treatment. Results: From 2013 to 2015, nine patients with Legionella pneumonia and severe ARDS have failed conventional mechanical ventilation and were treated with extracorporeal oxygenation (Quadrox HLS or PLS Oxygenator System from Maquet). Median age was 46.6 \u00b1 12.3 and all patients were male. ECMO criteria admission were hypoxemia (median pre-ECMO PaO2:FiO 2 of 73.5 \u00b1 22.9 mmHg) associated with respiratory acidosis (median pre-ECMO PaCO 2 of 69,6 \u00b1 12,5 mmHg and pH of 7.22 \u00b1 0,08). Murray score was 3.17 \u00b1 0,16 and SAPS II was 43.7 \u00b1 9.8. Symptoms to cannulation was 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 days, which represented a very early strategy to ECMO implementation. Initial static compliance was 25.9 \u00b1 7.6 ml/cmH 2 O, did not changed significantly by day four (27.7 \u00b1 13,4), and improved to 38.1 \u00b1 13.4 by day seven. Six patients were smokers, six had acute kidney injury AKIN 3 and three had circulatory shock. During ECMO run, all patients were additionally conventionally ventilated with a lung rest strategy (Vt 2.0 ml/kg, driving pressure below 15 cmH 2 O and PEEP of 10 to 14 mmHg). Seven patients were treated with azithromycin and two patients with levofloxacin. We did not prescribed corticosteroids in any patient.

Introduction: Percutaneous Tracheostomy is a procedure commonly performed in the intensive care unit 1 , being considered as first choice in patients in critical condition due to the lower rate of complications associated with this procedure 2 , reports of perioperative complications ranging from 2 to 6 % 3 such as bleeding, death, false passage, extubating, pneumothorax, emphysema, hypertension and inability to perform the technique; Postoperative complications were reported from 9 to 17 % 3 , including bleeding, displaced tube, pneumothorax, infection and death. In our intensive care unit we have one year experience of performing percutaneous tracheostomy, with very low rate of complications so far.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in our intensive care unit during March of 2015 to February of 2016, counting 23 patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy for any indication, and the complications observed in each procedure were recorded in a data collection sheet. Results: We obtained a population of 23 patients, 11 females and 12 males, all diagnoses of these patients were divided into groups, including 9 patients with lung disease (39.2 %), 7 patients with neurological disease (30.4 %), and 7 patients with abdominal disease (30.4 %), with an average of 8.47 days of mechanical ventilation, and an average of 15.4 minutes duration of the percutaneous tracheostomy, in which 2 episodes of extubating without clinical repercussion as perioperative complications were reported (8.9 %), and a tube displacement which required endotracheal intubation as a postoperative complication (2.3 %). Conclusions: We observed a low incidence of perioperative complications in our patient population, as well as a very low incidence of postoperative complications compared with that reported in the reviewed articles, no serious complications in any patient who perform percutaneous tracheostomy were observed.

Pre-existing arteriosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, systolic heart failure, thrombophilia and characteristics of the ICU admission and treatment (operative admission, higher SAPS II score without age and renal points, use of vasoactives and severe sepsis) did not independently associate with an increased hazard for three-year mortality. In the sensitivity analyses, AKI was not associated with an increased hazard for three-year mortality. Conclusions: Our findings imply that increased long-term mortality among patients with AKI who survive critical illness is not related to AKI per se, but rather to increased age and pre-existing comorbidities.

Conclusions: There are numerous barriers to the provision of renal replacement therapy in neurointensive care patients. This survey has not explored the physiological problems encountered with RRT in these patients, but has highlighted that the maintenance of training, competency and logistical problems sometimes affects the consistent, direct availability of RRT to NICU patients. This is especially true of units without traumatic brain injury patients, where medical staff may become deskilled in the practice of RRT over time. It also highlights the logistical challenges in providing renal replacement therapy in patients who are at high risk of intracranial bleeding without point of care testing immediately available to monitor the anticoagulation of the circuit. Introduction: Septic shock is associated with a severe cardiovascular stress response. Beta-blockade represents a novel way of addressing this; esmolol titrated to keep heart rate < 95 bpm in critically ill patients receiving high-dose noradrenaline resulted in improved outcomes [1] . We measured a series of biomarkers of cardiac stress and injury in an observational study of critically ill patients with septic shock. We then used a long-term fluid-resuscitated rat model of sepsis to assess the same cardiac markers.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1275, "end": 1278, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BIOMARKERS FOR AKI A547"}, {"text": "Objectives.

Methods: Study 1: Observational study of 27 critically ill patients with septic shock from faecal peritonitis or community-acquired pneumonia. Daily measurements of cTnT and BNP were performed on days 0 to 3 (measured by ELISA). Study 2: Awake, instrumented yet fully mobile male Wistar rats (350 \u00b1 50 g) received an intraperitoneal injection of faecal slurry to induce sepsis. Fluid resuscitation (crystalloid 10 ml/kg/h) was commenced at 2 h. At 6 h, an echo-measured stroke volume rate cut-off of 0.20 ml was used to classify animals into predicted survivors (S) or nonsurvivors (NS) (n = 6 per group). Blood was sampled at 6 h and 24 h for cTnT and BNP (ELISA). Control animals were treated identically except for faecal slurry injection. Results were analysed using two-way ANOVA and post-hoc testing and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: cTNT was significantly elevated in critically ill patients on the day of ICU admission, and was significantly higher in NS (Fig. 55) . BNP was significantly elevated in NS patients only. Likewise, in the experimental model of sepsis (Fig. 56) , non-surviving rats had an early elevation of the same cardiac biomarkers. (p < 0.05 for both cTnT and BNP compared to survivors). Conclusions: Sepsis is associated with excess cardiac stress, as demonstrated in both a critically ill patient population and in a rat model of faecal peritonitis.

Hyperoxia has hemodynamic effects, including an increase in systemic vascular resistance suggesting arteriolar vasoconstriction.

Introduction: The mechanisms of persistent hyperlactemia during endotoxic shock are probably multifactorial. Both hypoperfusionrelated anaerobic production and adrenergicdriven aerobic generation have been implicated. More recently an early and severe impairment in exogenous lactate clearance has also been described [1] . Theoretically, an excessive adrenergic response could influence all these mechanisms and thus aggravate the problem. Some small experimental and clinical studies have shown favorable effects on heart rate and hemodynamic or perfusion parameters, and also in inflammatory and metabolic parameters with beta-blockers. Esmolol (ESM) a short-acting selective beta-blocker has demonstrated to improve cardiac contractibility and vascular reactivity probably in relation to an anti-inflammatory effect. In a randomized-controlled study in stable septic shock patients, esmolol reduced heart rate (HR), decreased fluid requirements and lactate levels, and surprisingly showed a significant effect on mortality.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 620, "end": 623, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Objectives: To assess the effects of ESM on lactate production and exogenous lactate clearance in an endotoxic shock model.

Not surprisingly we found a high correlation between dynEl and Ea.In those also receiving vasopressor therapy similar changes occurred. Introduction: Persistent hyperlactatemia after initial septic shock resuscitation is associated with bad prognosis. However, at least three mechanisms are involved: anaerobic glycolysis in hypoperfused tissues, adrenergic-driven aerobic glycolysis and impaired lactate clearance. Only the first mechanism is sensitive to further resuscitation. Thus pursuing lactate normalization with additional fluids while confronted to non-hypoxic causes could lead to the toxicity of overresuscitation with no clinical benefit. To develop clinical algorithms aimed at differentiating hypoxic vs non-hypoxic profiles could have relevant clinical consequences. We hypothetized that a multimodal perfusion monitoring will aid in this purpose, since the presence of low ScvO 2 , or increased central venous-arterial pCO 2 gradient, or an impaired peripheral perfusion together with hyperlactatemia might identify a hypoxic-related phenotype. This phenotype could be associated with worse outcomes as compared with a non-hypoxic profile.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Objectives: To address this subject we perfomed a proof-of-concept retrospective study to assess if this approach can effectively differentiate two clinical phenotypes among hyperlactatemic septic shock patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients with septic shock admitted to our ICU during the calendar year of 2014.

The principal cause of death was stroke (haemorrhagic or ischemic). Fifteen patients (62.5 %) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the other nine (37,5 %) were not considerer by their primary care team as subsidiary of ICU care or as potential donors. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, six died in brain dead and nine after circulatory dead. Four of the deceased patients in brain dead were real donors and five in the circulatory death group [37,5 % (n = 9) absolute donation rate]. Of the nine patients not admitted, only one had medical contraindications for donation (33,3 % of potential donors). In order to prepare for the intervention period, the data were analysed and shared with the different medical teams involved in the care of these patients and an algorithm was elaborated in order to identify the potential donors.

Programs aimed to spread the knowledge regarding the role of these patients as potential donors, and the creations of pathways and protocols to activate the transplant coordination team could be fundamental to increase the number of available organs.

Introduction: In recent years there have been major advances in renal transplantation, including postoperative management, reflected in decreased in-hospital mortality. However, it remains a complex procedure in a group of patients with high comorbidity. Acute graft failure is one of the most common complications, increased in recent years due to non-heart beating donors (NHBD). Bedside ultrasound and radioisotope imaging tests are routinely used during postoperative management in ICU. Objectives: To analyze the concordance of renal doppler ultrasound (RDU) performed at bedside and radioisotopes tests after renal transplantation. Evaluate delayment in renal function in NHBD. Methods: Retrospective, observational study from 2013 to 2014. Inclusion criteria: patients admitted in the ICU in the postoperative of renal transplantation. Variables: Demographic information, type of donation, analytical values, diuresis and bleeding during the ICU stay, results of the imaging tests (ultrasound resistance index less than 0.7 and good perfusion in scintigraphy), transfusion, creatinine levels at discharge, days of hospitalization in the ICU and mortality. Descriptive statistical analysis using U of Mann-Whitney test for differences between groups and Kappa test for the agreement between flow tests. Results: 172 patients were included in our study. 62 % were male. The median age was 52 (RI 41-61) years old. Characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 34 . The median time of ICU stay was 1 day (RI 1-2). No deaths were registered. Agreement between imaging tests reached a Kappa Index of 0.5 (p < 0.001) (Table 35) . Conclusions: Kidney transplantation postoperative has a short length of stay at the ICU. Renal grafts from un-controlled NHBD showed a delay in the improvement of kidney function compared with other types of donors. A medium agreement between RDU and scintigraphy was observed. Introduction: Survival following critical illness is improving and the focus is moving towards optimisation of recovery. However, rehabilitation is poorly understood and national guidance recommends the need for information to be delivered to patients and their carers in an appropriate way (NICE CG83, 2009). In order to demonstrate adherence to national guidance and improve the patients' and their carers' awareness about rehabilitation in the acute phase of recovery following critical illness, this project aimed to develop, implement and evaluate an information booklet on rehabilitation after critical illness. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of introducing an information booklet on compliance with CG83 standards. Methods: A three stage approach was used. Firstly, current evidence was critiqued to identify the important and required informational needs. This information was then used to design and develop the information booklet by the author. This was then introduced and evaluated for a period of 8 weeks. Compliance with NICE CG83 was analysed using the guideline specific audit tool. A locally produced service evaluation questionnaire and a booklet feedback form were used to generate qualitative and quantitative outcomes. Results: Over the evaluation period the booklet was issued on n = 29 occasions, with n = 13 completing analysis. Following the implementation of the booklet, compliance with NICE guidance (see Table 36 ) improved from 0 % to 100 %. Improvements were made in all but two areas of the service evaluation questionnaire. Out of 53 feedback comments received, 45 were positive.

Introduction: Delirium and Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness are two of the most common sequelae in patients recovered in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [1, 2] . The ABCDE bundle (Awakening and Breathing trials, Choice of sedative and analgesics, Delirium monitoring and Early mobility) is a multicomponent approach effective in preventing these complications [4] . Despite a large amount of literature about the ABCDE bundle is available, a previous attempt of implementation in an Italian environment has never been reported. Objectives: The aim of this study was to implement the ABCDE bundle in a general ICU of a large university hospital in northern Italy. Methods: A multidisciplinary team, consisting of critical care physicians and nurses, reviewed the literature and developed a protocol tailored on the Italian environment. Before the ABCDE bundle was part of the routine practice, education of nurses and physicians has been provided through meetings, reminders and poster that summarized the key steps of the protocol was posted by the patients\u00b4bedside. After the ABCDE bundle was part of the routine practice a quality improvement (QI) program to strengthen the bundle knowledge has been realized: every nurse and physician attended a training course while data about facilitators and obstacles to the bundle implementation was collected. Data about adherence to the protocol has been collected to evaluate the effect of QI program. Results: The ABCDE bundle has been implemented in November 2014. The Early mobility protocol became standard care from March 2015. During the QI program, some hindering factors to the implementation were identified, such as communication issues between team members, lack of resources and low confidence with the protocol. In the first quarter post-implementation 27 % of total patients were mobilized, in the second quarter post-implementation 67 % of total patients were mobilized dangling or out-of-bed. Adverse events related to the bundle were not observed. A year after the initial implementation, the \"F\" phase has begun to be incorporated into everyday practice, with a wider opening hours to relatives and a project of live musicians. Conclusions: Although there is no available data about a previous implementation of the ABCDE bundle in an Italian setting, our experience demonstrate that it is feasible and safe. Further efforts are needed to spread the knowledge of the ABCDE bundle and improve adherence to protocol. Introduction: Myocardial injury, as reflected by elevated plasma cardiac troponin levels, has repeatedly been reported in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but its temporal dynamics have not been systematically studied. Furthermore, although troponin release has been associated with increased mortality, its etiology still remains unknown. Objectives: Our aim was to determine the incidence of troponin release in CAP patients and provide a detailed description of the clinical and pathophysiological setting during which it occurs. Methods: We enrolled consecutive patients admitted with CAP to the intensive care units (ICU) of two tertiary care centers in the Netherlands between January 2011 and May 2015. Patients transferred from another hospital, patients after cardiac arrest, and patients not meeting criteria for organ failure were excluded. Highsensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI, Abbott ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I) was measured daily during the first week. ICU days were categorized into days with troponin release (days followed by a 40 % increase in hs-cTnI on the next day and an absolute rise >26 ng/L), days without troponin release (days followed by a >40 % and >26 ng/L decrease in hs-cTnI, or a value beneath the upper reference limit (URL) of 26 ng/L), and days with possible troponin release (if fulfilling none of these conditions (Table 37) . Furthermore, several extrinsic factors (e.g., acute kidney injury and cardiotoxic medication use) were also associated with troponin release.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 484, "end": 487, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 488, "end": 490, "text": "2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 691, "end": 694, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 4199, "end": 4209, "text": "(Table 37)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "References"}, {"text": "Conclusions: Troponin release occurs in a majority of CAP patients.

Objectives: We hypothesized that milder elevations of bilirubin might be protective and associated to better outcomes. Our secondary outcome is to identify a level of bilirubin with discriminative power either for survival or mortality. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study using our unit database, collecting data from 2008 to 2015, including patients >18 years-old, meeting the criteria for severe sepsis and septic shock according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference. 4 We identified the highest serum bilirubin levels within 72 hours of ICU admission and then stratified into 4 cohorts based on hepatic SOFA cut-off values. SOFA and APACHE II scores were recorded. Results: We analyzed 642 patients. The highest bilirubin level was 25,1 mg/dL. Stratifying in the four cohorts, we found a significant decrease in survival from a bilirubin \u22651,2 (OR from 2 to 7,2 (p < 0,001)) with the highest impact from moderate increases (Wald score of 26) (graphic 1). Patients with >11,9 mg/dL had a mean survival of 3 days. There was also a significant difference in severity scores, renal function, liver enzymes and lactate values between the groups, which was analyzed in a Logistic regression. There was no significant difference for UCI-days and length of mechanical ventilation. Discussion: We found hyperbilirubinemia to be independently associated with increased risk of death but no difference in other outcomes, in this population. Despite a lower mortality rate, moderate elevations were not protective but were found to have a higher predictive weight to ICU mortality. We ponder if the protective role of mild elevations, might be true only for patients with hyperbilirubinemia over a much longer time frame that critical patients, which should be studied in future prospective studies. Conclusion: Elevated bilirubin levels in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were significantly associated with an increased risk of ICU mortality, but not longer ICU stay and length of mechanical ventilation. The protective role of the stress-induced rise of bilirubin in septic shock, was not proven. Conclusions: Diastolic dysfunction was seen in 90 % of patients. fever, HR, WBC counts still good early indicators for diagnosis of sepsis.Vasopressors withdrawal on 7th day was good predictor for survival. Admission serums IL-6, IL-10 & CRP from PV were better indicators for Sepsis than IL-1, Pro-BNP & Troponin I.admission TNF-\u03b1 & 7th day IL-6 levels were highly prognostic to mortality.CS samples proved that NT Pro-BNP is a good indicator for sepsis diagnosis & a good predictor for survival,TNF-\u03b1 from CS samples was also a good predictor for mortality. SAPS II .A slower E`d/t on admission was good predictor to mortality. Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [2] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. Introduction: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in septic patients. The pathophysiology of SAE is incompletely elucidated. It has been hypothesized that impairment of cerebral autoregulation (CAR) would result in brain hypoperfusion and neuronal damage (1), but previous studies showed conflicting results (2,3). Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate CAR in septic shock patients and test the hypothesis that its alteration is associated with clinical encephalopathy or brain perfusion. Methods: Adult patients diagnosed with septic shock and admitted to the ICU stay were included (July 2015 -March 2016). Exclusion criteria were: intracranial disease; arrythmias; extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation; intra/extra-cranial arteriopathy. Transcranial Doppler (DWL, Germany) was performed insonating left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) with a 2-MHz probe. LMCA blood flow velocity (FV) and arterial blood pressure (BP) signals were simultaneously recorded; Pear-son\u00b4s correlation coefficient between BP and FV (Mxa) was calculated using MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). Impaired CAR was defined as Mxa > 0.3 (4) . 3), PaCO2 level < vs \u2265 40 mmHg (p = 0.9) and presence of encephalopathy (e.g. GCS < 15 on admission) (p = 0.5). Also, no association between Mxa and mean BP or dose of vasopressors was noted. Conclusions: CAR was altered in almost half of the patients with septic shock. No association between autoregulation and clinical encephalopathy or determinants of brain perfusion was found (Table 38) . ICU LOS (days) 8 [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Introduction: Septic shock is a life threatening condition associated with high mortality. Poor outcome is mainly related to the inadequacy between oxygen delivery and cellular demand leading to the onset of multiorgan dysfunction. Whether this multiorgan failure affect the pancreas is not fully investigated [1] . Objective: To assess the prognostic value of increased pancreatic enzymes in patients with septic shock. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in a 12-bed medical surgical intensive care unit. All patients admitted with septic shock were included. Demographic, clinical and biological data were recorded on admission. Serum amylase and lipase levels were checked on day 1 and day 2. All the patients with increased amylase and/or lipase serum level underwent imaging investigations. Quantitative variables were expressed as median [ Conclusion: The increase of pancreatic enzyme is common in patients with septic shock. However, pancreatic injury does not affect the prognosis of these patients. In our center, although promoting the standardization and individualization of sepsis treatment, some patients die. We examined some factors of the patients with sepsis. Objectives: We searched the worse factor of the prognosis of septic patients. Methods: This study was a retrospective observational study in a single center. We studied the patients with sepsis who admitted from the emergency department to the ICU in our hospital. We defined sepsis as patients with SOFA score 2 points worse than sepsis onset before (Sepsis-3 Definition) (3). The study period was from Jan. 2014 to Jun. 2015. Gender, age, APACHE2, SOFA, and KDIGO classification of AKI were checked. Results: The number of patients was 60: non-survivor 18(30 %), and survivor 42(70 %). Table 39 showed the characteristics of each group. Table 40 showed the correlation between KDIGO classification and the prognosis. As APACHE2, SOFA, and KDIGO classification of AKI were bad, life prognosis was bad. Among SOFA score, renal function and respiratory function were well correlated with patients mortality. Conclusions: The acute kidney injury and acute respiratory failure were especially worse prognostic factor among septic patients. is over-activated,causing a consumption of clotting factors until DIC.This extreme condition is associated to a higher mortality.RO-TEM\u00ae, a point-of-care assay based on viscoelastic measurements of coagulation changes in whole blood,could be useful to study the coagulative profiles in patients at risk of DIC [1] .

The T30d animals were considered survivors since the mortality of sepsis S9 is 80 % from 26 hours after induction Results: The histological results show that S-9 sepsis model determines a rapid and progressive liver damage. In the period of T2h, although predominant hepatic aspect of normality was observed, there was the onset of a sinusoidal congestion of focal occurrence, presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the lumen of the vein hepatic centrilobular and by PAS staining was observed the glycogen accumulation in cytoplasm of hepatocytes, except around centrilobular vein. At T6H, there was a generalized sinusoidal congestion, significant polymorphonuclear cells infiltration in the portal area and presence of leukocytes adhering to the endothelium of the centrilobular vein. Besides, was also observed some hepatocytes with shrunken nucleus suggesting apoptotic cell death in progress. PAS showed a overall decrease of glycogen in hepatocytes, suggesting a high consumption of energy due to the exacerbated inflammatory process of sepsis. Twenty four hours post sepsis, the liver was congested, mainly in centrilobular veins, suggestive of increased vascular resistance in the liver. The infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, predominantly in centrilobular and periportal areas suggested the leucocyte invasion into the liver parenchyma and subsequent proinflammatory reaction. PAS staining showed the presence of multiple small vesicles inside the hepatocytes, suggestive of initial degenerative process in progress and this proved to be fat vesicles by Sudan Black staining. In 30 days after sepsis recovery, the sinusoidal spaces were compressed and some congestions were located in the centrilobular vein, moreover, there were liver cell degeneration with pycnosis and hyaline degeneration, suggesting a chronic phase of liver dysfunction. The overall findings demonstrated a multiple liver parenchymal abnormalities in post-sepsis period, suggesting the fragility of the liver physiology to fight against a new infectious challenge. Introduction: The splanchnic reticulo-endothelial system is fundamentally involved in bacterial clearance both via innate and adaptive immune responses. It has e.g. been reported that hyposplenism is associated with an unfavorable outcome in sepsis. We hypothesized that systemic inflammatory response (SIR) induced immunosuppression leads to decreased trans-splanchnic microbial clearance. Objectives: To investigate if pre-existing systemic inflammation affects the splanchnic bacterial clearance. Methods: Fifteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to an infusion of E. coli in a cervical vein for 3 hours. To induce a systemic inflammatory response, group \"EtxPreExp\" (n = 6) received a continuous intravenous endotoxin infusion starting 24 h prior to the E. coli infusion. Group \"UnExp\" (n = 6) received the bacterial infusion without prior endotoxin exposure. To understand the effects of 24 h anesthesia alone, three animals received saline instead of endotoxin for 24 h prior to the bacterial infusion (\"Controls\"). According to the predefined statistical plan, \"Controls\" were not included in the primary analysis. Bacterial counts in arterial and portal venous blood were analyzed hourly during the E. coli infusion, and were corrected for the bacterial dose administered per body weight. Blood samples were analyzed and physiologic parameters were recorded throughout the experiment. Results: All animals receiving endotoxin developed SIR prior to the E. coli infusion. The amounts of administered bacteria were comparable between the groups. There were no differences between EtxPreExp and UnExp groups in log arterial (2.47 (\u00b10.49) vs. 2.38 (\u00b10.57) CFU x mL \u22121 corr ; mean \u00b1 SD) or portal (2.40 (\u00b10.36) vs. 2.11 (\u00b10.77)) bacterial counts at 3 h, just before the end of the bacterial infusion. Furthermore, there was no difference in the ratio of portal vein to arterial bacterial counts between the EtxPreExp and UnExp groups (Fig. 65 ). White blood cell counts (p < 0.001), mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01), base excess (p < 0.05) and pH (p < 0.001) were lower, while arterial lactate levels (p < 0.001) were higher in UnExp vs. EtxPreExp group during and after the E. coli infusion. Conclusions: Our preliminary results show that despite diminished immunologic and physiologic response, induced by pre-existing inflammatory response, the splanchnic bacterial clearance is not affected in E. coli septic shock. Objective: To investigate the effect of biliary tract external drainage (BTED) on liver of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rats and the relationship with heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. Methods: SD rats weighing 250-300 g were randomly assigned into five groups (n = 6): sham surgery (SS) group, SAP group, SAP + BTED group, SAP+ zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) group, SAP + BTED + ZnPP group. The SAP model was induced via retrograde injection of 4 % sodium taurocholate (1 mL/kg) into biliopancreatic duct through duodenalwall. BTED was performed by inserting a cannula into the bile duct of SAP rats. Tissue and blood samples were collected 24 hours after surgery. Pathological changes in organs were scored. The level of amylase, alanine transaminase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum were measured. The expression of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in tissues were analyzed by real-time PCR and western-blot. Results: Liver damage in SAP rats was significantly alleviated by BTED (p < 0.05). Compared to the SAP group, the serum level of amylase, ALT, AST, were significantly lower in the BTED group (p < 0.05). The BETD treatment led to a significant reduction of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 level and a significant increase of HO-1 level in tissues than in SAP rat (p < 0.05). ZnPP significantly inhibited all mentioned effects. Conclusions: BTED protected liver against SAP related injuries via the HO-1 pathway. Objectives: The aim of our observation retrospective study was to test the hypothesis that a correlation exists between percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP (% VP) and the main nursing, severity and outcome indexes in our both medical and surgical ICU served in community hospital.

Introduction: Metered dose bronchodilator inhalation through ventilator circuit has long been used in intubated patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, fixed drug dosage now commonly used has not been endorsed by manufacturers nor proved clinically effective [1] . Evidences suggest drug delivered this way has suboptimal lung deposition [2] . Also, great individual variations among patients make them imprecise and unreliable [3] . Objectives: We proposed an experimental bronchodilator dosing schedule based on each individual's airway resistance (R aw ) monitored periodically.

Objective: Review our experience in the management and evolution of patients with Severe ARDS during 3 years in a second level hospital. In our analysis we took into account the treatment approach, mode of ventilation, PEEPs, the resistance and compliance values reported by the ventilator and recorded automatically. Methods: A retrospective study of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation between 2013-2015 at Hospital Virgen de la Concha(Zamora, Spain) due to severe ARDS. 23 patients admitted during this period have a deterioration of PaO2/FiO2 to levels lower than or equal to 100 during a 24 hours period and requiring at least 5 days of ICU admission. Epidemiological data, presumed cause of ARDS, management (steroids, neuromuscular blocking agents, inhaled beta-agonists), mechanical ventilation parameters (maximum PEEP,resistance,compliance,driving pressure) were analysed. We divided arbitrarily between HOR (high concentration of oxygen required, greater than or equal to 60 %) and LOR period (low oxygen concentration required, less than 60 %). Results: The overall severe ARDS mortality was of 56.52 %. The pronation strategy was carried out in 39.13 % of the patients. The median ICU stay, mechanical ventilation and high oxygen requirement (HOR) duration was of 24.47; 16.6 and 8.43 days. The maximum PEEP used in this group of patients was 17 cmH20; with a median value of 13.2 cmH20. The pulmonary resistance, compliance and driving pressure (DP) in the non-surviving group were (19.21 cmH20/l/sec; 45.39 ml/cmH20; 14.20 cmH20), in the surviving group were (15.38 cmH20/l/sec; 47.82 ml/cmH20; 12.10 cmH20). The mortality in the group with DP higher than 15 during HOR was 100 %, being 33.3 % in the group with lower DP values (p < 0.05). Conclusions: We found that non-surviving patients have higher resistance and lower compliance values in their respiratory system and the improvement of its values were associated with better clinical outcome.The driving pressure was the variable that best stratified the surviving and non-surviving patients.

UK Guidelines for HIV testing 3 do not specifically address ICU patients. However, consideration of universal testing is recommended for medical inpatients when local prevalence exceeds 2 per 1000, as in Milton Keynes. Our previous practice of HIV testing was based on informal assessment of risk, with correspondingly low testing rates. Evidence shows that testing rates increase when opt-out policies are adopted in other settings 3 and we elected to implement this in our ICU. In patients with capacity, we sought consent prior to testing. In those lacking capacity, testing was performed in their best interests. There is limited UK data on the cost-effectiveness of expanded HIV testing but US data suggests it is cost-effective if 1 new diagnosis is made per 1,000 tests. 4 We report our experiences following a year of opt-out testing. Introduction: Over the last decade, survival rates in critically ill cancer patients have improved dramatically. [1] Earlier admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) has resulted in better survival rates for critically ill cancer patients. [2] Selecting patients likely to benefit from ICU admission is based on complex criteria, and some ICU specific therapies such as mechanical ventilation\u037e have been associated with an increase in mortality. [3] Objectives: To identify clinical characteristics of oncological patients admitted to our ICU and to identify risk factors associated with 14 day mortality in this specific population. Methods: Five -year retrospective observational analysis was performed including all patients with a personal history of active oncological malignancies admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care University Hospital in Spain. Patients\u00b4demographic, clinical features and outcome were recorded. Data were expressed as frequency (percentage) and median (interquartile range IQR). Multivariate logistic regression with significant covariables at 0,05 was performed to identify specific risk factors for 14 day mortality. Results: One hundred and thirty six patients were registered in this period. Age (median 60,IQR 2575: 5270), ICU Length of stay (LOS) (median 5 (IQR 2575:28) Principal reason to admission to ICU was respiratory failure (41,9 %), followed by septic shock (33,8 %) and low conscious level (8,1 %). Top three solid malignancies were lung (27.2 %), followed by breast (12.5 %) and Bowel (11.8 %) . No differences in co morbidities between Survivors and nonsurvivors at 14 day were assessed. APACHE II score was higher in non survivors median 25 (IQR 2575:18,731,5\u037e p = 0,002) versus survivors and this group had more frequently mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Multivariate logistic regression for 14 day mortality assessed mechanical ventilation OR:3.59 (CI95%:1.438.97, p = 0,006) and APACHE II increases in 1score OR 1.06 (CI95%:1.011.23, p = 0,021) as independent risk factors for 14 day mortality in ICU. Conclusions: Oncological critically ill patients remain as a high mortality population. Mechanical ventilation and increases in one point in APACHE II score at admission to ICU are independent risk factor for 14 day mortality. Introduction: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients (HSCTR) admitted to an ICU have a high mortality (52 %-83 % 1 ), limited data exists regarding six-month mortality rates. The aim of our study was to investigate the outcomes and explore nonrespiratory predictors of ICU and six-month mortality, and to compare our result with a previous publication 2 done in our center, in order to learn if outcome has improved. Methods: Retrospective study. We analyzed all HSCTR who were admitted to our ICU from January 2009 to March 2015. We recovered demographic data, reason for ICU admission and all the possible variables related with mortality. Statistical analysis was done using the Chi-square test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous non-parametric variables. Results: During the study period a total of 25 HSCTR required ICU care, and this accounted for 33 admissions (7 of them were readmitted). General patient characteristics are shown in Table 49 . The most frequent cause for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure (56 %) followed by non-respiratory sepsis (7 patients; 28 %) and by acute coronary syndrome, brain stroke, hemophagocytic syndrome and veno-occlusive disease (one case each; 4 %). Twenty patients had 2 or more organ failures: respiratory (64 %), hemodynamic (64 %) and renal (72 %; use of renal replacement techniques in 32 %). All patients received antibiotic treatment, and 9 of them (36 %) had positive microbiological results. Mean ICU stay was 9 days (2-35). In our study, ICU mortality was 48 % (12 of 25 patients), inhospital mortality 60 % (15/25) and six-month mortality was 72 % (18 of 25 patients).

Conclusions: Pre-ICU hospital days, 24 h SOFA, number of organ failures and isolated renal failure are factors associated with ICU mortality. The presence of lower counts in the first 24 h of platelets, leukocytes and neutrophils together with pre-ICU hospital days were related with six-month mortality. Although mortality rates in HSCTR admitted to ICU have decreased, ICU, in-hospital and six-month survival rates are still low.

Introduction: Sepsis and SS are one of the most serious complications in neutropenic pts.

During the study period, total SOFA score did not differ between the groups. However, since second day cardiovascular SOFA score and respiratory SOFA score were lower (p < 0.05) in MSCs-CT group, than in CT-group. 28-days survival rates were 20 % (3 out of 15 pts) in CT group and 60 % (9 out of 15 pts) in CT + MSCs group (P < 0.05). Despite higher 28-days survival rates in MSCs + CT group only 4 of 9 pts survived 28 days remained alive in 3 months, 5 pts died due to sepsis related organ dysfunctions. In 3 months there were no differences in survival between the groups. Conclusions: Administration of MSCs in first hours of SS improves organ dysfunction and short-term survival in neutropenic pts, but doesn\u00b4t prevent death from sepsis related organ dysfunctions in long term period. Perhaps, it is required repeated administration of MSCs. Introduction: Patients with acute respiratory failure on ventilators constitute the majorities of patients in intensive care units (ICU). Early extubation has always been one goal that medical teams want to achieve. Objectives: Rehabilitation invention has already been administered in ICUs in other countries and has successfully helped achieve the goal of early extubation. It is therefore hoped that physical therapy as intervention can help create a safe environment that facilitates early extubation for patients. Methods: The participating patients with acute respiratory failure were all in the conditions of stable hemodynamics, normal nutritional status and no infectious complications and first underwent joint assessment by the medical teams based on their progresses in recovery after treatment for their diseases before receiving rehabilitation consultation, which directed them to cardiopulmonary rehabilitation that included T-tube training. Upon the confirmation of their ventilator weaning indications, their endotracheal tubes were removed. They were then engaged in early ambulation activities ranging from Level II to Level IV according to their abilities. During this period, the medical teams conducted 3 sessions of education training led by physical therapists, followed by exercises and group testing. Results: Days of ventilator use were reduced from 6.3 (days) previously to 4.1 (days) after improvement. The secondary goal, i.e. days in ICUs, were reduced from 10 (days) to 6.1 (days). Hospitalization costs were also reduced from NT$329,000 before improvement to NT$241,000 during improvement and NT$186,000 after improvement. During the improvement, no tube slippage or patient falls occurred. This shows that this innovative proposal has achieved its purpose and also ensured patient safety. Conclusions: It is suggested that medical teams for ventilation in severe cases can develop weaning protocols that have shared goals and integrate multiple technologies and find weaning solutions for ventilator dependent patients by exploring literature and relevance of content in protocols. This provides possible indicators for assessing healthcare for ventilator dependent patients and serves as a reference for healthcare facilities in developing patient care plans. Results: 159 (21.4 %) of 740 patients who were monitored in GICU belonged to a Syrian nationality who were the victims of the Syrian civil war. A total of 795 patients were requested for hospitalization in GICU, while GICU stay of 55 (6.9 %) patients were rejected because of full bed occupancy. Mean age (34.3 \u00b1 12.4 years), gender distribution (women, n = 36; 22.6 %), and men, n = 123; 77.4 %), and the mean APACHE II score (24.2 \u00b1 13.7) of the patients were recorded as indicated. The most common indications for hospitalization were multisitel shrapnel injuries (42.7 %), subarachnoidal bleeding (SAK) (42.1 %) caused by firearm injuries, and chest gunshot wounds (5.6 %). Total number of days of GICU hospitalization were 4300 days, while patients with Syrian nationality stayed in the GICU a total of 1558 (36.2 %) days. Mean duration of hospitalization was 9.7 days. Average mortality rate among all GICU patients in 2013 (26 %) was lower than that of Syrian citizens (n = 49 deaths, mortality rate 30.8 %; n = 12 women; 24.4 %). The standardized mortality ratio [observed mortality (49/159), according to the APACHE II score of expected mortality rate (48 /159) ratio] was 1.02 Conclusions: Because of higher APACHE II score, increased incidence of gunshot hwounds, and transportation of the patients from a distance of over 100 kilometer under unfavourable conditions increased mortality rates were observed. Introduction: The massively increasing knowledge of recent years about the importance of circadian rhythms is orientating the researchers from laboratories towards the bedside (1). Objectives: The daily pattern of MT production is the main regulator of circadian rhythms, with the strongest known signal of its release being the daily change of light and darkness. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the MT production in septic and non-septic groups of ICU patients suffering from severe night light pollution. Methods: Mechanically ventilated patients over 18 years, without CNS damage were enrolled in the study. Illuminance levels (IL) were measured by a lux meter. Serum MT levels were determined from arterial blood samples. Sampling and IL measurements were performed after admission at 01:00, 07:00, 13:00 and 19:00 constitutively for 96 hours. Blood samples were kept in total darkness before being centrifuged, then serum samples were placed into \u221280\u00b0C until MT measurement was performed. Repeated correlation analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between illuminance and MT levels. The equality of MT variances was tested by fitting two nested models and comparing their likelihoods. Results: Out of the 28 enrolled patients 15 were able to take over the study. 8 patients proved to be septic and 7 non-septic, which was sufficient to form subgroups. Out of the 16 measurements/patient, 240 MT samples were analysed. Although IL were the lowest at 01:00 [19(3-101) lux], estimated MT peaks were missing, the median (IQR) was 30(24-51) pg/ml at this time point. Although repeated correlation analysis between MT and IL showed a non-significant between-subject correlation (r = 0.438, P = 0.103), the MT variances of septic subgroup were 70 % of the non-septic variances. In spite of the low sample size the fixed effect of subgroup was statistically highly significant (P < 0.0001), in general higher MT levels were observed in the septic subgroup. Conclusions: Our results indicate that circadian rhythm is desynchronized in ICU patients, as indicated by the missing MT peaks during the night, the absence of the normal 24 h rhythm of MT release and by the poor correlation between illumination and MT levels. This first observation suggests that absence of darkness at night and the missing contrast of day and night light levels can rapidly destruct the rhythm of MT release. The cause(s) of our second observation, namely that patients in septic subgroup showed lower MT variances and higher MT levels in general needs to be elucidated by studies focusing on this phenomenon, conducted in larger patient population. Based on these observations, future trials on light/dark conditions and patient outcomes could lead to redesigned healthcare environments, which may help restore circadian rhythmicity and reach health benefits. Objectives: Aim of this study was to assess burnout in ICU physicians and nurses in a national level and to identify possible contributing factors. Methods: A cross-sectional, multicenter study in 18 Greek ICUs was conducted between June and December 2015. Scores of Exhaustion, Depersonalization and Personal Accomplishment from the Maslash Burnout Inventory Questionnaire 2 were recorded in the 469 study participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify predicting factors for burnout. Results: A high participation rate was recorded (65.7 %). Baseline participant characteristics, scores of burnout, as well as statistical comparisons between the medical and nursing staff are shown in (Table 51 and 52) . ICU nurses compared to doctor participants were mainly females (80.8 % vs. 55.6 %, chi-square test, p < 0.001), almost a decade younger (p < 0.001), had less working experience (p < 0.001), and declared lower job satisfaction (p = 0.001). Exhaustion scores were relatively low but statistically different between doctors and nurses (22.8 % and 37.5 % respectively, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001), while differences in scores of depersonalization and personal accomplishment did not reach statistical significant levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 53) identified two independent predicting factors for high exhaustion: to be a nurse (Odds ratio 1.6, 95 % CI 1.1-2.7, p = 0.05) and to have low job satisfaction (Odds Ratio 0.2, 95 % CI 0.1-0.4, p < 0.001). Other factors like gender, age, working experience, working in university hospitals or having personal experience of losing a close family member were found not to be associated with burnout. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate low burnout levels in Greek ICU personnel. Nurses are more exhausted compared to doctors. The major contributing factor for burnout is job satisfaction. Introduction: Despite their importance in informing care interventions, significant barriers exist in Critical Care in regards to the measurement of height and weight. Common interventions based on weight include lung-protective ventilation in ARDS management [1] , renal replacement therapy, and antibiotic dosing. Studies have investigated the use of a calibrated ulnar length (UL) tape in tidal volume (VT) measurements [2] , whilst our institution uses a formula converting actual height (AH) to ideal body weight. We have demonstrated in previous audits poor compliance with measurement of actual height and wished to investigate the performance of UL to improve compliance. Objectives: We performed a three-way comparison comprising height derived from UL versus AH, and clinician estimation (CE) versus AH. We sought to simulate the clinical effects of applying measured and derived values into the common clinical parameter of 6 ml/kg VT lung-protective ventilation. Methods: We sampled 16 Critical Care patients and 4 healthy volunteers. Participants were measured supine, semi-recumbent or sitting. UL was measured between olecranon process and ulnar styloid. AH was measured in the position the participant was approached in, using a summation of heel to knee, knee to greater trochanter (GT), and GT to vertex lengths. CE was estimated by a Consultant Intensivist, blinded to actual measurements. Results were analysed using Excel, with correlation of results performed using Bland-Altman plots and regression analysis. Results: A significant correlation between performance of UL and AH was obtained (P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between CE and either UL or AH. Similarly, when converted to 6 ml/kg VT, a statistically significant correlation was obtained between UL and AH and (P < 0.01) but not CE. Estimates of height ranged between -16 cm and +5 cm, most commonly underestimating height. VT extrapolated from CE gave a range between \u221241.4 ml and +68.4 ml. Conclusions: Significant barriers to measuring height in Critical Care exist, including lack of pre-morbid measurement, immobility, and lack of suitable equipment. Anecdotally there may have been a tendency for clinicians to rely on estimation of height and weight which can erroneously form the basis for regimes in a range of interventions. Our study confirms UL validity as a proxy of formal height measurement, and the poor performance of estimation compared to AH and UL. We propose UL measurement as an acceptable standard of care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 309, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10074, "end": 10077, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 10237, "end": 10240, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 8634, "end": 8651, "text": "(Table 51 and 52)", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 9217, "end": 9227, "text": "(Table 53)", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Funding"}, {"text": "Development of an automated data extraction process for use in retrospective pharmacokinetic analyses: initial application to vancomycin dose and concentration data in patients using citrate and heparin CVVHDF anticoagulation modalities Introduction: Critically ill patients have altered antibiotic pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics, which are further affected by continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) (1).

Introduction: Daily blood tests are a long running feature of ICU care, and are regarded as an essential diagnostic tool by medical staff, however they aren't without their drawbacks. The risk of iatrogenic anaemia is a very real one and there are significant costs involved in both equipment and staff time.1 With this in mind guidelines were drawn up to limit excessive blood tests in otherwise stable patients. Objectives: We audited adherence to these guidelines in 2015 finding 292 unnecessary vials of blood taken in a 20 bed unit. Guidelines were clarified and advertised on posters and then we re-audited. Methods: In order to establish trends and to exclude stable post surgical patients we limited eligible patients to those who were on the unit for 3 days or more. A simple proforma was designed to record which common blood tests had been performed, daily haematocrit and haemoglobin (if tested), and any major change in overall condition or events such as transfusions or surgery. On six randomly assigned days over a 2 month period, all eligible patients on the unit had a proforma filled retrospectively for all days up until their admission to the unit, or up to seven days previously, whichever sooner.

We aim to re-audit our practice within the next 6 months to ascertain the impact of these changes. Introduction: Hospital Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) programs have achieved savings and more rational use of antimicrobial treatments. However, intervention over antimicrobial treatment of critical patients with hematologic disease is highly complicated Objectives: To evaluate a two years experience of an AMS program intervention in patients with hematologic disease admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We designed a quasi-experimental study. AMS strategies were put into practice during three years (January 2014-January 2016) in collaboration with the ICU nosocomial infection control team. Antimicrobial treatment was revised twice a week. If any antimicrobial treatment modification was recommended in the AMS meeting, a face-to-face interview was held between AMS team and the attending physician. ICU length of stay and ICU mortality rate were compared with the same time period previous to AMS implementation. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using T-student and Fischer exact test (Stata v.13.0). (1) . However, the opinions of health care professionals on this subject remain unknown. Moreover, communication with ICU patients is becoming increasingly important since ICU guidelines aim to reduce the use of sedatives, thus it is expected that more patients will be awake and able to communicate (2) . Objectives: To investigate communication issues with MV patients as experienced by ICU health care professionals. The primary aim was to quantify the extent of the problem and to determine its effect on patient care and job satisfaction. The secondary aim was to identify patient and health care factors associated with communication difficulties and to evaluate the preference and effectiveness of currently available communication methods. Introduction: ICU is a high demand area in the hospital, with a large demand supply gap especially in limited resource countries. In addition, it requires a higher staffing ratio than rest of the hospital. Objectives: To explore the impact of multiple factors for increasing bed turnover during expanding newly developed ICU. Methods: Observation study during gradual opening of 18 beds medical/surgical ICU from June 2014 till March 2016. It is a part of Alexandria University (primary and tertiary) hospitals covering 2 governorates receiving a lot of emergency patients. In September 2015, outreach critical care services were provided for early discharge of ICU patients but was inactive since April 2015 due to financial problem. In September 2015 post-operative ICU was opened but the nursing staff was recruited from general ICU. In January 2016, proactive ICU project was implemented which included reducing the time of delay of investigation for ICU patients, daily care plan for rapid stabilization, implementing end of life care decisions, and avoiding inappropriate antibiotic or medication use. In Feburary 2016, administration increased ICU capacity with same number of nursing staff. Results: 347 patients were admitted to Smouha University ICU, from which 147 patients died (42.4 %). The mean mortality rate was 43.9 % (28-84.6 %), with mean APACHE II score of 23 (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) , and mean expected mortality 46.5 % (23.5-70.3). The relative mortality (actual/expected) ranged from 0.35 to 1.25 with mean 0.88 %. Mean Bed occupancy ranged from 4 till 13 beds. After failure of outreach service, bed turnover was similar (2.29 to 2.3). Before and after opening of post-operative ICU, The mortality rate of post-operative cases was higher in post-operative ICU than in general ICU (9.5 vs 2 %, p = 0.019), with lower occupancy rate (4.5 vs 10 patients per month, p = 0.277), and higher mean ICU stay (3.5 vs 1.2 days, p = 0.02). Before and after implementation of proactive ICU, the number of admissions significantly increased from 18 to 33 (p = 0.003), insignificantly higher occupancy rate from 1.8 to 2.8 (p = 0.345), and significantly decreased waiting time for ICU admission from 38 to 6 hours (p < 0.001). However ICU complication increased; unexpected cardiac arrest from 7.5 to 18.5/1000 patient days (p = 0.002), unplanned extubation from 21 to 35/1000 ventilator days (p = 0.305), deep vein thrombosis from 0 to 4.7 % (p = 0.259) and pneumothorax from 3 to 2 % together with increased mortality and relative mortality insignificantly (45.7 to 59 % and 0.89 to 1.13 respectively) Conclusions: From multiple efforts to increase ICU turnover, end of life care decisions and proactive ICU seems most effective, however the expense of increasing nursing and doctor load must be weighted to avoid iatrogenic complications. Also diverting post-operative patients to specialized ICU needed more nurses without better patients outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1672, "end": 1675, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1972, "end": 1975, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3800, "end": 3804, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF227"}, {"start": 3805, "end": 3809, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3810, "end": 3814, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3815, "end": 3819, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3820, "end": 3824, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3825, "end": 3829, "text": "(21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF418"}, {"start": 3830, "end": 3834, "text": "(22)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3835, "end": 3839, "text": "(23)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3840, "end": 3844, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3845, "end": 3849, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3850, "end": 3854, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3855, "end": 3859, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3860, "end": 3864, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3869, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3870, "end": 3874, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A634"}, {"text": "Better \"guesstimates\" -defining, standardising and documenting safe, accurate and consistent values for actual and ideal body weight in a uk university teaching hospital critical care service Introduction: Knowledge of the critically ill patient's Actual Body Weight (ABW) and Ideal Body Weight (IBW) guide safe treatment in Critical Care (1, 2) .

Tracheostomy displacement is one of the most serious and frequent of all airway events in critical care and is associated with 50 % of airway related deaths in this setting 1,2 . As such a timely emergency action plan is a necessity for critical care areas 1,2,3 . Objectives: We aimed to carry out a service improvement project to improve timely escalation of patients with dislodged tracheostomies to senior airway trained doctors.

Introduction: The length of oral ETT in males and females has been recommended as 23 cm and 21 cm respectively from corner of mouth to above carina, standards described for Western population. Caucasian population tends to be taller than Asian population. We, thus retrospectively analysed whether it is true in Asian population of smaller stature and whether there is any correlation between height of the patient to the ideal length of oral ETT. Objectives: To validate the ideal length of oral ETT in Asian Population compared to Western standards. This plays an important role while securing ETTs especially in Intensive care patients, as they tend to be intubated for an average of 3-5 days and require lot of movements during day to day care. Either securing the tube too low or too high can cause either right sided endo-bronchial intubation or high risk of accidental extubation respectively. These inadvertent impediments predispose already critically ill patients to significant risks and complications. We suggest that females and males in Asian population especially in South East Asia should have their endo-tracheal tubes secured at corner of mouth by at least one cm less in comparison to western population. Evans administered with a spoon in middle third of the tongue), then we observed wheather aspiration signs appear (early/late cough, symptoms of asphyxia, or more than 3 percentage points basal pulse oximetry desaturations), and the posible blue stained secretions suctioned through the tracheostomy tube.

The validity and performance enhancement were calculated, and the ROC curve was made with 95 % CI. The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Results: 26 patients underwent FEES + EEBD: 7 had FEES without aspiration and a negative EEBD. 19 had FEES with aspiration, 16 were positive and 3 negative EEBD.

Conclusions 1-The EEBD is a significant and simple diagnostic screening tool in dysphagia secondarily to artificial airway. 2-In our opinion if the EEBD is negative and there is high clinic suspicion, FEES should be considered to confirm, or not, dysphagia. Introduction: Supraglottic airway devices are used with increasing frequency following routine anesthesia and for emergency airway management. Unfortunately, not all devices allow a possibility to perform a secondary endotracheal intubation (ETI) through the device. A new promising device, the Spritztube (ST), has been developed combining the ability to perform both supraglottic ventilation and orotracheal fibreoptic intubation using the same device. Particularly, it is able to perform a supraglottic ventilation during positioning as tracheal cannula during fibroscopy. Objectives: To compare the ease, the time of insertion, and the success rates of use between the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach\u2122) and the novel tracheal tube (Spritztube \u00ae). Methods: We evaluated the novel Spritztube and compared it to the Fastrach using a manikin-based study. Each partecipant received a verbal instruction and practical demonstration of technique of insertion for both devices on patient simulation manikins. Each participants used both devices in a randomised order. Time of placement (T1), time of inflation (T2), the elapsed procedural time (T3), ease of insertion, time of exchange maneouver for intubation (T4), success rates and number of attempts were recorded for each supraglottic device.

Therefore is essential to follow a clinical guideline in the removal of the AA once overcome weaning and espontaneous breathing test. Objetive: To describe the incidence of treatable causes for negative cuff-leak test in our critical care unit. Methods: We prospectively registered all patients admitted in our ICU (18 beds) who underwent artificial airway procedure (endotracheal tube or tracheotomy) during 24 months (from January 2014 to December 2015). In every patient who overcome the weaning guideline process (including spontaneous breathing test), we implemented also an aritificial airway removal guideline, containing the cuff-leak test, in Volume Controlled Ventilation (CMV) and with the cuff deflated. If leak rate was greater than 20 % of tidal volumen, \"positive test\", we could safely remove the artificial airway. If leak rate was less than 20 %, \"negative test\", an upper airway revision by direct laryngoscopy was performed to evaluate treatable causes. Results: We registered 407 patients in ICU with artificial airway procedures (endotracheal tuve, tracheotomy) during the study period. Mean age was 62 years (48-76 CI 95 %), 67,8 % were male and the mean APACHE was 23 (33-13 CI 95 %). Before extubation/decanulation, cuff-leak test was performed. 374 (91.9 %) had \"positive test\" and 33 (8.1 %) \"negative test\". In these negative test a direct laryngoscopy was performed and the following treatable causes were found: 23 laryngeal edema, 2 dental bridge impacted in the pharynx, 1 supraostial laryngeal edema plus granuloma, 1 edema plus decubitus, 1 laryngeal granuloma, 1 distal tube obstruction, 1 laryngeal granuloma in intercricotiroidea tracheotomy, 1 with a bloodclot in the larynx and finally 1 with a tumor in vocal cordv (Fig. 82) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2375, "end": 2384, "text": "(Fig. 82)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "A663"}, {"text": "The inclusion of an upper airway direct laryngoscopy exam after negative cuff-leak test, ensures specific diagnosis and manage of the treatable causes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "In all our patients, the artificial airway was safely removed after treating the cause, avoiding the increase of morbimortality due to reintubation/recanulation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "How do we deal with the airway: assessment in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) C. Sepsis is frequently complicated by organ dysfunction and the lungs seem to be particularly vulnerable to the inflammatory response. The disabling fatigue and the higher susceptibility to developing a viral respiratory infection that many survivors experience in post-sepsis syndrome cannot yet be explained. Herein, we sought to evaluate the impact of sepsis on lung structures of the post-sepsis survivors. Methods: Adult Wistar rats (200 g) were submitted to sepsis [iv. 2 mL E. coli 10 8 (S8) or 10 9 CFU/ mL (S9), DL60 and DL80, respectively, in 26 hours].Under general anesthesia, the lung architecture was monitored by histology at 6 hours after sepsis (T6h, n = 3/group) and 30 th day survivals (T30d, n = 3/group). The lungtissue wasexaminedafter staining with H.E. Results: The S8-6 h group showed a vascular congestion of the alveolar wall, alveolar wall thickening and neutrophils infiltration.It was also observed an increase in cellularity in the bronchial lumen and BALT hyperplasia (Fig. 86) . After 30 days was observed a reduction of the alveolar wall thickening, complete reduction of alveoli vascular congestion in the entire lung, however, there was a persistence of the hyperplasia of BALT. In animals submitted to more severe sepsis (S9-30d), the alveolar wall thickening remained more intense, there was decreased of inflammatory cells infiltrates, but persisted the alveoli wall congestion and BALT hyperplasia and hypertrophy (Fig. 2) . These findings showed that depending on the severity of sepsis, the parenchyma and pulmonary microcirculation injuries may have significant recovery (S8) or minimal (S9), even 30 days after the clinical recovery from sepsis. In addition, presence of histological signs suggestive of persistence of a state of the activated BALT, even in less aggressive sepsis (S8-30d), shows that still exist a continuous stimulating inflammatory factor even in the absence of clinical signs of infection. Thus, the overall data demonstrate that clinical recovery is not synonymous of a normal physiological state, on the contrary, histology showed an ongoing severe lung disease process at post-sepsis period. How long last these eventsis unknown, but the data suggest that post-sepsis physiological state is far from the standard health. Introduction: Eph-Ephrin signaling mediates various cellular processes, including vascular permeability, inflammation, angiogenesis, cell migration, axon guidance, fluid homeostasis, and repair after injury. The detailed mechanisms of EphA2 signaling in lung injury are unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the role of EphA2 signaling, as well as related signaling pathways, in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury model. Methods: Three experimental mouse groups were formed: PBS + IgG (IgG instillation after PBS exposure), LPS + IgG (IgG instillation after LPS exposure), and LPS+ EphA2 mAb (EphA2 monoclonal antibody instillation posttreatment after LPS exposure). Cell numbers and protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), changes in histopathology and the expression of several signaling pathway proteins-including PI3K-Akt-NF-kB, Src, Erk, E-cadherin and mTOR-were compared among the three groups. Results: Acute LPS exposure significantly upregulated EphA2 and EphrinA1 expression. Inhibition of the EphA2 receptor by intranasal EphA2 mAb administration attenuated lung injury and reduced BALF cell counts and protein concentration (all, P < 0.05). EphA2 mAb posttreatment downregulated the expression of PI3K 110\u03b3, phospho-Akt, phospho-NF-kB, Erk1/Erk2, phospho-Src, and phospho-S6K. In addition, inhibiting the EphA2 receptor augmented the expression of E-cadherin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion. Conclusions: The present data suggest that the EphA2 receptor may be an unrecognized modulator of several signaling pathways-including PI3K-Akt-NF-kB, Src-NF-kB, E-cadherin, and mTOR-in LPS-induced lung injury.

The present study investigated the effects of aggressive-fluid therapy in lung tissues of the sepsis survivors. Methods: Adult Wistar rats (200 g) were submitted to sepsis (S8) (iv. 2 mL E. coli 10 8 CFU/mL \u22121 , DL60 in 26 hours), or sepsis and Ringer Lactate (S8HH) (iv. 30 mL/kg/20 min), 30 minutes after sepsis challenge. The tissue samples were evaluated by histology (T6h,T30d), using HE dyes.The S8-6 h group showed a vascular congestion on the alveoli walls, withintense thickening and infiltration of neutrophils, and increased cellular invasioninto the bronchus lumen. BALT showed intense hyperplasia. InS8-30d animals,there was a reduction in thickening of the alveoli wall, the absence of thecapillary congestion throughout the lung, but with cellular debris in the bronchial lumenand a persistent BALT hyperplasia (Fig. 88) . The aggressive fluid therapy in S8HH-6 h group resulted in lesser vascular congestion in the peripheral alveolar walls. More pronounced lesions were seenin the central part of the organ (hilo); with venous congestion and thickening of the alveoli-wall, infiltration of mononuclearcells and neutrophils in intra epithelia's spaces of the bronchi; BALT hyperplasia was highly evident. The aggressive fluid didnot recovered the injuries of the S8HH-30d group. the vascular congestion and thickened parenchyma were observed in whole lung, although without inflammatory infiltrate. BALT showed less hypertrophy and hyperplasia. In summary, although there was a worsening of the alveoli injuries, the signs of non-activated BALT suggested low immune activation under aggressive-fluid therapy but with high pulmonary edema due to their high permeability characteristics. The overall data suggested that lung not have adequate physiology and anatomy to support a fluid aggressive therapy demanding a more careful maneuver in terms of volume and perfusion velocity. These results reinforce the doubts that inadequate management of sepsis may cause consequences in the future. Introduction: During weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), pulmonary oedema may develop due to cardiac failure, and it is a cause of failure in weaning from IMV. Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema produces hemoconcentration and haematocrit (Ht) is a good marker of hemoconcentration. It is not determined if the increase of Ht during weaning protocol may predict failure in weaning from IMV. Objective: To determine if the increase of Ht during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is a predictor of failure in weaning from IMV. Methods: We prospectively included patients with IMV >72 hours. A SBT was performed with a T-piece for two hours. Ht value at the start and at the end (or failure) of the SBT was measured and the delta was calculated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between the increase of Ht and failure in weaning from IMV. Its performance as a predictor of failure was assessed by its discriminative capacity and calibration. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Fifty-five patients were analysed, 58.2 % female, mean age 49.9 years. Thirty-two (58. Conclusions: Patients who failed in weaning from IMV has significantly increased the value of Ht at the end of the SBT.

Results: Of the 473 patients admitted to the ICU, 24 developed VAP. The incidence rate was 5.07 %, and the incidence density rate was 9.74 per 1000 ventilation days.

The adherence to VAP prevention bundles from January to October 2015 was 14,91 %. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the incidence of VAP was reduced from 2014 to 2015. The increase on adherence to VAP bundles might explain this signigficant reduction. Decrease on VAP incidence was significantly asociated with reduction on days of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. Introduction: Driving airway pressure, the difference between plateau (end of an inspiratory pause) and end-expiratory airway pressure, can be an independent predictor of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1] . However, during ongoing mechanical ventilation, (dynamic) end-inspiratory airway pressure exceeds (static) plateau airway pressure, especially when inspiratory flows are very high [2] .

Methods that can provide simultaneously high-resolution, in-vivo conditions and information about the core region of the lungs are lacking.

AD during HC showed a tendency to reduce progressively after 9 cmH 2 O; during ARDS this tendency was observed sharply after 6 cmH 2 O. Conclusions: Alveolar kinetics is different between healthy and ARDS conditions. In HC and ARDS de-recruitment and isotropic deflation are both present, however their entity and proportion depend on the applied pressure. In HC, alveolar dimensions in the studied range support the idea of a continuous derecruitment simultaneous with isotropic deflation. In ARDS, passage from PEEP 12 to 6 cmH 2 O is characterized by a sharp derecruitment (alveoli do not change appreciably dimensions but can be either open or closed). In ARDS lungs this may be consequence of their high critical closing pressures and elastance. Introduction: We have previously found that during spontaneous breathing (SB) the diaphragm exerts an expiratory breaking effect, maintaining lung volume. In this experimental study in a porcine mild acute respiratory distress (ARDS) model we compared the effect on lung aeration between full mechanical ventilation (MV) and SB and our hypothesis was that SB, due to the breaking activity by the diaphragm, would improve intraparenchymal distribution of gas during expiration and reduce atelectasis formation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A666"}, {"text": "Methods: A mild acute respiratory distress syndrome was induced in five anesthetized, tracheostomized pigs by repeated lung lavages, targeting a PaO 2 /FiO 2 of 250 mmHg. After stabilization, the animals were allowed to breathe spontaneously and underwent a decremental continuous positive end-expiratory pressure (CPAP/PEEP) trial at 15, 12, 9, 6, 3 and 0 cmH 2 O. Then the same sequence was repeated during MV after muscle relaxation. Para-diaphragmatic expiratory dynamic CT-scans were collected four (L1) and one (L2) cm cranial to the diaphragm. The amount of gas (Vgas, [mL]) for each CT-image at half and end expiration was calculated in all the compartments from +100 to \u22121000 Hounsfield Units (HU). The amount of atelectasis (between \u2212100 and +100 HU) for each selected CT-image was also measured. Paired samples Student t-test was applied to assess any statistically significant difference between study conditions. Results: At CPAP/PEEP levels equal or lower than 6 cmH 2 O, Vgas was higher during SB than during MV at all distances from the diaphragmatic dome and, in addition, at both half and end-expiration. The increase in atelectasis with decreasing CPAP/PEEP was in all animals larger during MV than SB. Only during SB, and not during MV conditions, the lung near the diaphragmatic dome (L2) was less atelectatic than the lung further away from it (L1). More atelectasis during MV than SB was observed already at half-expiration. Conclusions: SB maintains the amount of lung aeration significantly better than MV in a collapse-prone mild ARDS model. Furthermore, SB protected against atelectasis formation: this effect was visible already at half expiration. Therefore we deduce that the improved redistribution of gas and the decreased atelectasis formation depend on the preserved diaphragmatic contraction.

Introduction: Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death in adults in many parts of the world. Every year estimated 350.000 to 700.000 people in Europe are suffering CA and receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) can be found in up to 10 % of critically ill patients. To date, data on incidence and outcome of HH after out-of-hospital CA and CPR is scarce. Objectives: Aim of the study was to determine incidence and outcome of HH in patients after out-of-hospital CA. Methods: Assessment of incidence of HH in a cohort of 798 consecutive patients with out-of-hospital CA and successful CPR that were treated at the Medical University Vienna, 168 (21 %) patients with HH could be identified. Patient characteristics, admission diagnosis, severity of disease, course of the disease and 28d mortality were assessed. Results: Overall, 168 patients representing 21 % of the total cohort (128 male, age 56 (47-66) years) developed HH after CA with successful CPR were assessed. CA was witnessed in 136 (81 %) cases. Initial rhythm was shockable (VT/VF) in 90 (54 %), non-shockable (PEA/ Asystole) in 75 (44 %) and unknown in 3 (2 %) patients. Time to ROSC was 27 (13,25 -46,50) minutes. Cardiac events leading to CA were observed in 108 (64 %) of patients. SOFA-Score on admission was 11 (9-12), SAPS II was 80 (75-86).149 (89 %) patients needed mechanical ventilation on admission and 123 (73 %) needed vasopressor support. Mild therapeutic hypothermia was applied in 125 (74 %) patients. 28d-survival was 45 % in patients with HH and 60 % in the total cohort (p < 0,05). 107 (64 %) patients with HH were dead or had bad neurological outcome (CPC III/IV) after 28d. Conclusions: New onset of HH is a frequent finding in patients following successful CPR out-of-hospital and is associated with worse outcome. Introduction: Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in many countries. Following cell necrosis, the release of intracellular damage-associated molecular patterns, like high-mobility group-box protein-1 or DNA fragments, induces a sterile inflammation mediated through interleukin-(IL) 1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), amongst others 1 . Procalcitonin (PCT) that is frequently used to monitor the course of systemic infections and inflammation is also up-regulated through these pro-inflammatory mediators 2 . Therefore, PCT could be a potential biomarker to monitor the course of APAP overdose patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A683"}, {"text": "Objectives: This pilot study sought to assess whether APAP administration induced PCT synthesis in an in vitro model of human hepatoma cells (HepaRG\u00a9) and to explore possible dose-dependent relationships.

Quantitative variables expressed as median [ , and SOFA 9 [7.5-11.5]. All patients had elevated levels of leukocytes, CRP, serum lactate and pyruvate. Pyruvate levels were higher in patients than in controls. HIF-1\u03b1 was higher in patients, reaching peak levels on day 3rd (2.06 times the inclusion day). In patients: a) levels of HLA-DR on monocytes circulating inclusion day were 2.86 times lower than in controls; b) IL-6 and IL-10 levels in patients were higher than in controls on the day of inclusion, with marked reduction at day 3rd (26.25 and 6.98 times respectively), IL6 was 1088.49 pg/ml and 0.17 pg/ml, respectively. IL10 values were 121.66 pg/ml in patients being undetectable in controls; c) there were no differences in HIF-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10 and tissue hypoxia between dead and survivors.

Introduction: The high inter-and intra-patient variability and confounding factors during early sepsis has made it difficult to diagnose and characterize. Despite this variability, serum cytokine levels such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) during sepsis appear to follow consistent and distinctive trajectories across patients. Objectives: To classify septic patients into groups defining endotypes of sepsis using longitudinal IL-6 trajectories and to estimate time of sepsis onset. Methods: The multicenter, randomized Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial enrolled 1341 patients with septic shock and showed a 16.3 % 14-day mortality. Patients with IL-6 measured at 0, 6, 24, and 72 hours after enrollment were selected for this analysis. Those with IL-6 values below the lower limit of detection or with missing measurements were excluded, leaving 164 patients for analysis. Each IL-6 trajectory was modeled as a differential equation evolving in response to inflammation. 3 classes of differential equations were used to enforce classification into specific dynamic behaviors: overdamped response, under-damped response, and overshoot-type response. Patient classification was performed based on best data fit to one of the 3 possible responses. Within each class of response, a Gaussian Mixture model on differential equation parameters was used to further classify each patient. The centers of each cluster generated a characteristic IL-6 response to sepsis (a master curve) for that sub-population. Aligning each patient along with their category master curve provided an estimate for disease time-zero with respect to onset of sepsis. Results: Subgroup analysis revealed a total of 5 distinct IL-6 responses: 1-high response and fast decline; 2-slow and protracted response; 3-fast response and protracted decline; 4-small response and fast decline; 5-sustained response. Statistical testing of clinical biomarkers between clusters revealed significant differences across 12 hour bins following disease onset. There were notable differences in vital signs, bilirubin, lactate, and urine output, establishing a correspondence between trajectory endotypes and physiological variables. This suggests that endotypes can be informed from easy and minimally-invasive measurements. Finally, endotypes were associated with distinct low and high mortality outcome. Endotype 5 exhibited particularly high mortality. Conclusions: A novel data-driven approach is proposed to generate sepsis endotypes and disease time-zero. The clusters provided physiological characterization of phenotypes. The knowledge of disease time as well as endotype risk can be used to guide treatments in order to shift sepsis patients towards better outcomes. Introduction: Acute cardiac events are common after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and are associated with an increased risk of poor outcome (1-3).

Twenty consecutive adult patients with severe TBI were matched according to age and gender with twenty control patients. Control group included adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for peripheral trauma surgery.

Results: We found similar LVEF between the TBI group and the PER-operative control group (61 % [56-76]) vs. 62 % [52-70]). LV morphological parameters and systolic function were also similar between the two groups. Regarding diastolic function, isovolumic relaxation time was significantly higher in the TBI cohort (125 s [84-178] versus 107 s [83-141], p = 0.04), suggesting subclinical diastolic dysfunction.

STE-derived parameters of diastolic function tended to be lower in TBI patients. Conclusions: No systematic myocardial depression was found in a cohort of severe TBI patients. STE rather revealed correct adaptation of left systolic function, while diastolic function slightly impaired. Introduction: The immediate events associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) result in early brain injury (EBI). Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) may also develop between 1-2 weeks after bleeding caused by vasospasm and other mechanisms. Characterizing both type of brain injury and standardising the diagnostic modalities is key to predicting and potentially modifying the outcome of SAH. Objectives: Use serial MR imaging to determine the characteristics of early and late brain injury and investigate their role in determining outcome after SAH. Methods: Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected. 6months outcome was evaluated using the extended GOS (GOS-E). Serial MRI scans were performed on days 0-5 (early), and 7-14 (late) following the acute bleeding. The MRI protocol included 3D-T1, T2, T2*-weighted sequences, 3D-FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC) were calculated. FLAIR, DWI/ ADC and T2 sequences were co-registered and volumes measured using the SPM and Analyze software. Early cerebral ischemia (ECI) and DCI were identified as hyper/hypointense lesions on the correspondent DWI/ADC maps. DWI were classified on the basis of the whole lesion volume: none (N), spotty (SP), \u226410 ml (S = small), and > 10 ml (L = large). Early cerebral haematomas (ECH) were identified on FLAIR and T2 and similarly classified as none (N), small (S) and large (L). All early lesions (excluding SP lesions) were named as EBI (ECI + ECH). Chi square test and logistic regression were used for univariable and multivariable analysis. Introduction: Acute stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability in western world 1 . An early risk assessment with estimate of the severity of disease and prognosis is pivotal for optimized care and allocation of healthcare resources. Novel biomarkers have emerged to assist clinicians with decision making. Copeptin is a novel neuroendocrine peptide that is a strong and independent prognostic marker for functional outcome and death in patients with acute stroke 3 Background and purpose: Stroke is an important cause of death worldwide, and the majority of stroke survivors suffer from some form of residual disability. This study aimed to investigate the association of blood biomarkers with stroke scales and their predictive value after acute stroke at the time of admission until hospital discharge. Design and methods: We investigated 60 patients with acute stroke who were admitted within 24 h of event onset at the intensive care unit or neurovascular emergency unit of Cl\u00ednicas Hospital. All patients provided venous blood samples for the measurement of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S100\u00df protein (S100\u00df), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) within 24 h of the acute event, on the third day and on the fifth day after the stroke. Neurological stroke severity and global disability were determined with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the same three times of blood collection and at the time of hospital discharge. Results: The serum levels of the S100\u00df protein, IL-6 and CRP seem to constitute the best panel of biomarkers after acute stroke in this study. When patients were subdivided into two groups according to the NIHSS (NIHSS \u2264 6 and NIHSS > 6) and mRS (mRS \u2264 3 and mRS > 3) scores, which were used as neurological outcome measures, both neurologic scores for good outcome (NIHSS \u2264 6 and mRS \u2264 3) at hospital discharge were significantly related to the S100\u00df protein and IL-6 levels at all of the measured time points. Among the analyzed blood markers, S100\u00df, IL-6 and PCR levels significanttly correlated with the stroke scales and prognostic value.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 218, "end": 221, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 257, "end": 260, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3457, "end": 3460, "text": "(S)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4122, "end": 4123, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A703"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Blood biomarkers may be useful in acute stroke either by suggesting stroke severity or providing a prognostic value. The addition of the S100\u00df protein, IL-6 and CRP to previously validated stroke scales slightly improves the ability of these scales to predict outcome. Introduction: In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), monitoring of brain metabolism using micro dialysis revealed that a decrease in brain glucose concentrations and an increase in lactate levels were markers of cellular alterations. However, such catheters are not used routinely. Few data are available on glucose and lactate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients. Objectives: Determine the relationship between glucose and lactate concentrations in CSF and arterial blood and the CSF glucose/lactate ratio and its correlation with outcome in severe TBI. Methods: We reviewed data from all patients admitted to a 35bed medico-surgical ICU following TBI over a 4-year period Introduction: To prevent delayed cerebal ischaemia (DCI), patients with spontaneous SAH (s-SAH) are frequently given supra-normal blood pressure targets. 1 If patients with DCI do not improve with hypertensive therapy (achieved using fluids and vasopressor drugs, e.g. noradrenaline), a trial of inotropic therapy (e.g. dobutamine) may be considered. 2 Consequently, vasopressor and/or inotropic therapy is frequently required in s-SAH patients. Central venous catheters (CVCs) are required for the safe administration of many vasopressors and inotropes, 3,4 but carry potentially serious morbidity and mortality risks, 5,6 particularly as the femoral insertion site is frequently chosen to avoid the theoretical risk of impaired venous drainage from the head in association with internal jugular vein CVC placement. 7 The authors observed that there was a difference in practice between consultants within the Department of Anaesthesia regarding the routine placement of CVCs in patients with s-SAH, prompting the study. Introduction: Secondary insults such as hypoxia-hypotension (HH) provide secondary brain damages and worsen neurologic outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Early identification of secondary insults with biomarkers could improve the characterization of TBI severity to better individualize treatment. Several biomarkers have been investigated in severe TBI; However, they have been poorly studied after secondary brain insults. Two of them appear to be particularly of interest 1 : Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1147, "end": 1148, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1345, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1811, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "Objective: Our objective was to describe the effects of a standardized secondary insult including hypoxia and hypotension on GFAP and UCH-L1 expression in rat brain in a model of severe diffuse TBI.

This consists of weekly, 2hour curriculum-mapped small group sessions attended by stage 1, 2 and 3 ICM trainees. During the pilot programme, 1 hour of each session was transferred to a simulation-based session, with scenario objectives designed to complement the teaching topic. At least 1 member of nursing staff was released from clinical duties to participate in the session. Other allied professionals were encouraged to attend. Each session required 1 confederate, 1 debriefer and 1 person to run the manikin.

There was no difference in APACHE II scores and mortality between VAP and non-VAP groups (p = 0.27 and p = 0.16 respectively). Predominant pathogens were H.Influenza, S.Aureus, enterobacter and klebsiella. Trauma patients had increased infection with H.Influenza (28 % vs. 12 %) and S.Aureus (36 % vs. 19 %). Trauma patients who developed VAP had higher mean injury severity scores (ISS) (34 vs. 27; p = 0.0004) and lower mean pre hospital Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) (7 vs. 9; p = 0.03) compared to trauma patients without VAP.

Dp/dt max transiently increased after resuscitation and decreased again in both groups, whereas dp/dt min and the isovolumic relaxation constant tau remained largely unaffected throughout the experiment despite high doses of NA and tachycardia. Together with the mostly unchanged ejection fraction, the fall in stroke volume and the rise in filling pressure (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) after re-transfusion indicate increased LV stiffness and dysfunction in both groups. However, all cardiac parameters and mitochondrial respiratory capacity of the heart did not show any significant differences between hyperoxic and control animals.

Therefore, hyperoxic treatment appears to be a safe approach for the treatment of O 2 deficiency in hemorrhagic shock even under conditions with preexisting cardiac comorbidity.

However, renal outcomes at in the longer term are not widely described in the literature and have never been described in Ireland. Objectives: We analysed all patients admitted to our tertiary ICU who were commenced on CRRT over a 2 year period. Our primary aim was to calculate the mortality of this cohort and estimate the likelihood of survivors requiring long-term dialysis. Our secondary aim was to analyse the characteristics of those requiring long-term dialysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A781"}, {"text": "Method: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients requiring CRRT admitted to our ICU between 2013 and 2015. From the Clinical Information System, we analysed patient age, sex, diagnosis, illness severity scores, pre-CRRT creatinine levels, AKIN scores, length of CRRT and ICU admission. Survivors with new onset renal failure were followed up at 6 and 12 months to determine survival, dialysis dependency and serum creatinine level. This study received ethical committee waiver. Results: Of 686 ICU admissions, 202 patients (29.4 %) received CRRT. 50 % of these patients died prior to hospital discharge. 85 patients had new onset renal failure and survived to hospital discharge. The 5 patients dialysed for toxin removal were excluded from further analysis. 11 patients (13.8 %) required ongoing CRRT at hospital discharge whereas 69 patients (86.2 %) did not. Of those requiring ongoing CRRT, 1 patient had died at 6 months, 2 further patients had died at 12 months, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 7 patients, 4 (57 %) were dialysis dependent at 12 months. Of the 69 patients who did not require RRT at hospital discharge, 12 had died at 6 months and 3 further patients had died at 12 month follow-up. 4 patients were lost to follow-up and a further 5 patients did not have blood results available. Of the remaining 45 patients, 100 % were not dialysis dependent at 12 months. Conclusions: The mortality rate for patients admitted to ICU and commenced on CRRT in our cohort was consistent with that in the international literature. The likelihood of requiring long-term dialysis for survivors was similarly consistent. This novel information is of value in the management and prognostication of patients requiring CRRT in an Irish ICU setting. group S (P < 0.05).

The occurrence of pneumonia in this population was also similar between the three groups of patients. there were no significant differences between the groups with regard to postoperative side effects.

Objectives: To analyze the ability of differents severity indexes (both general and specific) in predicting hospital and annual mortality of liver cirrhosis patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Methods: Retrospective observational study on a prospective database of 10 years duration. All patients were admitted consecutively with primary or secondary diagnosis of cirrhosis. The mortality prediction is performed by constructing ROC curves calculating the area under the curve (AUC) with confidence intervals at 95 % (95 % CI). Results: 229 patients were analyzed (mean age 58.6 \u00b1 13.1 years, and 78.6 % males) . The APACHE II index admission was 25 \u00b1 10 SAPS II 49 \u00b1 21 and 21 \u00b1 MELD index 9.

Rugerio Cabrera -The Americam British Cowdray Medical Center, Critical Care Department 'Dr. Mario Shapiro', Mexico City, Mexico Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A519Introduction: Acid-base status in a body fluid is physically determined by several \"independent variables\". These are: PCO 2 , the \"strong ion difference\" (SID) and all the strong anions (among them is Cl-), and concentrations of nonvolatile weak acids (Atot). Normal acid-base status is achieved when the independent variables have normal (empirically established) values. The Simplified Fencl-Stewart\u00b4s Method can be used at the bedside of the patient and is more accurate for the assessment of acid-base balance. Omron, E. developed a physicochemical model of the projected change in standard base excess (SBE) as a consequence of infused crystalloid solutions of common use (isotonic saline and balanced fluids); unfortunately this was a clinical simulation at standard physiological state. In addition, Kaplan, L. evaluated acid-base status after the administration of balanced fluids in trauma patients. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no other clinical trials that evaluate de administration of other types of balanced fluids. Objective: To assess acid-base status of critically ill patients after the infusion of seven different types of balanced solutions Methods: This was a retrospective, observational and descriptive study, conducted in an intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. We included all patients above 18 years old admitted to this department from January 2014 to December 2015. We evaluated the effects on acid-base balance after the infusion of seven different solutions: 1) Hartmann + 17.8 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) (SID 45.8), 2) Hartmann + 8.9 mEq/L NaHCO 3 (SID 36.9), 3) Hartmann + 15 mEq/L NaHCO 3 (SID 43), 4) Hartmann + 25 mEq/L NaHCO3 (SID 53), 5) Hartmann (SID 28), 6) normal saline 0.45 % + 77 mEq/L NaHCO 3 (SID 75), and 7) dextrose solution 5 % + 154 mEq/L NaHCO3 (SID 154", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF73": {"text": "Analgesia and sedation after limitation of life sustaining treatment thru terminal extubation.

Bird -University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A558Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately 8-23 % 1,2 of patients on neurointensive care units (NICU) and is an independent predictor of mortality, multiplying the risk of death by 6.17 times.1  The proportion of patients with chronic diseases is also increasing with a consequent increase in the number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) on neurointensive care units. The immediate availability of renal replacement therapy on NICUs in the UK may therefore have an increasingly important impact on the morbidity and mortality of brain injured patients in the future.Methods: A telephone survey of United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) adult NICUs was undertaken, with 16 questions to illicit the logistics of delivery of RRT to NICU patients. Results: Results were obtained from 81 % (25/31) of the adult neurosurgical centres in the NHS. Only 40 % (10/25) of centres have a dedicated NICU. Of these, only 4 had nursing staff trained to deliver RRT, with just 3 units possessing their own RRT equipment. 40 % (4/10) of the units with a dedicated NICU provided RRT on other intensive care units within the same hospital versus 33 % (5/15) of neurosurgical centres with mixed critical care patients. Some centres transferred their patients to other hospitals within the same trust for renal replacement therapy (30 % of dedicated NICUs versus none of the mixed intensive care units). 84 % (21/25) of units had < 30 patients a year requiring RRT.

Arnal -Hamilton Medical, Research and Development, Bonaduz, Switzerland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A602Introduction: Mechanical ventilation is associated with ventilation induced lung injuries (VILI) due to lung stress and lung strain. VILI can be prevented by limiting driving pressure (\u0394P) (1), plateau pressure (P PLAT ), and tidal volume (V T ). INTELLiVENT-ASV is a full closed loop ventilation solution that combines a ventilation and an oxygenation controller(2). The ventilation controller adjust minute volume to reach a target end tidal CO2 set by the user. Adaptive Support Ventilation (ASV) algorithm determines for a given minute volume the respiratory rate (RR) -V T combination associated with the minimal work of breathing(3). Recently, ASV algorithm has been modified in order to limit driving pressure (\u0394P)(4). Objectives: In order to determine if INTELLiVENT-ASV selects a lung protective ventilation, this prospective observational study reports on the applied ventilation parameters and blood gas results in passive ICU patients ventilated with INTELLiVENT-ASV in different lung conditions. Methods: Passive patients intubated and mechanically ventilated between June 2015 and March 2016 were included. Excluded were patients with bronchopleural fistula and brain dead patients. All patients were ventilated using a Hamilton Medical S1 ventilator in INTELLiVENT-ASV mode. Measurements were collected once for each patient during the first day of mechanical ventilation at the time of blood gas analysis. Airway pressure and flow were measured by the proximal flow sensor of the ventilator. P PLAT and total PEEP (PEEP TOT ) were measured by a 5 seconds end-inspiratory and end-expiratory occlusion, respectively. \u0394P was calculated as the difference between P PLAT and PEEP TOT .

An online questionnaire consisting of 37 questions was sent to nurses, residents and intensivists of seven ICUs in the Netherlands. Results: Out of 961 caregivers, 297 participated (30.9 % response rate), of which 267 responses were included. Communication difficulties are experienced in 50.0 % of the interactions with MV patients, resulting in 42.5 % of the professionals to lose valuable time on daily basis. More than 55 % of the participants indicated to lose between 30-60 minutes during an average shift. Consequently, 44.0 % indicated that their job satisfaction is negatively affected, primarily with feelings of unfulfillment (76.3 %) and frustration (70.8 %). To facilitate communication, 32.6 % reported to regularly use augmentative and alternative communication methods, but the most effective and preferred method remains the use of basic gestures. In addition, almost 50 % indicated to be dissatisfied with their personal communication skills with MV patients. Over 80 % of the caregivers have not been trained in communication with MV patients, while 72.0 % would like to receive training in the future. Conclusions: In half of the interactions with MV patients, health care professionals experience communication difficulties. These difficulties frequently lead to negative effects on patient care and job satisfaction of ICU professionals. This further emphasizes the need for improvements such as the development of communication protocols, skills training and continued research into new communication methods.

The SOFA initially used for the daily assessment of organ dysfunction in septic patients, was subsequently validated for serious patients in general, as a way of assessing daily dysfunction. The prognosis system SAPS3 (Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3) aims to establish a predictive mortality rate for patients admitted to Intensive Care Units (ICU). Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of the SAPS 3 and SOFA scores in the prognosis of cardiac patients admitted to the ICU of a general hospital in northeast region of Brazil. Methods: Prospective cohort study placed in a general ICU. In the study were included 54 patients with cardiac disease of 314 patients admitted patients to general ICU, from August 2015 and March 2016. All the patients were assessed using the SAPS 3 (Global Equation andCentral & South American Equation) and SOFA scoring systems. Logistic regressions analysis was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as well as the OR probability of mortality. The ability to predict mortality was performed with ROC curves. The differences between observed-to-predicted mortality were analyzed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: The study population had the following general characteristics: age 67 \u00b1 15.3 years, men 51.9 %, with a median time of 6 ), respectively. Calibration was confirmed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for SAPS 3-X2 = 0.1565 df: 8 (p = 0.99). Sensitivity to the SAPS 3 score and SOFA was 81.82 % and 100 %, and the specificity of the scores was 94.12 % and 79.41 % respectively. The corresponding negative predictive value to scores SAPS 3 and SOFA was 94.12 % (CI 95 % = 76.81-99.28) and 100 % (CI 95 % = 86.03-100.00). The corresponding positive predictive value to scores SAPS 3 was 84.12 % (CI 95 % = 53.45-97.72). Conclusions: The results showed that the scores can be effective in the prognostic assessment of cardiac patients admitted to a general ICU, with good calibration and adequate discrimination value.

Results: There were 923 incidences of oral cuffed ETT insertion above the age of 18 years in 750 patients and their intubation records were analysed. The median length of oral ETT was 22.2 cm in 600 males(SD 1.26)and mean length in 323 females was 21 cm (SD = 1.46).The mean length in all three ethnic groups of Chinese, Malay and Indians was 22 cm.

The workload measurement was performed to clarify how much extra time the bedside check added to the normal nursing task performance. We measured the frequency and time of the bedside check. The literature study was performed to find evidence of experiences and potential problems with the single check versus double check. Interviewing the pharmacist was to inquire the concerning double checks as well as supporting advice. Results: The workload measurement has been performed during four 8-hour shifts.

Crewdson -London's Air Ambulance, Pre-hospital Emergency Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A460Introduction: The benefits of pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA) are controversial. The timing of this intervention can be a difficult decision, particularly for conscious trauma patients with significant hypotension secondary to presumed hypovolaemia. Patients who are hypovolaemic prior to induction of anaesthesia are at risk of severe cardiovascular instability post induction, which may be difficult to manage. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the mortality rate for severely injured hypovolaemic trauma patients (without evidence of major neurological injury) undergoing PHEA with a patient cohort with the same physiology who were transported to hospital without PHEA. Methods: A five year retrospective database review of a physicianled pre-hospital trauma service was performed to identify trauma pa-Conclusions:Our results show an association between PHEA and mortality in awake hypotensive trauma patients, which is increased when hypotension is confirmed to be due to hypovolaemia. This study supports the hypothesis that where patients are hypovolaemic and awake on scene it might, where possible, be appropriate to delay induction of anaesthesia until after hospital arrival. To test the hypothesis that more intensive EMT will improve longer term physical outcome in the critically ill. Methods: A full trial protocol has been published 2 . We conducted a 3 centre RCT between January 2012 to July 2015. Eligible patients had received at least 48 hours of invasive ventilation before recruitment. The Intervention arm received up to 90 min per day of EMT Monday to Friday whilst the control arm received up to 30 min per day Monday to Friday. The primary trial outcome was the physical component of the SF-36 quality of life measure at 6 months after recruitment. Of the remaining 214 participants 116 completed and returned the SF-36 at 6 months. There was no significant difference in baseline demographics between survivors who completed the SF-36 and those who failed to respond. Full survival data were available for all participants via a national database. The total number of EMT session delivered to the Intervention group was higher than the standard group Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were obtained on admission and once weekly. We used ENVIN nosocomial infection criteria. We compared all patients admitted to ICU who acquired nosocomial ICU infections from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011 (non-SDD group) to the SDD study group. In both groups, categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages and the continuous ones as means and standard deviations (SD) when the data followed the normal distribution or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) when they did not. The percentages were compared using the test of chi-square test or Fisher exact test, means with the t-test and medians with the Wilcoxon test for independent samples. Those variables that showed statistical significance in the univariate analysis were introduced in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. For each one of the acquired infections (catheter-related and other secondary bacteremias, pneumonia and urinary infections and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) infections) the incidences per 1000 days of exposure in each cohort and the corresponding relative risks were obtained using the Poisson regression.

However, the metrics of GV might differ according to the frequency of measurement. Objectives: To evaluate the correlation between GV indices derived from intermittent glucose values and from CGM. Methods: A correlation between GV indices derived from intermittent readings (blood gas analyser[BGA]) and those derived from CGM was searched from data recorded in the same patients over the same period of time. Data from patients recruited for the MANAGE (Manual vs. Automated Monitoring Accuracy of Glucose) II trial between July 2012 and April 2014 were analysed. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years, expected ICU length of stay of \u2265 3 days, an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II \u2265 10, hyperglycemia >150 mg/dl at the time of admission and need for a central venous catheter, one lumen of which was connected to Optiscanner\u00ae (Optiscan, Hayward, CA), a validated mid-infrared spectroscopy method of glucose measure-ment. GV indices (standard deviation [SD], glucose variability index [GVI], glucose lability index [GLI], mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], J-index and maximal glucose change [MGC]) were calculated from blood glucose (in mg/dl) measured intermittently by BGA and by CGM over the same period. Pearson\u00b4s correlation coefficient between intermittent and CGM values was calculated for each metric. A Bland-Altman plot with bias (mean difference between the device and BGA measurements) and limits of agreement (bias \u00b1 1.96 x standard deviation of the bias) was used to analyse the agreement between the device and the BGA results. Results: Data from 88 patients were analysed. For each index, there was a significant correlation (p < 0.0001) between values calculated from intermittent readings and CGM. However, correlations were higher for J-index (0.96), SD (0.95) and GVI (0.9) than for MGC (0.88), GLI (0.82) and MAGE (0.77).

The glycemic control with insulin to maintain blood glucose (BG) within a narrow range as currently recommended involves repeated checks of BG. Near-continuous intravascular monitoring (CGM) can represent a useful tool to facilitate and to improve glycemic control. Objectives: To assess the effects of the use of CGM on the quality and safety of glycemic control. Methods: Adult critically ill patients expected to stay at least 3 days in the department of intensive care of the Erasme University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium and presenting an hyperglycemia (BG > 150 mg/ dl) up to 6 hours after admission and / or ongoing insulin therapy with a patent access to a large peripheral vein were equipped with a catheter connected to a enzymatic CGM sensor (GlucoClear\u00ae, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Two of the 4 units of the department were randomized to adjust insulin infusion rate to keep BG between 90 and 150 mg/dl (dynamic scale) using the values displayed on the monitor (unblinded group, U). In the 2 other units (blind group (B)), no value was displayed on the screen. The quality of glycemic control assessed by the proportion of time in range (TIR) and the safety assessed by the percentage of time spent below 70 mg/dl (TB70) were calculated from the values recorded by the CGM for each day and for the whole study period and compared between the two groups by ANOVA.

Metaxa King's College Hospital (Denmark Hill), Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Correspondence: L. Taheri -King's College Hospital (Denmark Hill), Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A522Introduction: Despite recent medical advances and improved survival, patients with haematological malignancies (HM) still have a high mortality, and end-of-life (EoL) care has become an integral part of their treatment.1  Evidence suggests less palliative care involvement and limited advanced care planning in patients with HM, probably because of the unclear transition between curative and palliative phases of their disease. 1,2 Critical Care Outreach Services (CCOS) have been shown to participate in more than 50 % of EoL planning as part of their everyday workload.3   Objectives: To evaluate the role and input of CCOS in EoL care of patients with HM. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with HM from January 2014 to October 2015 who were referred to CCOS in a London specialist hospital. Variables analysed included age, diagnosis, ICU admission, time spent by CCOS, interventions provided and in-hospital mortality. Results: There were 145 patients who were reviewed on 257 different occasions. Their age ranged from 18 to 84 years (median 56) and their diagnoses are shown inFig. 45. Of those, 16/145 (11 %) patients were identified as palliative; 81 % of them received EoL care on the ward. National Early Warning Scores at referral ranged from 2 to 10 (median 7). A total of 723 days was spent by CCOS in reviewing patients with HM, with 146 days (20 % of their clinical time) spent on palliative patients alone (median time 5.5d vs. 3d for non-palliative patients). Overall, in-hospital mortality among these patients was 81 %. The services provided by CCOS to palliative patients were mainly facilitation of symptom control (67 %) and/or support of ward teams in making treatment limitation decisions (78 %). High Flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen (HFNC) was initiated in 38 % of patients for symptom control, which was deemed successful in all but 2 patients. Conclusions: A considerable part of the CCOS workload is spent on supporting the management of palliative haematology patients. Involvement in alleviating symptoms and initiating EoL discussions features strongly in the interventions requested by the ward teams. The significant use of HFNC therapy for symptom control that was observed in this population also warrants further investigation.A523 Contact with death, ethical decisions, and communication of bad news in intensive care and palliative units: results from a mixedmethods study C.

However, while palliative care aims to reduce suffering, intensive care has a major focus on saving lives. Objectives: To identify and compare the experiences of ICU and PCU healthcare professionals related to: contact with dying and death, making of ethical decisions and communication and delivery of bad news.Methods: Mixed approach, combining quantitative (questionnaire on experiences in the work context) and qualitative ones (interviews with doctors and nurses). 10 ICU and 9 PCU participated in this study. 392 professionals completed the survey; 28 were interviewed. A descriptive quantitative analysis was performed; the chi-square test was used to analyse the association between variables (significance level of p < .05). Interviews were subject to content analysis. Results: In the week prior to survey completion, more professionals working in ICUs reported a patient's death; this was not statistically significant. The experience most mentioned by the professionals of both types of units during interviews was caring for patients nearing death. In the week before completing the questionnaire, the most common ethical decision was palliative/terminal sedation; this was more, often in ICUs (27 % vs. 12 %; p = .004). In the day of questionnaire completion, the most frequent ethical decision was also palliative sedation. Though this decision was more frequent in ICU,Fig. 45 (abstract A522).statistical significance was not reached (p = .440). The communication of the diagnosis/prognosis to the patient, either in the week before or in the day of questionnaire completion was more frequent in PCUs (45 % vs. 29 %, p = .005; 22 % vs. 12 %, p = .026, respectively). Communication about the diagnosis/prognosis with the family in the week before survey completion was held with equal frequency by professionals from both contexts (58 % of professionals). Although not reaching statistical significance (p = .303), more professionals from PCU proceeded to communication with family about the diagnosis and prognosis (32 % vs. 26 %) in the survey day. From the analysis of the interviews, it was denoted that it were mainly professionals of PCU who referred to the communication on the diagnosis/ prognosis, both with the patient as with the family.Conclusions: The workplace experiences in ICU and PCU are, despite some differences, guided by similarities. Caring for patients with lifethreatening situations and imminent death and the need to make ethical decisions occur frequently in both contexts. The communication about the diagnosis/prognosis occurs more often in PCU. This highlights the need for integrating communication strategies of palliative care, in intensive care. 1.

Data were extracted from hospital and ICU databases, including patient demographics, preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, length of ICU stay, mortality and presence of advance directives. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to test the predictive validity of ASA for a) having an ICU stay > 24 h and b) dying in the ICU or afterwards. Optimal cut-offs were identified by maximum Youden's J statistic. Results: Among 1832 patients, 937 (51 %) were male, median age was 63 years (interquartile range 49-74), planned procedures were mainly from General, Trauma, Cardiothoracic, Eye, Gynecological, Urological or ENT Surgery. Pre-operatively, patients were classified into ASA risk classes (15 %, 41 %, 40 % and 4 % into ASA 1-4, respectively). Postoperatively, 504 (28 %) patients were admitted to the ICU. Of these, 373 (74 %) had an ICU LOS > 24 hours and 68 (13 %) died in the ICU or afterwards. Among patients with an ICU stay > 24 hours, presence of an AD was documented in 49 (15 %) and power of attorney for a legal proxy in 71 (22 %). Pre-operative ASA classification predicted an ICU stay >24 h with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, and death in the ICU or afterwards with an AUC of 0.85. The optimal cut-off for both adverse outcomes was ASA \u2265 3. For ICU stay >24 h sensitivity was 0.85, specificity was 0.67; for death in or after ICU sensitivity was 0.93 and specificity was 0.58. Conclusions: Preoperative ASA classification with a cut-off of \u2265 3 has a good predictive validity to identify the risk of prolonged ICU stay or death in patients undergoing elective surgery. Such risk stratification could be useful to initiate advance decision-making at the time of the pre-operative work-up of these patients and thus increase the prevalence of adequate ADs in the ICU.Grant acknowledgement Funded partially by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany, grant no: 01EO1002.Introduction: Studies have shown variations in practice across hospitals regarding treatment-limitations and mortality for brain-injured patients. Objectives: To study treatment-limitations and associated mortality in a Norwegian trauma hospital and documentation of ethical aspects such as presence of advanced directives, dialogue with families, multi-team discussions, reasons and considerations behind decisions, conflicts and involvement of clinical ethics committees. Methods: A retrospective study of a 2-year cohort of severe head injured patients admitted 2011-12 to Oslo university hospital, Norway. Trauma registry data were combined with data from medical records. For data validation a definition guide for study variables was developed. Adults with abbreviated injury score head 4,5,6 were included (n = 579). Results: Eighty-five % of all patients were admitted to ICU. Treatment limitations were identified in 17 % of cases (101 patients). Decisions were: Withholding organ support (12 cases), withholding surgery (52 cases), withdrawing intracranial pressure-targeted therapy (23 cases), DNR-orders (44 cases), no-escalation of treatment (19 cases) or withdrawing organ support (44 cases). For some patients initial decisions were changed (19 cases) or revoked (3 cases) along the dynamic treatment trajectory. Twenty-six patients with devastating brain injury progressed to brain death. No patients had advanced directives. Dialogue with family was documented in most cases (98). No major conflict between families and treatment team was identified and there was no involvement by CEC. Rationale behind decisions was identified as medical only in 80 % of cases. Treatment-limitations followed situations categorized as futile (59 cases) or \"potentially inappropriate treatment\" (42 cases) (1). The overall 30-day mortality was 16 % (35 % for patient with GCS < 9 and 7,5 % for patients with GCS >8). Treatmentlimitations were identified in 93 % of cases of in-hospital death. Inhospital mortality was 73 %, 30-day mortality 82 % and 2-year mortality 93 % in the treatment-limiting group (n = 101 patients, 25 patients were transferred to other facilities with limitations). In-hospital mortality was 1 %, 30-day mortality 2 % and 2-year mortality 8 % for patients without limitations made at the trauma hospital (n = 478). Conclusions: Treatment limitations are common in patients with traumatic brain injury and were closely associated with in-hospital death. Withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy in this early phase of hospitalization was primarily based on the medical situation and at the discretion of the physician. Whether patients' values and preferences were adequately addressed or had an impact on decisions (when appropriate) remains unclear.A526 Ethical considerations when performing life saving but non restorative neurosurgical intervention.

Also we want to find out what happened to this patients after intensivist evaluation. Design: Observational and prospective study during 12 consecutive months. Scope: Second level Hospital with 550 beds and 18 ICU boxes. Method: We searched daily for patients who were assessed but not admitted to ICU during 12 consecutive months. We write down medical record number, which of the hospital departments asked for that ICU evaluation and the reason why the patient was not finally admitted to ICU (low severity, life-sustaining treatment limitation or not ICU bed availability). We follow up those patients until hospital discharged, finding either decease, hospital discharge or later ICU admission. Results: 1297 patients were assessed but not admitted to ICU. 91 were finally admitted to ICU later (12.3 %) and 125 patients died (16.9 %). 102 patients were not admitted because of no ICU bed availability, majority were treated in Observation Room in Emergency Department (N = 94, 92.2 %); 29 of them were admitted to ICU later (28.4 %) and 20 died (19.6 %). Conclusions: From these results we conclude that maybe the lack of beds in ICU can generate a belated admission to ICU and higher mortality rate in recoverable patients. One third of patients with a life-sustaining treatment limitation decision finally survive the hospitalization. Also we conclude that a considerable amount of intensivist clinical assistance during the shifts takes place outside de ICU.A528 Oddicus -how much care is at odds with patient's values and preferences at the end of life?

Objectives: The aim of the present study was to analyze the degree of compliance of the six bioethics quality indicators in Spanish ICU. Methods: Multicenter survey in Spanish ICU. During a time of 30 days a questionnaire was sent to local investigators of ICU. Question were related with the six bioethics quality indicators published by SEMI-CYUC: Indicator 96: Adequacy of care at the end of the life. Indicator 97: Information to patients and their relatives in ICU. Indicator 98: advance directives in decision makings. Indicator 99: Informed written consent forms corrected filled out . Indicator 100: Limitation life support. Indicator 101: Restraints applications. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 15 for Windows. Results: 68 ICU participate. 50 belongs to public health services and 14 with other financial management. 70,6 % were university hospitals. Indicator 96: 44 % have end of life protocol available.

Barbosa -Algarve Hospital Center, Faro Unit, Emergency and Intensive Care Department, Faro, Portugal Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A531 Introduction: Despite technological advances that allow the support of organ and prolongs life, death in intensive care units is frequent. However, the success of care should not only be measured by survival, but should include the quality of life of each patient who survives and the comfort of the terminally ill. Objectives: To evaluate the comprehension of nurses and physicians concerning end-of-life decisions.Methods: The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey with a self-completed questionnaire applied to nurses and physicians on a voluntary and anonymous basis. The questionnaire was constructed around the meaning of end-of-life decisions: withdrawal and withhold life-sustaining treatments and do not resuscitate decisions.Results: A total of 174 questionnaires were delivered and 109 were returned (response rate of 63 %). However, two of the questionnaires were excluded by multiple responses to each question. Seventy-one percent were nurses, 29 % were physicians and 59 % were female; the median age was 35 years-old and the median years of practicing was 11; 64 % had religious beliefs (53 % of the physicians and 68 % of the nurses). The comprehension of end-of-life decisions was noted in 86 % of the physicians and nurses: 93 % comprehended the meaning of withdrawal and withhold life-sustaining treatments and 97 % comprehended the meaning of do not resuscitate decision. There were no significant statistical differences in the comprehension of end-of-life decisions between physicians and nurses. The religious belief was a factor significantly associated with poor comprehension of end-of-life decisions (p 0,044), namely withhold life-sustaining treatment.Conclusions: In this study, we found that not all physicians and nurses of an emergency and intensive care department comprehend the meaning of end-of-life decisions. Religious belief was significantly associated with poor comprehension of en-of-life decisions, namely withhold life-sustaining treatment. This study draws our attention to the need to improve training and education about end-of-life decisions in the emergency and intensive care units and to conduct further studies to evaluate the comprehension of the nurses and physicians on other departments of the hospital.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF65": {"text": "abstract A529).

Introduction: Withholding or withdrawal has been reported in 19-50 % of deaths in Indian ICUs, withdrawal being limited to only 8 % of cases 1 . Various reasons have been identified as barriers to end of life care in India 2 . A recent physician interview based Asian multinational study has highlighted significant difference in such practices 3 . Objectives: This study was undertaken to look at the attitude of Indian families towards end of life care (EOL) issues. Methods: A standard protocol for family discussion was developed. Relevant end of life care issues was discussed in presence of admitting physician, ICU nurse, medical administrator and members of ICU team. The filled up EOL family discussions forms related to 44 critically ill adult patients admitted to ICU between March 2010 & March 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The discussions held during nonregular hours were excluded. All families participated in end of life care discussions. They understood and agreed on a situation of medical futility and irreversibility in their loved ones and 79.54 % (n = 35) families requested for no further escalation in treatment. 43 % (n = 19) families agreed for No CPR orders, whereas 20.45 % (n = 9) agreed for Do not intubate and do not ventilate orders. Only 4.54 % (n = 2) families agreed for withdrawal of ventilator, 9 % agrees for withdrawal of vasopressors and only 1 family (2.27 %) agreed for organ donation. Majority of the families (90.9 %, n = 40) tried to understand the measures given to alleviate pain and the feeling of dyspnoea related to ventilator withholding or withdrawal. Conclusions: Our study shows willingness of families to participate in end of life care discussions and accepting medical futility and irreversibility of such situations. Withholding life care was more acceptable than withdrawing.

Objectives: To describe severity and comorbidity relationship with early mortality in patients admitted in ICU.To analyze differences in patients early died in ICU according limitation of life-sustaining therapy (LST) decisions. Methods: Observational study in an ICU of a community hospital. Time of study: 12 months. Inclusion criteria were patients who died within the first 48 hours of ICU admission. The variables analyzed were age, sex, comorbidity Charlson index, APACHE II and lactate levels at ICU admission. Two groups of patients were compared according LST decisions. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 18 for Windows. Results: 65 consecutive patients were analyzed. In 23 % limitation of life sustaining therapy was decided.Table 24shows the differences between the patients who died with and without LST, lactate levels at ICU admission were 96.1 and 43.2 mg/dl in Not LST group and LST group respectively. There were not observed differences in reason of admission. Conclusions: Predominant clinical profile of patients died early in ICU was elderly patient with high comorbidity, APACHE II and lactate levels at admission. Limitation of life-sustaining therapy decisions were not associated with severity parameters.

The data was taken from ACUBASE electronic notes and CCU monitoring charts of the relevant cases and analysed using Microsoft EXCEL. Out of the 217 deaths in CCU 81 (37.3 %) were due to withdrawal of treatment. We had found the excellent documentation regarding family discussion (93.8 %) and formal decision of withdrawal of support (83.9 %). All the patients (100 %) had valid DNACPR form. The documentation of method of withdrawal was 59.2 %, on the other hand the treatment limitation on admission as advanced care plan, documentation of patient discussion about EOL, consideration of spiritual aspect, time of withdrawal, organ donation were documented in 22 %,2 %,12 %,16 % and 30 % of cases respectively. In the method of withdrawal we audited the organ supports and symptom relief medications. Only 73 % of the patients had analgesics and 26 % had sedatives during the process of dying.

Detecting patients, who present with an ADHF and signs of superimposed pneumonia, is difficult because of the nonspecific nature of physical examination or chest x-ray abnormalities in the setting of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Nahm et al. developed neutrophil delta neutrophil index (DNI) as a new indicator for immature neutrophils and DNI expression is induced by bacterial infection. Objectives: No information is available on the clinical usefulness of DNI with respect to the diagnosis of superimposed pneumonia in patients with ADHF. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of difference of initial DNI according to presence of pneumonia in patients with ADHF, the predictive value of DNI and the usefulness of DNI in combination with C-reactive protein (CRP), which is the commonly used for predicting inflammation and infection in the ED, for diagnosis of superimposed pneumonia in patients presenting with ADHF at the ED.Methods: This is a retrospective and observational study of consecutive patients more than 18 years of age who were diagnosed with an ADHF in the ED over a 7 month period.

It is very important to improve the health care professionals' knowledge and awareness on organ donation and transplantation along with the safety and quality of donor organs. Objectives: The main goal of the TNA Study was to identify weak points or 'gaps' in the professional's knowledge in organ donation and transplantation procedures in Turkey. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted via both qualitative and quantitative research methods during April 2013-May 2014. The questionnaire was related to obstacles, strengths, weaknesses and opportunities in the Turkish donor programme. The main purpose of the interview was to obtain in-depth insight into the training needs of Turkish transplant experts. The results of the interviews revealed that lack of knowledge, awareness, responsibility and positive attitude towards about BD diagnosis and organ donation process of medical staff and nurses.

LPS administration did not result in a statistically significant increase either in PCT or the assessed liver markers when compared to control.Conclusions: APAP and LPS administration did not result in a significant increase in PCT in this in vitro model of APAP toxicity. APAP concentrations might have been too low to induce enough cell necrosis and consecutive inflammation, although our experiments were based on APAP concentrations that are clinically relevant and found in APAP overdose patients.Introduction: Recently, it has been proposed \"LiFe\" score as a quick, easy and useful tool for evaluating patients with severe liver disease admitted at ICU area. Objectives: To assess the validity and usefulness of the score \"LiFe\" in patients with liver disease requiring admission in Intensive Care Medicine of our environment. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with liver disease admitted from May 2013 to October 2015. The following variables were analyzed: origin of liver disease, cause of decompensation, SOFA, APACHE II, SAPS II, MELD, lactate, bilirubin, INR (calculating \"LiFe\" score), mortality and mortality at 30 days. Results: 113 patients, 73.5 % men and 26.5 % women, mean age 57.42 \u00b1 10.21 (34-85) were included. The severity scores: APACHE II 21.18 \u00b1 9.38 (5-50), SAPS 51.55 \u00b1 19.7 (10-116), 10.28 \u00b1 6.8 SOFA (1-24), MELD at admision18.82 \u00b1 9.63). The mean values of lactic acid, bilirubin and INR: lactate 3.88, bilirubin 4,90, INR 1.82. The score \"LiFe\" of the sample is 2.75 \u00b1 2.62 (0-10), stratifying at: 20.4 % low risk, 45.1 % intermediate risk, 24.8 % high risk and 3.5 % very high risk .

Methods: In this retrospective analysis we included patients listed for LT with KALT bonus at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, during a period of 05/2011 -05/2015. Results: 78 patients (female: 38 %, age: median 59 yrs, IQR 51-65) were included in the study. Median length of stay at intensive care unit was 16 days (IQR 7-37). 28 patients (36 %) needed renal replacement therapy (RRT) pre-LT. Median serum creatinin of those without need for RRT was 2,5 mg/dl (IQR 1,3-3,8 mg/dl). Post-LT 46 patients (59 %) required RRT. Only 7 patients (9 %) remained with terminal dialysis-dependent kidney insufficiency -4 due to hepatorenal syndrome, 3 due to preexisting chronic renal insufficiency of other causes. 2 patients (3 %) received a kidney transplant (KT) during the predetermined period of KALT bonus of 360 days. Another 5 patients remained with need for RRT after expiry of the KALT option. One of them underwent RT in the Eurotransplant-senior-program. 4 (57 %) of these 7 patients had already been on RRT pre-LT. Overall mortality rate of those without necessity of RRT pre-LT was 36 %, and 39 % in those with requirement of RRT pre-LT. In total 29 (37 %) of 78 patients died during follow-up. 38 % of these patients required RRT pre-LT, whereas 80 % needed RRT post-LT. Conclusions: 9 % (7/78) of patients undergoing LT with an option for KALT remained long-lasting with need for RRT. Only 3 % (2/78) received a kidney graft during the predetermined period of KALT option, whereas 5 (6 %) patients remained with necessity for RRT and subsequent need for KT. In these 6 % of LT-patients KALT allocation system was not effective with respect to prioritize patients for early KT.A691 Bilirubin removal with a new adsorbent system: in vitro and in vivo study S.

At present, extracorporeal systems for this purpose are based instead on plasma-adsorption. Objectives: We designed an in vitro and in vivo study. The in vitro study evaluated the system's adsorption capacity of bilirubin and the ability to remove protein-bound solutes, while the in vivo study verified the congruence between in vitro and in vivo results and clinical outcomes. Methods: The in vitro study included 3 tests. Two tests were carried out with equimolar solution of Albumin(Alb)-Bilirubin(Bil), containing unconjugated Bil, strongly Alb-bound[1], to verify removal of proteinbound solutes.Test 3, 24 h long, was performed with higher concentration of Bil and lower of Alb, to study the kinetics of adsorption. The in vivo study is currently enrolling patients with severe hepatic dysfunction with hyperbilirubinemia. Primary outcome is to evaluate in vivo Bil removal, whereas secondary outcomes are the hemodynamic stabilization, the reduction of inotropes, ithe mprovement of hepatic function and inflammatory status.

Determination of clearance of indocyanine green (ICG) has been proposed as a good method to measure liver function in diferent scenarios. Objective: To evaluate the capability of ICG elimination as a marker of development of graft dysfunction, kidney dysfunction or mortality. Material: Protective observational study. Series of cases. In our patients we measured PDR and R-15 after a dose of 0,5 mgr/Kg IV of ICG by means of the Limon monitor (Pulsion\u00ae) the first day after OLT. We looked the relationship with AKIN-III, graft dysfunction (modified Toronto criteria) and in-hospital mortality. Analysis was performed by chi-square, Student t-test and area under curve (AuC). Results: 39 patients, age 55.7 \u00b1 11.3 years, 66,7%men. Mean hospital stay was 18.8 \u00b1 16 days. APACHE II at admission 13.8 \u00b1 3.6, SOFA 7.1 \u00b1 3.4, lactate 1.8 \u00b1 1.2 mm/L and PDR 19.5 \u00b1 14.5 %. In 15.4%patients a mild dysfunction was detected, without associated mortality and 20.5 % developed severe dysfunction with a mortality of 37.55. In 15,4 % patients AKIN-3 was detected with a mortality of 7.7 %.

Nanas 1 , G. Briassoulis 2 Introduction: The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is ubiquitously expressed on nearly all cell types, but tissue-specific deletion of this receptor can produce dramatic whole organism phenotypes. Recent data provide evidence that GR expression is progressively decreased in experimental sepsis and that dexamethasone has a decreased ability to translocate into the cell nucleus 1 . Objectives: To evaluate the protein expression of the GR in peripheral blood monocytes (m) and neutrophils (n) and the GR isoform a (GRa) mRNA in whole blood in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with early-onset severe sepsis (SS) or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) compared to healthy control subjects (H). To relate their expression with serum levels of prolactin, cortisol and interleukins, plasma levels of ACTH, and to the expression of intracellular heat shock proteins 72 (HSP72) and HSP90\u03b1. Methods: Consecutively admitted patients with early (first 48 hours) SS (n = 48) or SIRS (n = 40) were admitted to a University Hospital ICU and enrolled in the study. 35 H were included. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples and cDNA was prepared. RT-PCR was performed using Light Cycler 480 Probes Master kit, employing primers and Taqman probes specifically designed for NR3C1 (GR\u03b1) and RPLP0 (used as control gene), on Light Cycler 480 System (Roche). Monocytes and neutrophils protein expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) values for HSPs and GR were measured after staining surface antigens CD33 and CD45 with CD33-PE/Cy5 and CD45-PE/Cy7 followed by intracellular staining with HSP72-FITC, HSP90a-PE or GR-FITC using 4-colour flow cytometry. Prolactin and cortisol were measured using the ADVIA centaur system, ACTH using Immulite 2000. ELISA was used to evaluate interleukins. Results: GR MFI was significantly higher in SS compared to SIRS and H (p < 0.01) and was related to mHSP90\u03b1 (p < 0.0001), nHSP90\u03b1 (p < 0.0001), mHSP72 (p < 0.02), cortisol (p < 0.03), and IL-6 (p < 0.005).Methods: 21 patients (43 % M, 57 % F, 66 y) admitted to our ICU with a diagnosis of SS were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were: endstage heart failure and liver disease, severe active cancer, age < 18 years, pre-existent hematological disorders, ongoing anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. 21 healthy volunteers, age and sex matched, were recruited to establish references values for MPs. Circulating MPs levels were measured at baseline (day 0) and 24 hours later (day 1) by size and Annexin V-FITC labelling, using flow-cytometer. Endothelial MP were identified using CD62E-PE monoclonal antibody[2]. The SOFA-score was determined over the first 24 hours and 28-day mortality was recorded. Data were expressed as medians, IQR or percentages. Correlations were assessed using Spearmann \u03c1. T-test was used for comparison between groups. Results: In critically ill patients V + Annexin and E selectin + MPs were Conclusion Our preliminary data showed that endothelial MPs and V Annexin + MPs could be useful biomarkers of vascular damage. E selectin + MPs were strongly correlated to disease severity and renal failure. Sepsis-induced AKI probably occurs in the setting of a more severe microvascular dysfuction. Our results confirmed an important endothelial alteration, probably due to an abnormal release of E selectin + MPs, during sepsis-induced AKI. In conclusion, MPs may be important therapeutic targets to prevent or treat SS.A698 Impact of initial lactate level on ed management of patients with sepsis: a multicenter retrospective cohort study H.

Objectives: To examine the role of initial lactate level in the management of sepsis in the emergency department (ED).Study design: A multi-centre retrospective cohort study Patient population: All inpatients with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock with initial lactate level drawn in the ED from July 2011 to July 2015. Study centres: ED of three community acute care centres in the Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada. Data collection: A dedicated Regional Sepsis Coordinator collected data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, investigations and managements. Institutional research ethics board approval was obtained. Results: A total of 2082 patients were included in the study. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 60-81), and the mean initial lactate level was 3.48 \u00b1 2.63 mmol/L. Door-to-antibiotics time decreased from 194 \u00b1 156 min in the normal lactate group to 138 \u00b1 135 min in the high lactate group (p < 0.05). Total fluid administration in first 6 hours increased from 1.9 \u00b1 1.3 L in the normal lactate group to 3.2 \u00b1 1.9 L in the high lactate group (p < 0.05). Central line insertion rates increased from 8.8 % in normal lactate group to 47.8 % in the high lactate group (p < 0.05). Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate increased from 25.4 % in normal lactate group to 54.5 % in high lactate group (p < 0.05). Unadjusted in-hospital mortality for normal, low, intermediate and high lactate group was 13.9 %, 21.7 %, 32.9 % and 57.2 %, respectively. Conclusions: Higher initial lactate level correlates with more intensive ED management of sepsis including earlier antibiotics administration, more fluid resuscitation, increase chance of central line insertion and ICU admission. It also correlates with higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality rate.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF156": {"text": "abstract A698). Summary of resultsIntroduction: Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) has been suggested as an intermediate process between tracheobronchial colonization and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Creactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate between VAT and VAP on the day of infection diagnosis. Methods: Post-hoc analysis of the large prospective multinational TAVeM database, coming from 114 ICUs in Europe and Latin America (1). All consecutive patients receiving mechanical ventilation for >48 h were included in the TAVeM database. We compared VAT and VAP at the day of infection diagnosis. Only first episodes of VAT and VAP were taken into account. Results: Four hundred and four patients (mean age 60 years, 238 men, ICU mortality 35 %) were studied, 207 with VAT and 197 with VAP. On the day of infection diagnosis, the median CRP was elevated in both groups but significantly higher in VAP (14 mg/dl and 18 mg/ dl, p = .001). PCT was also significantly higher in VAP (0.64 ng/dl and 2.1 ng/dl, p < .001). However, roughly 25 % VAT patients and 16 % of VAP patients had PCT values < 0.25 ng/dl, while 14 % VAT patients and 7 % of VAP patients had CRP values < 4.0 mg/dl. Dividing the patients in sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, the levels of PCT were significantly different between the three groups (p = 0.008) and that was not the case for CRP (p = 0.097). Conclusions: Both CRP and PCT in patients with suspected ventilator associated lower respiratory tract infection were higher in VAP than VAT. PCT presented a higher false negative rate. The level of PCT showed a good correlation with clinical severity.Objectives: Our aim was to investigate the evolution of blood lactate level over time and its relationship to 90-day mortality in critically ill septic patients with hypotension and in patients with septic shock according to the recently revised definition. Methods: We performed a post-hoc analysis from the prospective, observational, multicenter FINNAKI study. We analyzed 513 septic patients with hypotension, lactate recordings within 4 hours of ICU admission and repeat recordings of lactate during the ICU. 265 patients fulfilled the new definition for septic shock. The primary outcome was the association of time-weighted mean lactate during ICU stay with 90-day mortality. Results: The 90-day mortality for all patients was 33.3 %. In patients with admission lactate of > 2 mmol/L the 90-day mortality was higher than in those with an admission lactate of \u2264 2 mmol/L (43.In separate backwards logistic regression analyses time-weighted mean lactate, the lactate value at 72 hours, and a lactate value over 2 mmol/L at 72 hours (dichotomous variable) were independently associated with 90-day mortality, but admission lactate or time to normalization of lactate were not. Conclusions: In septic patients with hypotension, and in those who additionally had hyperlactatemia, time-weighted mean lactate, lactate values at 72 hours, and persisting hyperlactatemia at 72 hours were independently associated with 90-day mortality, but time to normalization of lactatemia and admission lactate were not.A702 Adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 are associated with myocardial injury and death in septic shock patients O.H.M.

On multivariate analysis, the odds of 28-day mortality were 8.16(95 % CI: 0.2-275) in the LH group, 1.46 (95 % CI: 0.05-26.8) in the HH group, and 1.34 (95 % CI: 0.17-11.1) in the LL group.Conclusions: Mortality at 28 days was highest in the LH group and lowest in the HL group. These data are not conflicted our experience and past studies. Because 28-day mortality was higher in the HH group than in the LL group, it is possible that lactate levels are more predictive of mortality.showed a good performance for prognosis of in-hospital mortality, with AUC ROC > 0.8 for both, they did not improve the value of severity scores usually used in ICUs.A706 Diagnostic value of systemic interleukin-1 receptor antagonist for ventilator associated pneumonia in a porcine model of mechanical ventilation G.

Study treatments significantly changed INF-\u03b3, IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-18 concentrations (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Multivariate analyses showed that cytokines did not predict VAT; yet, IL-1Ra was strongly associated with VAP (odds ratio 64.941 (CI 1.638 -\u227b 999), area under the ROC curve 0.85 (0.64-1.00). A value of 1.21 log pg/mL appeared to diagnose VAP most accurately (sensitivity 90 %, specificity 80 %). Conclusions: In a reliable animal model of MV and acquired pulmonary infections, IL-1Ra predicts P.aeruginosa VAP with good diagnostic accuracy. Consistently with previous findings, the Trendelenburg position reduced incidence of VAP, and decreased inflammation during MV.

Arib -Hopital Erasme, Department of Intensive Care, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A712Introduction: In patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), monitoring brain metabolism through microdialysis catheters has revealed a decrease in brain glucose concentrations during intensive insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia. However, the use of such catheters is not routinely applied. No data are available on glucose concentrations into the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of these patients during insulin therapy (IT). Methods: We reviewed data in all patients admitted after a nontraumatic SAH over a 4-year period (2011-2014) in 5 ICUs. Inclusion criteria were: a) age > 18 years; b) presence of an external ventricular drain (EVD) for intracranial pressure monitoring; c) daily analysis of CSF including glucose concentrations for at least 4 consecutive days; d) concomitant analysis of glucose concentrations on the arterial blood gas analysis. Demographics and clinical characteristics were recorded on admission as well as the need for continuous IT (target glucose levels: 110-150 mg/dL) and 3-month neurological outcome (favourable outcome was defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale of 4-5). Results: Of a total of 724 patients admitted with SAH, 335 needed an EVD and 144 met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis (median age: 58 [49-66] years; male gender: 77/144). Median time from admission to EVD placement was 1 [0-3] days; EVD was maintained for a period of 7 [4-12] days. Of the 115 identified aneurysms, 83 were treated with endovascular therapy. Median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was 10 [7-13] and CT-scan Fisher scale was 4 [3-4]. A total of 46 (32 %) died during the ICU stay and 63 (44 %) had a favourable neurological outcome. Patients receiving IT on the first day of EVD monitoring (n = 72) had more frequently diabetes (27/72 vs. 4/72; p < 0.001) but similar GCS and Fisher scales than those without IT. Together with a higher CSF red blood cells count (65210 [11900-94192] vs. 24650 [6020-64188]/mm 3 ; p = 0.006) and similar white blood cells and proteins levels, patients receiving IT had higher blood glucose (180 [151-222] vs. 140 [118-155] mg/dL; p < 0.001) and similar CSF glucose concentrations (89 [66-108] vs. 81 [72-92] mg/dL; p = 0.13) than those without IT. Thus, the ratio between CSF and blood glucose levels was significantly lower in patients receiving IT than others (0.51 [0.36-0.61] vs. 0.60 [0.49-0.70]; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Insulin therapy resulted in lower proportion of glucose available in the CSF in patients with SAH. The impact of such findings on cerebral recovery and outcome needs to be further evaluated. A713 Serial MRI for outcome prediction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage S. Magnoni 1 , M.

Demographics and clinical characteristics were recorded on admission as was the need for continuous insulin therapy (IT; target glucose levels: 110-150 mg/dL) and 3-month neurological outcome (unfavourable outcome was defined as an extended Glasgow Outcome Scale of 1-4). Results: Of 151 patients TBI patients who needed an EVD, 56 met the inclusion criteria (median age: 37 [26-59] years; male: 40). Most EVDs were placed on the day of ICU admission and they were maintained for 10[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] days. Median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was 7 [3-10] and most initial CT-scans were classified as V or VI in the Marshall score (54/57). Twenty (36 %) patients died during the ICU stay and 23 (41 %) had a favourable neurological outcome. Patients who received IT (n = 47) on the first day of EVD monitoring had similar blood and CSF glucose concentrations than those who did not (n = 9). CSF and blood glucose levels were similar in survivors and non-survivors, but non-survivors had higher CSF lactate levels (4.] mmol/L; p = 0.03) on the first CSF analysis. The CSF glucose/lactate ratio was lower in the non-survivors than in the survivors (1.0 [0.8-1.7] vs. 1.9 [1.4-2.4]; p =0.008). Similar results were found when patients with an unfavourable neurological outcome were compared with the other patients. Conclusions: Non-surviving patients after TBI have initially higher CSF lactate levels and a lower CSF glucose/lactate ratio than survivors. These observations suggest a more profound metabolic brain distress in the non-survivors, who may benefit from an alternative energetic substrate to glucose.A719 In patients with acute spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage admitted to the intensive care unit, what proportion require vasopressor and/or inotropic support, and what proportion require central venous catheterization?

PbtO2 MNT is not that frequent, despite studies supporting its use. Given the link between hypoxia and a bad outcome, we accept that correcting brain hypoxia may improve the final result. Objectives: To identify to what extent survival and level of dependence (analysed by GOS at 6 months, GOS-6) of neurocritical patients (NCP) are affected by the time under certain levels of PbtO2, with simultaneous normal ICP value. Methods: Retrospective study. NCP admitted to our ICU (2011-15) underwent ICP + PbtO2 MNT . Registered data, among others, were: VAR) were analysed, 5 of which reached statistical relevance. We focused on the following items: T1: Time (h) with ICP > 20; T2: Time (h) with PbtO2 < 5; and combined VAR: T10: Time (h) with ICP < 20 + PbtO2 < 10; T15: Time (h) with ICP < 20 + PbtO2 < 15; T20: Time (h) with ICP < 20 + PbtO2 < 20. STATISTYCAL ANALYSIS. We conducted the study in two phases. FIRST: we compared NCP who survived with those who did not, focusing on critical values of PbtO2 and ICP. SECOND: we analysed differences between gr 1 and 2 for variables T10, T15 and T20. After obtaining data descriptive, for each one of them, we applied parametric statistic tests. The arithmetic mean was the starting point. To compare means we used t Student and Welch robust test. Then we conducted a logistic regression analysis to evaluate to what extent each VAR affects outcome or dependence. For gr 2 and 3 we performed Kaplan-Meier analysis, to compare the relationship between outcome and the time that each type of patient required to reach a specified goal of PbtO2 (10, 15 and 20). Results: 49 NCP were included (63.3 % men); mean age: 50 (s.d.14,92). The main results of the 1st phase are shown inTable 74. The risk of death vs no death increases 5.8 % with every h with high ICP. The risk of death vs no death increases 24 % with every h with PbtO2 < 5 and normal ICP. The results of T10, T15 and T20 VAR are shown inTable 75. The probability of being highly vs low dependent increases 5.4 % every h with PbtO2 < 15, given normal ICP. For variable T10, differences are nearly but not definitely statistically significant. Finally, for VAR T10 and T15, Kaplan Meier estimator was applied, (results shown inFigs. 102 and 103. Conclusions: Maintained high ICP and low PbtO2 are mortality determinants. Time with low PbtO2 increases the risk of death to a higher extent than time with high ICP. Low PbtO2 is in itself an independent prognostic factor. Even with moderate brain hypoxia, patients may reach an acceptable functional outcome.

Length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality are all increased 1 . National Healthcare Safety Network's (NHSN) data shows VAP rates in trauma patients are up to 3 fold higher compared to the general ICU population. Centralisation of UK trauma services has created larger cohorts of trauma patients in dedicated tertiary units 1 . Objective: We aimed to identify risk factors within the trauma population that put certain subgroups at higher risk of developing VAP. Method: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to the tertiary adult ICU of the Major Trauma Centre (MTC) at The Royal London Hospital over a 1-year period(February 2014-2015). The diagnosis of VAP was based on the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected. Mortality, LOS and duration of MV differences were studied between VAP and non-VAP groups. Results: Of the 1269 patients admitted to ICU, 925 required invasive ventilation for > 48 hours. Overall incidence of VAP was 11 % (104/ 925), with rates higher amongst the trauma population 19 % (61/ 315) compared to the general ICU population 7 % (43/610); p < 0.0001.

Introduction: Burnout appears to be common among Critical Care providers. It is characterized by three components: emotional exhaustion or loss of passion for one's work; depersonalization or treating patients as objects and the sense that your work is no longer meaningful. Moral distress is the inability of a moral agent to act according to his or her core values and perceived obligations due to internal and external constraints. Objectives: To assess both burnout syndrome and moral distress among all ICU and the Step Down Unit (SDU) providers (Physicians, Nurses, Nurse Technicians, and Respiratory Therapists) and to estimate the correlation between moral distress and burnout. Methods: For data collection, a self-administered questionnaire for each critical care provider was used including basic demographic data, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Moral Distress Scale (MDS). overall. The mean MDS rate for all ICU respondents including both domains (frequency and intensity) was 111.5 and for all SDU respondents was 104.5, p = 0.446. We observed that those respondents with high MDS score (>100 points) were more likely to suffer from Burnout (28.9 % x 14.4 %, p = 0.010). Moreover, many questions from the MDS questionnaire were significantly associated with severe burnout. Conclusions: Our data show that moral distress, resulting from therapeutic obstinacy and the provision of futile care was the great problem of the critical care providers' team and significantly associated with severe burnout. Conclusion: The QI presented are potentially useful nutritional markers and could implement ICU routine, the presence of a dietitian in the multidisciplinary team can facilitate that task.

The air-Q is a new supraglottic airway device used as a conduit for endotracheal intubation. This study compared the performance of air-Q with i-gel regarding airway seal pressures and ease of intubation for better function. Objectives: We hypothesized that the air-Q would have better airway sealing than the i-gel due to its larger cuff design and flexibility and compared it between patients undergoing positive pressure ventilation for general anesthesia. Methods: 50 patients classified as ASA 1 or 2 undergoing general anesthesia were randomly allocated into two groups, group A (Air-Q) or group I (i-gel). Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.5/kg. We compared the ease of intubation, vital signs, airway sealing pressures, and adverse events upon and during insertion. Acceptable peak inspiratory pressures were limited to 40 cmH2O, in which cases exceeded, endotracheal intubation was performed. Results: Airway leak pressures were lower in group A than group I. Hemodynamic and respiratory conditions were statistically insignificant between the two groups. Adverse events occurred in 1 patient from group A and 4 patients from group I in the post-anesthetic care unit. Introduction: Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by a promptly release of proinflammatory mediators that downregulate natural anticoagulant mechanisms, initiate the coagulation system, impair fibrinolysis and produce the rupture of the endothelial and epithelial monolayer (1) . Proinflammatory activated Alveolar Macrophages (AM) initiate and regulate ALI/ARDS inflammation and contribute to the propagation of the coagulant response. Currently there is no effective treatment for this disease. Previous studies have presented the beneficial effect of anticoagulants for their anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory action (2) (3) . Objectives: Evaluate the effect of local heparin administration in AM in ALI model. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats (~300 g) underwent intratracheal administration of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS 10 \u03bcg/g body weight) or Saline (0.9 %) in control animals. Saline or heparin (1000 IU/kg body weight) was nebulized through Aeroneb system (Philips Healthcare) at constant oxygen flow (2 L/min) before and after LPS administration. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after injury and AM from all groups were isolated with a bronchoalveolar lavage. The pro and anti-inflammatory pathways involved in AM activity were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Neutrophil and monocytic chemoattractant activity of AM was evaluated by CXCL1 and CCL2, respectively. Data expressed as media \u00b1 SEM, relative to GAPDH and fold over saline group (n = 8 for all the study groups). Statistics: One-Way-ANOVA and Newman Keuls post-hoc test (Statistical significance: p \u2264 0.05).Results: In ALI model there was a significant increase in TNF\u03b1, Arginase-1, Smad/TGF\u03b2 effectors and CCL2. Heparin reduced significantly TNF\u03b1, Arginase-1 and Smad 3. Further, changes were observed in iNOS, IL10, and Smad 2. Although no changes were detected on neutrophil chemoattractant activity of AM, monocytic chemotattractant activity was diminished by heparin (Fig. 83) . Conclusions: Altogether indicate that AM have a major role in the ALI development and resolution. During ALI, AM present more activity and the treatment with heparin is able to attenuate this response diminishing the lung injury. Introduction: Microparticles (MPs) are cell membrane-derived particles promoting coagulation, inflammation and cell-to-cell communication. MPs have been assessed as possible biomarkers of septic vascular dysfunction and sepsis-induced AKI [1] . However, the role of MPs in the crosstalk between coagulopathy and inflammation in septic patients is still unclear.

Objective: To evaluate its diagnostic accuracy, compared to other traditional biomarkers, such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, in a population presenting to emergency department (ED) with suspected sepsis. Methods: Study population: 223 patients (median age: 69 years [(Interquartile range (IQR: 31)]; 131 (58.7 %) male) with suspicion of sepsis, according to 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference criteria presenting at the ED were recruited. Definitive diagnosis was made according to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3). Laboratory methods: Blood samples were collected at first medical evaluation and analyzed for sepsis biomarkers. Presepsin concentrations were measured by a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay on an automated immunoassay analyser (PATHFAST). Statistical analysis: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each biomarker and optimal cutoff values were derived from ROC curves.

Elevated blood lactate concentrations are conventionally viewed as a surrogate of hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Despite its limitations hyperlactatemia is an independent predictor of mortality and thus it was included in the most recent septic shock definition. However, both the evolution and the time to normalization of lactate in representative cohorts of septic patients receiving vasopressors are largely unknown.Introduction: Multiple biomarkers have been studied to assess sepsis severity and prognosis. The pathological role of the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) has become increasingly evident in numerous types of diseases. A large number of papers have shown that circulating levels of AGEs are elevated under inflammatory and/or diabetic conditions, and associated with cardiovascular disease. Also, accumulation of AGEs in various tissues, progresses at a physiological normal aging, and at an extremely accelerated rate under hyperglicemic, inflammatory, and/or oxidative stress conditions. Objectives: Our aim was to study the dynamics of the plasma circulating levels of AGEs, and of the accumulated AGEs in the skin in septic patients during the first 5 days of the septic process, and their association with (i) APACHE II, (ii) SOFA on days 1 to 5, and (iii) mortality at day 28. Methods: We assessed 48 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU with the diagnosis of sepsis. We determined for 5 consecutive days plasma circulating AGEs and skin AGEs. Plasma AGEs were measured by quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of plasma according to the method of Munch et al. (1) in a multi-mode microplate reader (Synergy 2, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA), and results were expressed as arbitrary units (AU). Skin autofluorescence was measured with the AGE Reader mu (DiagnOptics, Groningen, The Netherlands) (2) . We correlated these results with the APACHE II, daily SOFA, and mortality at day 28. Results: There were 43 survivors and 5 non-survivors. We did not find association between plasma AGEs on days 1 to 5, and APACHE II or SOFA on days 1 to 5; neither between skin autofluorescence on days 1 to 5, and APACHE II or SOFA on days 1 to 5. When analyzing mortality at day 28, we found that on day 1, plasma AGEs in non-survivors were significantly higher (37,4 \u00b1 19,1) than in survivors (24,3 \u00b1 11,2) (p = 0.027); the receiver operating characteristic analysis (AUC = 0.742, p = 0.079), determined a trend but not power enough to predict 28-day mortality. On days 2 to 5, we did not find Introduction: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in children. The mortality remains unchanged, despite advances in treatment and the clinical judgement is still insufficient to an early recognition of outcomes in children with sepsis. Objective: To evaluate the patterns of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) ratio response to antibiotic therapy during the first 7 days in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in children admitted with sepsis. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective and descriptive cohort study of children (1 month to 18 years old) admitted at PICUs of 3 tertiary hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with sepsis diagnosis (less than 72 hours). CRP was sampled every other day during the first week of antibiotic therapy (from D0 to D6). CRP-ratio was calculated in relation to D0 CRP value. Patients were classified according to an individual pattern of CRP-ratio response with the following criteria: fast responsewhen D4 CRP was \u2264 0.4 of D0 CRP concentration; slow response -when D4 CRP was > 0.4 and D6 \u2264 0.8 of D0 CRP concentration (continuous and slow response); nonresponse -when D6 CRP was > 0.8 of D0 CRP concentration; biphasic response -characterized by an initial CRP decrease to levels < 0.8 of the D0 CRP followed by a secondary rise > 0.8. We performed comparison between PICU survivors and non-survivors. Results: This cohort included 99 patients (age median: 1.8; 52.5 % male); the most frequent sites of infection were lung (58.6 %), central nervous system (13.1 %), abdominal (7.1 %) and urinary (5.1 %). Out of the 99 patients, 88 could be classified according to a predefined pattern: 26.1 % fast response, 54.6 % slow response, 10.2 % nonresponse and 9.1 % biphasic response. The ICU mortality rate was significantly different (p < 0.001) according to the patterns of CRP-ratio response: fast response 4.3 %, slow response 2.1 %, nonresponse 44.4 % and biphasic response 37.5 %. Besides, the time dependent analysis of CRP-ratio and CRP course of the different patterns was significantly different (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In paediatric sepsis, sequential evaluation of CRP-ratio was useful in the early identification of patients with poor outcome. The identification of CRP-ratio pattern of response to antibiotics during the first week of antibiotic therapy could be useful in the recognition of the individual clinical evolution, influencing clinical decision-making process at bedside.Conclusions: These findings show that early and delayed brain injury are both independent predictors of worse outcome after SAH, and suggest that standard MRI protocols are useful diagnostic tools. Significant variance in outcome still remains, indicating that additional methods may be necessary to quantify brain damage after SAH. Introduction: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is responsible for 9-27 % of cerebrovascular diseases worldwide, with 37-52 % of mortality at 30 days and 54 % a year. Brain injury biomarkers (BIB) and inflammatory markers (IM) have been studied to predict prognosis in this disease. Objectives: To associated BIB and IM with mortality and functional outcome in patients with spontaneous ICH. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study, with patients admitted in ICU with spontaneous ICH. BIB were determined (Enolase, S-100B, Dimer D (DD), BNP, CRP) at admission, 1,2, 3 and 7 th day, and IM (transferrin, albumin, prealbumin, Quick index (QI), leukocytes) at admission and 7 th day. APACHE II, SOFA, GCS, GRAEB were determined at admission and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS: poor outcome >2) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS: poor outcome < 4) at ICU discharge. Variables were summarized using %, mean (SD) and median (minimal/ maximum). We used T-Student and \u03c72 (p < 0.05) for univariable analysis. We conducted a multivariable analysis for mortality with binary logistic regression (95 % CI, OR) p < 0,05. We obtained a ROC curve for those variables that were independent factors for mortality. Results: We enrolled 120 patients, 68 % were men, mean age 62 years(\u00b112.6). Global mortality was 34.2 %. 83.3 % were supratentorial and 16.7 % infratentorial. Mean APACHE II 14 (\u00b16, 5) and GCS 10.4 (\u00b14,1) and median SOFA 4 (0-14) and hematoma volume 21,35 cc3 (1-252). In the univariable analysis a worse outcome (with mRS and GOS) was significantly associated with APACHE II, SOFA, GCS at admission (p 0,000 each one), length of stay (LOS)-ICU and days of mechanical ventilation (p 0,000). The BIB and IM related with a worse mRS were DD at 1, 2 3 rd day (p 0,016, 0,002, 0,000 respectively), S-100B 1 st and 2 nd day (p 0,013 and 0,003) and CRP 1, 2 and 3 rd day (p 0,039, 0,001, 0,002); and with a worse GOS were DD 2 and 3 rd day (p 0,015 and 0,002), S-100B and CRP at 2 nd day (p 0,04 and 0,009). Otherwise, mortality was associated with BNP at admission, 1, 2, 3 and 7 th day (p 0.005, 0.006, 0.022, 0.032 and 0.010), DD 1, 2, 3 and 7 th day (p 0.037, 0.001, 0.000 and 0.001), CRP 2 nd day (p 0.004), QI at admission (p 0.004), albumin at admission and 7 th day (p 0.013 and 0.037), prealbumin at admission and 7 th day (p 0.007 and 0.014). After the multivariable analysis obtained the QI at admission as an independent factor with mortality OR 0.978 (95 % CI 0.962 to 0.994; p 0.009). We performed a ROC curve for QI with AUC 0.668 (p 0.003) an a cutoff point 80.50 %. Conclusions: BIB as S-100B and DD (1, 2 and 3rd day) and CRP (first 72 hours) in an early stage were related to worse outcome at ICU discharge. QI at admission with cutoff point 80.50 % was associated with lower risk of mortality. Introduction: Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of erythrocytes and it is used for the differential diagnosis of anaemia. High RDW has been associated with increased hospital mortality in some patients, but this has not been studied in subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Objectives: To investigate whether RDW is associated with outcome after SAH. Methods: We reviewed our institutional database of all adult patients with non-traumatic SAH (2013-2015). We collected demographics, SAH-related data and results of routine daily blood analyses. The RDW (normal values: 10.9-13.4 %), was obtained from the day of admission to day 3. We recorded ICU mortality and long-term neurological outcome; a Glasgow Outcome scale of 4-5 at 3-months was used to define a good neurological outcome (GNO).As the United Kingdom intensive care training curriculum develops and the role of the intensive care physician becomes more defined so procedural skills associated with this role will become refined. Some skills such as intubation and central access are well recognised. However, occasionally less common skills may be required and these deserve a place in the curriculum. One such skill is that of Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (SBT) insertion. Currently the curriculum contains domain 5.18: 'Describes Sengstaken tube (or equivalent) placement'. A trainee survey was undertaken to quantify the degree of familiarity with this clinical tool in the Severn deanery in the South West of the UK. A mixed cohort of 24 trainees responded (17 intensive care, 7 anaesthetic trainees). Of those surveyed 3 had inserted SBT, 21 had not. 61 % had some previous experience with SBT ('seen one inserted by someone' or 'looked after a patient with an SBT in situ'). Little formal teaching existed on the topic with 57 % having received no training. 75 % felt they would benefit from a formal teaching session. This survey demonstrated a gap in confidence and exposure to SBT use. As a result, a short teaching intervention was performed during a regional training day. This focused on the common cause of GI bleeds and situations where SBT may be of benefit, as well as practical aspects of insertion, along a low fidelity model demonstration. After this session a repeat questionnaire was sent out. This demonstrated that confidence was improved (Fig. 104) , with 61 % feeling that annual training would be of benefit. Summary: As the Intensive Care curriculum continues to develops, trainees feel they would benefit from regular training sessions in less common skills such as the management of Sengstaken-Blakemore tubes. More broadly, involving trainees in the development of the curriculum will ensure it meets the learning needs of the future work force and guarantee high quality patient care. Introduction: The most common sources of clinical errors are not from failure of clinical knowledge or skill, but rather failure of team performance with deficiencies in communication, coordination and teamwork. Growing evidence suggests that team training based on crew resource management (CRM) principles may improve teamwork, patient safety, and optimization of patient care. Objectives: We evaluated the impact of simulation based team training on acute ICU admissions and determined this improved the confidence of the ICU staff and the quality of teamwork. Methods: The project comprised 2 parts. In the first part, all participants received a 2-hour theoretical video training covering the basics of CRM prior the beginning of the study. Subsequently, during a Objectives: The study aimed to see the role of glycerol and LP ratio monitoring in the brain parenchyma region and its association with cerebral perfusion pressure for outcome prediction. Methods: The study was conducted on 41 patients above 18 years of age with severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < =8) who presented to the emergency with a surgically treatable lesion. Patients who were pregnant, GCS =3 with fixed dilated pupils or hemodynamically unstable were not enrolled in this prospective non-randomised study. As part of routine protocol, patient underwent a non contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head at admission along with assessment of other systemic injuries. Informed consent and Institute ethics review board permission was obtained prior to inclusion in this study. The outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). Results: A total of 3,697 corresponding cerebral perfusion pressure and brain microdialysis readings were obtained. In our study, the mean CPP for the whole cohort was 74.27 mm Hg (SD 14.05). Glycerol: When compared during the first two days of monitoring, the glycerol levels were higher in the unfavourable outcome group (Mean 220.86; SD 25.85) as compared to the favourable outcome group (Mean 191.76; SD 31.89) [NS] . LP ratio: In the poor outcome group, 1354 values were available for LP ratio with a mean of 80.16 (SD 320.26). In the good outcome group, 2047 values were obtained with a mean LP ratio of 45.77 (SD 169.82). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Cerebral perfusion pressure was seen to have an inverse correlation to LP ratio for the whole cohort as would be expected with increased perfusion (p = 0.029). Conclusions: CPP monitoring is important after traumatic brain injury since cerebral blood flow is highly dependent on CPP below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation (CPP < 50 mmHg). Higher CPP by its effect on metabolic parameters, such as LP ratio could be associated with a better outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 213, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1928, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2155, "end": 2158, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 13293, "end": 13297, "text": "[NS]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 10805, "end": 10815, "text": "(Fig. 104)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A700"}, {"text": "The use of outcome prediction models in severe traumatic brain injury S. Honeybul Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Neurosurgery, Perth, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):A746 Introduction: Predicting long-term neurological outcomes after severe traumatic brain (TBI) is important, but which prognostic model in the context of decompressive craniectomy has the best performance remains uncertain. Methods: This prospective observational cohort study included all patients who had severe TBI requiring decompressive craniectomy between 2004 and 2014, in the two neurosurgical centres in Perth, Western Australia. Severe disability, vegetative state, or death were defined as unfavourable neurological outcomes. Area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) and slope and intercept of the calibration curve were used to assess discrimination and calibration of the CRASH (Corticosteroid-Randomization-After-Significant-Head injury) and IMPACT (International-Mission-For-Prognosis-And-Clinical-Trial) models, respectively. Results: Of the 319 patients included in the study, 118 (37 %) had unfavourable neurological outcomes at 18-month after decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI. Both CRASH (AUROC 0.86, 95 % confidence interval 0.81-0.90) and IMPACT full-model (AUROC 0.85, 95%CI 0.80-0.89) were similar in discriminating between favourable and unfavourable neurological outcome at 18-month after surgery (p = 0.690 for the difference in AUROC derived from the two models). Although both models tended to over-predict the risks of long-term unfavourable outcome, the IMPACT model had a slightly better calibration than the CRASH model (intercept of the calibration curve = \u22124.1 vs. -5.7, respectively), especially when the predicted risks of unfavourable outcome were < 80 %. Conclusions: Both CRASH and IMPACT prognostic models were good in discriminating between favourable and unfavourable long-term neurological outcome for patients with severe TBI requiring decompressive craniectomy, but the calibration of the IMPACT full-model was better than the CRASH model. Introduction: Early rehabilitation is one of the most important therapy issue in the Intensive care unit (ICU). One of the most essential part of early rehabilitation is passive verticalization provided by medical tilt table. However there is no information provided about verticatization in polyvalent intensive care unit. Objective: To investigate was the passive verticalization (PV) possibility and safety in the polyvalent ICU. Material and methods: We analyzed 38 episodes of PV in 14 patients of polyvalent ICU: polytrauma (n = 8), isolated, traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 8). Verticatization was provided by the medical tilt table. In 24 (63, 2 %) cases we verticalizated patients on artificial lung ventilation (ALV), in 14 (36,8 %) cases on spontaneous breathing. Verticatization was provided up to 20\u00b0during first session, up to 40\u00b0during the second and up to 50\u00b0-60\u00b0during the third session. Verticatization session was cared out gradually with the step of 10\u00b0in 5 minutes. As the angle of inclination was reached, patient was fixed in a final position during 15 minutes. If any signs of orthostatic failure occurred the patient was still fixed on the reached point till compensation, but not more than for 15 minutes. The session was continued only after orthostatic failure absolute regress. If no regress happed during 15 minutes the sessions was stopped. Results: Patients on ALV successfully reached the target value during 22 (91, 7 %) sessions. Most of the sessions (19(86, 4 %)) were performed without complications; in 3 cases (13, 6 %) were noted some insignificant complications. Two of the sessions (8, 3 %) had to be stopped because of the orthostatic failure. Patients on spontaneous breathing reached a target angle in 12 (85.7 %) session with no complications. Two of the sessions (14, 3 %) were interrupted because of the complications. The most frequent of the verticalization are tachycardia (n = 4 (10, 5 %)), arterial hypotension (n = 5 (13, 2 %)), tachypnea (n = 6 (15, 8 %)). Conclusions: In the polyvalent intensive care unit verticalization can be used safety in patients on ALV and on spontaneous breathing. Introduction: Hemorrhagic shock (HS) accounts for about 40 % of trauma-related deaths [1] . The severity of trauma can be further deteriorated by an additional blunt chest trauma (TxT), which independently contributes to mortality upon the development of acute lung injury (ALI) [2] . The development of ALI following a severe trauma is encouraged by both active and passive cigarette smoke (CS) exposure [3] . We previously showed that CS exposure prior to TxT enhanced post-traumatic inflammation thereby aggravating lung injury [4] . Objectives: We investigated the impact of pre-traumatic CS exposure in mice following HS alone or in combination with TxT. Methods: After 3-4 weeks of CS-exposure, anesthetized and spontaneously breathing (C57BL/6) mice underwent TxT or sham surgery. After initiation of lung-protective mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy and instrumentation for vascular access, mice underwent 1 h of hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 35 mmHg) followed by resuscitation comprising re-transfusion of shed blood, fluid administration and noradrenaline (NA) titrated to maintain MAP > 50 mmHg. Lung mechanics, gas exchange, hemodynamics, metabolism, and acid-base status were measured together with lung and plasma cytokine and chemokine levels. After 4 h, lung and kidney were harvested for immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Results: Pulmonary compliance was increased in chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) mice which had only received HS. Lung tissue levels of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were slightly elevated in nonCOPD mice which, due to more NO availability, is in line with increased NA requirements to maintain hemodynamic targets. Also, systemic and pulmonary cytokine and chemokine levels as well as lung tissue expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were increased in COPD mice. Their mortality rates were similar, whereas in the combined trauma model COPD mice showed an increase in mortality and elevated NA requirements compared to nonCOPD mice. Lung tissue HO-1 expression was reduced in the combined trauma model. Conclusion: CS exposure aggravated post-traumatic inflammation. CS exposure prior to TxT and subsequent HS was associated with increased mortality rates. As HO-1 has been reported to act protective in ALI [5] , we presume its reduction strongly highlights the severity of trauma due to an exhausted ALIassociated anti-inflammatory defence system. Introduction: Differential expression of specific genes has been associated with postoperative brain injury and individual variation in the severity of the host response following cardiac surgery 1,2 . We investigated the role of DNA sequence variation in modulating the observed changes in gene expression. Objectives: Our aim was to reveal the most relevant regulatory genetic variants of the host response to elective cardiac surgery and the clinical relevance of the variants detected. To identify these regulatory variants we performed an Expression Quantitative Analysis (e-QTL). Methods: The Ambion LeukoLOCK Total RNA Isolation System was used to purify leukocytes from whole blood isolated before induction of anaesthesia and 24 hours after surgery. Gene expression was quantified using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 expression beadchip . The output of this analysis was filtered by fold expression and P-values were corrected to false discovery rate < 0.05. Genotyping was performed on OmniExpressed-12v1chip. e-QTLS analysis was peformed using Matrix e-QTL software. Pathways analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (web based software). Results: 46 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) were recruited. Postoperative recovery was uneventful with only minor complications. Of the genes differentially regulated 24 hours after cardiac surgery 80 were up-regulated and 15 were down -regulated. The group of up-regulated genes are primarily related to the innate immune response and cell signalling. Of the 15 downregulated the majority are implicated in T lymphocyte activation. We identified 659 single nucleotide polymorphisms (10.E-06) that are significantly associated with the cis regulation of 218 genes, 24 hours after cardiac surgery. Analysis of the 10 top enriched pathways showed three groups 1-Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) group. 2-Interferon and growth factors group 3-Leptin Pathway group . (4) Introduction: Given that surgical procedures have become minimally invasive, we thought that postoperative energy expenditure would be decreased. In fact, the resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by an indirect calorimeter after minimally invasive esophagectomy in the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly lower than the basal energy expenditure (BEE) estimated using the Harris-Benedict equation (HBE) [1] . However, postoperative REE after cardiovascular surgery remains unclear.Objectives: We hypothesized that the postoperative REE would be lower than the BEE in patients in the ICU who had undergone cardiovascular surgery and conducted a prospective observational study to investigate it. Methods: The ethics committee from our hospital approved this prospective study. This study included patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery in our hospital from September 2013 to March 2015. After surgery, the REE was measured using an Engstr\u00f6m device (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan), which consists of a ventilator and an indirect calorimeter, and was measured from the time from ICU admission to extubation or at 9 AM on postoperative day 1. The patients received pressure-controlled ventilation (tidal volume: 6-10 mL/kg) in the ICU under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation. The ventilation setting and the doses of these sedative agents were adjusted by each physician in accordance with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). Patients received an infusion of a 10 % glucose solution at a rate of 192 kcal/day after admission into the ICU. We maintained the blood glucose level between 110 to 180 mg/dL using an artificial pancreas (STG-55, Nikkiso, Tokyo, Japan). The following data were obtained: age, body weight, height, RASS, and REE for each hour during ventilation. The REE and the BEE estimated using the HBE were compared using the paired t-test. Results: Forty-seven patients (23 female and 24 male) were enrolled in this study. The mean age, body weight, and height were 73 \u00b1 10 years (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), 55 \u00b1 10 kg, and 155 \u00b1 10 cm, respectively. Seventy three percent of patients received a cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP). The average temperature and RASS during ventilation were 38.2 \u00b1 3.3\u00b0C and \u22123 \u00b1 1, respectively. The average REE during ventilation was 1314 \u00b1 148 kcal/day (23.9 \u00b1 6.8 kcal/kg/day). The average BEE was 1147 \u00b1 148 kcal/day. The average REE during ventilation was significantly higher than the BEE (114 \u00b1 35 % of the BEE, p = 0.02). In addition, the REE was not significantly different between patients who received a CBP and patients who did not receive a CBP.Conclusions: The REE after cardiovascular surgery was significantly higher than the BEE regardless of whether a CBP was performed. In postoperative patients, it is important to note the difference in surgical procedures when estimating the optimal target calorie level for nutrition therapy. Introduction: Critically ill patients with body mass index (BMI) lower than 20 kg/m 2 have worse outcomes than normal or overweight patients possibly because underweight is a marker of malnutrition. It has been suggested that in malnourished critically ill patients an early increased intake of calories and protein might improve their prognosis. Introduction: Nutritional risk and malnutrition must be screened at admission in intensive care units (ICU) because these patients usually benefit from early nutritional therapy 1 . Nutritional parameters should be monitored by quality indicators (QI), but their goals and association with patient outcome are still unknown. Objectives: To estimate the impact of malnutrition, nutritional risk and high caloric deficit on mortality at a 60 days follow-up in a general ICU population. Methods: Consecutive adult patients who remained in the ICU for greater then 48 hours were included and prospectively followed. Data were abstracted from electronic health records (EHR) by trained ICU dietitians on their sex, age, APACHE II and baseline nutrition assessment at admission 2 . Daily nutrition information was collected on the type (i.e. EN, PN, oral, none) and amount of nutrition received (total calories) from ICU admission for a maximum of the first 7 days (EN only) unless death or discharge occurred sooner. Heavy caloric deficit occurred when < 25 % of the caloric needs was achieved in the first ICU week. Patients were followed while in hospital and their outcomes determined at 60 days after ICU admission. Online forms were elaborated to enter abstracted data with a secure web-based tool (GoogleDocs, \u00a9 2012).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 4350, "end": 4353, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4543, "end": 4546, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4669, "end": 4672, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4795, "end": 4798, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6560, "end": 6563, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 9123, "end": 9126, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "A746"}, {"text": "A total of 236 EHR were verify from 2014 to 2015 in 4 this audit, 85.6 % were screened for Nutritional risk of that 91.1 % had nutritional risk according to NRS 2002 tool 2 , 85.2 % were accessed with ASPEN-ADA 3 tool, diagnosing 23.4 % of malnutrition. 91.1 % of the EHR had information on the nutrients received, heavy caloric deficit was verif in 27.4 % of the EHR with this information. Binary logistic regression evidenced risk of mortality at 60 days 8.01 times higher (95%CI 1.86 -34.7, Wald = 7.8, p = 0.005) in patients malnourished and with heavy caloric deficit in the first ICU week at the same time when compared with patients without these two risk factors (controlled by sex, age and APACHE II). Either malnutrition or heavy caloric deficit when present increases the mortality risk in 5.83 times (95%CI 1,33 -25.4, Wald = 5.5, p = 0.019). Nutritional risk was not related with mortality at 60 days. Introduction: In metabolic ICU research it is often desirable to measure local blood flow to quantify production/utilization of various substrates. The gold standard is to do this through dilution techniques of e.g. cold water or dye. These methods are however invasive and may cause pain or risk of injury of the patient. It is therefore desirable to use noninvasive techniques, such as Strain Gauge Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (SGVOP) and Doppler Ultra Sound (DUS). Both of these are used today but they measure blood flow through different principles and gives results in different units. These methods have previously been compared in healthy subjects but never in ICU Patients. Objectives: We wanted to investigate the correlation between SGVOP and DUS and how they are able to detect changes in blood flow in ICU patients. Methods: ICU patients (n = 10) with an expected stay of >24 hours were recruited after informed consent. All patients underwent simultaneous blood flow measurements of both legs at two separate time points (5-26 hours) and medical data was collected from charts. SGVOP was performed on the left side with the cuff placed on the medial thigh and a strain gauge placed on the thickest part of the calf, which was hanging free as the foot was supported by pillows. Blood flow was estimated as a mean of five measurements. DUS was performed on the right leg by measuring the diameter of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) thrice and assess blood flow was at angle >60 0 as a mean of five heart strokes. A mean of three such measurements was calculated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results"}, {"text": "The mean values at the two time points were 36.3 \u00b1 27.4 and 28.6 \u00b1 21.0 ml x min \u22121 x 100 ml tissue \u22121 (with 10 % variability) for SGVOP and for DUS 189 \u00b1 126 and 128 \u00b1 60 ml/min (7.7 % variability). The r value for comparison between the methods in all measurements was 0.684 (p < 0.001) and for the change in blood flow between the time points 0.423 (p = 0.223). However 3 patients had higher doses of noradrenaline (>0.075 \u03bcg/kg/min) and changes in noradrenaline between the time points. When these were excluded from the analysis, the r value for the remaining 7 patients were 0.710 (p = 0.004) for all measurements and 0.913 (p = 0.004) to assess the change between time points. Conclusions: SGVOP measures blood flow in the lower leg and does not correlate exactly with DUS of SFA. The methods however correlate fairly good and approximates changes in blood flow very good in stable hemodynamic conditions, similarly as in previous studies in healthy subjects, but fails to do so in situations with higher doses and changes in noradrenaline. This might be because noradrenaline alters the portion of blood going to skin and muscle respectively. is increasingly used as a surrogate endpoint in intensive care Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). Serially measured SOFA is independently associated with mortality in observational cohorts [1] , but the association between RCT treatment effects on SOFA vs. mortality has not yet been quantified. It is currently unclear which SOFA abstraction is the most responsive and consistent surrogate endpoint for mortality in RCTs. Objectives: Using study-level data from published RCTs that report both SOFA and mortality, our objective was to quantify the relation between SOFA endpoints and mortality and to identify which SOFA abstraction best reflects between-group mortality differences. Methods: RCTs in adult intensive care patients reporting both SOFA and mortality endpoints were identified using a PubMed and Embase query. Reported SOFA abstractions were classified as early, late and delta according to the definition used to compute the SOFA endpoint (Table 87) . Treatment effects on SOFA were calculated as the between-group SOFA standardized difference. Treatment effects on mortality were calculated as log odds ratio (OR) of treatment vs. control group mortality. We used random-effects meta-regression to: (i) quantify the linear relationship between RCT treatment effects on mortality (logOR) and SOFA; (ii) quantify residual heterogeneity (expressed as I 2 and tau). The review protocol was prospectively registered (CRD42016034014). Results: Data from 87 studies were included in the analysis (Fig. 115) . Fifty-five studies used Early-SOFA, 32 studies used Late-SOFA and 25 studies used Delta-SOFA as an endpoint. Studies reporting different SOFA abstractions had comparable characteristics regarding sample size, year of publication and study population.Between-group differences in Early-SOFA and Late-SOFA were not significantly associated with between-group differences in mortality (slope = 0.40 (SE 0.21), p = 0.116 and Slope = 0.18 (SE 0.25), p = 0.457, respectively), but difference in Delta-SOFA was (slope = 0.70 (SE 0.22), p = 0.005) (Fig. 116) . The heterogeneity of the association was lowest for Delta-SOFA (I 2 = 0 % vs. 14 % and 13 %, p < 0.01 against both using F-test on tau 2 ). Conclusions: Time-fixed Early-and Late-SOFA were the most frequently reported outcome measures among the reviewed RCTs.

In these settings, intensive care medicine is challenged by delicate resource restrictions which are likely to affect patient outcome (2) . Objective: To evaluate the epidemiology and outcome of critical illness in Mongolia, a lower-middle income country in Central Asia. Methods: In this prospective observational study, demographic, clinical and outcome data of all critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) of five tertiary university teaching hospitals Introduction: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is harmful and a major problem worldwide that is associated with ill health and mortality (1,2). Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) on outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) after scoliosis surgery.Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in 103 patients, 12-18 years, with idiopathic scoliosis for elective posterior spinal fusion. All patients underwent standard total intravenous anesthesia and epidural morphine with PCA. Quality of pain relief and sedation were assessed using the Numeric Visual Analog Scale (NVAS), Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). The patients were divided into three groups: Group S; consisted of smokers, Group SHS; consisted of exposure smokers, and Group NS; consisted of individuals who did not have any history of smoking and were not exposed to smoke. Information was reported in questionnaires and took blood samples for analysis of serum cotinine obtained at the time of study enrollment. Demographic and clinical characteristics included morphine usage, blood transfusion, duration of mechanical ventilator support and length of ICU stay were recorded. Results: The patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. There was a statistically significant difference among groups in terms of serum cotinine levels. There were no significant differences in NVAS and RASS scores between the groups. The HR and MAP were not differ between the three groups of patients at all the evaluation time. Morphine consumption was significantly less in Group SHS compared with that of Group S at all time points (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences regarding the number of transfused blood units between the three groups of patients.

A. Taha Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 20 -50 % in patients with severe sepsis, with more than half of these patients needing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) 1 . The mortality among the patients needing CRRT generally exceeds 60 % 2,3 .Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with a diagnosis of severe sepsis with AKI and who required CRRT. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Changi General Hospital MICU with a diagnosis of severe sepsis with AKI who required CRRT from June 2013 to January 2015.Results: A total of 213 patients were screened and 33 were excluded because of incomplete data. One hundred and eighty patient records were analyzed. Of these, 105 (58.3 %) were male. The mean APACHE II score was 28.13 \u00b1 9.64. The median length of MICU stay was 3 days (interquartile range 1-7) and median hospital length of stay was 16 days (interquartile range 9-33). The median duration of dialysis was 1 day (interquartile range 1-2). The MICU mortality was 38.9 % and hospital mortality was 39.4 %. Conclusions: Mortality rates in our study were lower than what is previously stated in the literature. It may be worthwhile to conduct a multicentre study which includes other institutions in Singapore.Introduction: Mortality in critically ill patients is high either while in the ICU but also after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The mortality rate must be understood and integrated into the hospital reality where the ICU is inserted.Objectives: In the present study we aim to understand factors associated with ICU and hospital mortality and the trajectories and burden of functional limitations of ICU survivors. Of the patients who died from septic shock, 36 were medical and 35 urgent surgical. Septic shock was the main cause of death in medical and, in particular, in urgent surgical population. Medical patients had a early ICU mortality (<48 h) that was higher than in surgical patients. Higher age and higher severity of disease was also associated with higher mortality. Mortality was significantly higher in those patients who had a longer lenght of stay in hospital before ICU admission (Table 88) . Those who died after ICU had a median lenght of stay in hospital of 49 days; of these, a median of 8 days were spent in the ICU, a median of 13 days were spent in the ward before ICU admission and a median of 28 days were spent after ICU discharge until death occurs in the ward.Conclusions: The perception of the conditions under which death occurs can help to rethink the organization of the critical patient circuit in the hospital, in particular to prompt earlier ICU admissions and to adress more aproppriately those patients who might or not benefit from ICU admission.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 128, "end": 132, "text": "Taha", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2360, "end": 2370, "text": "(Table 88)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A788"}]}
