In this study, we aim to investigate how interferons differentially stimulate the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) family proteins and further be involved in the process of heart development. The expression levels of three IFITM family members, IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were investigated during Sprague-Dawley rat myocardial development and differentiation of H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The effects of interferon-a, -b, and -g on DNA synthesis in H9C2 cells were also characterized. Up-regulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 were observed during the heart development of Sprague-Dawley rat and the differentiation of H9C2 cells. Moreover, interferon-a and -b induce the expression of IFITM3 while interferon-g up-regulates IFITM1. Finally, interferon-a and -b were demonstrated to inhibit DNA synthesis during H9C2 cell differentiation. Our results indicated interferons are potentially involved in the differentiation and cell proliferation during heart development.",

There are two basic types of interferons: type I interferons (a and b predominately) are encoded by a large family of genes and secreted principally by leukocytes (a) and fibroblasts (b) and are induced directly in response to a viral infection; type II interferons (g), which are structurally unrelated and encoded by a single gene, are synthesized by T lymphocytes or natural killer cells following detection of infected cells by antigen presentation. Type I and type II interferons signal through distinct but related pathways [Stark et al., 1998] . They bind to their cognate receptors, which bind to the Janus kinases (JAKs) and the signal transducers and activators of transcriptions (STATs) [McGillicuddy et al., 2009; Dedoni et al., 2010] . These in turn initiate a signaling cascade that eventually leads to the transcriptional induction of genes whose products mediate interferon actions such as inhibition of proliferation.",

Nonetheless, there is a growing body of evidence that interferon-g plays a critical role in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro. Recent studies also found that interferon-b stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [Schirmer et al., 2010] while interferon-g is required for efficient skeletal muscle regeneration [Cheng et al., 2008] .

Later, Anisimov and his group isolated a number of expressed sequence tags clones that were differentially expressed during differentiation of P19 embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes by serial analysis of gene expression [Anisimov et al., 2002] . One of the up-regulated genes identified by this study was the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, which was first identified to encode a T-cell surface antigen Leu-13 and predominately expressed in heart tissues [Anisimov et al., 2002] . Together with the other two family members, IFITM2 and IFITM3, they correlate to inhibition of cell growth in cancer cells and immune cells and play a role in development in mice [Bradbury et al., 1993; Deblandre et al., 1995] .

In agreement with the timing of the rapid switch, our results demonstrated a continuous increase in the expression of IFITM1 from postnatal 7 days and IFITM2 and IFITM3 from postnatal 14 days in rat ventricles.

Expression of IFITM3 was notably increased by type I interferons, but did not change significantly when exposed to type II interferon. IFITM2 was non-responsive to both type I and type II interferons.

Such different expression patterns of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in response to interferons in various cell types may be a consequence of cell type specificity to perform specialized physiological functions. However, another possibility of the variations of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activating sequences in the promoter regions in different species cannot be excluded.

            "text": "Interferons are cytokines that regulate a variety of biological effects and one of the profound properties of interferons is inhibition of proliferation. The interferon-induced growth inhibition affects different phases of the mitotic cycle, including a block in G1, lengthening of the S phase or a general prolongation of the cell cycle [Sangfelt et al., 1999; Murphy et al., 2001; Vannucchi et al., 2005] . It is not clear which genes are involved in cell cycle control induced by interferons although several studies link the IFITM family to antiproliferative activity. However, the findings are quite controversial. Higher IFITM1 expression has been correlated with improved survival in chronic myeloid leukemia patients [Akyerli et al., 2005] . Downregulation of IFITM1 and IFITM3 also correlates with brain tumor progression [Huang et al., 2000] . Notably, overexpression of IFITM1 negatively regulated cell growth, whereas suppression of IFITM1 blocked the antiproliferative effect of interferon-g [Yang et al., 2007] . On the contrary, a recent study showed that IFITM gene expression was significantly up-regulated specifically in colorectal tumors and IFITM family proteins may serve as a molecular marker in those tumors [Andreu et al., 2006] . Consistently, the knockdown of IFITM1 inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells . Moreover, IFITM1 is able to promote invasion at early stage of head and neck cancer progression [Hatano et al., 2008] . We speculate that the proliferative and antiproliferative effects of IFITM proteins are quite cell type-specific, depending on the differences in interacting partners in different scenarios.",

The reaction mixture was denatured at 658C for 5 min and then on ice for 1 min. Then cDNA synthesis reaction mix, containing 5\u00c2 synthesis buffer, 0.1 M DTT, 4 U Reverse transcriptase (RT), 4 U RNaseOUT was added to RNA and cDNA synthesis reaction was proceeded for 1 h at 558C and an heat-inactivation step at 708C for 15 min. Then the first-strand cDNA was stored at \u00c0208C until use.",

Cycling reaction conditions consisted of the following: 508C for 2 min, 958C for 10 min, followed by 958C for 15 s and 608C for 1 min cycled 40 times. Reactions were performed in 96-well MicroAmp Optical plates (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 ml. Each reaction mix included 1 or 2 ml cDNA templates, 0.625 mM forward and reverse primers and 1X Power SYBR Green Reaction Mix (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate-dehydrogenase or b-actin was used to normalize the cDNA templates in each panel. Non-template controls were included in each plate. All data were analyzed by the SDS 1.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems).",

The cells were first washed with PBS containing 10% FBS for three times and fixed by chilled fixative solution at \u00c0208C for 30 min. After that, the cells were washed with PBS containing 10% FBS for three times, then digested by nuclease solution at 378C for 30 min and subjected to washing for three times again. After that, the cells were incubated in anti-BrdU-POD at 378C for 30 min and washed three times with 1\u00c2 washing solution to remove excess antibody, followed by incubation in peroxidase substrates in a dark area at room temperature for 5-30 min. The samples were then transferred from the 12-well plate to a 96-well plate and triplicate aliquots from each sample were applied. Extinction of the samples was measured in a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm with a reference wavelength at 490 nm. Background BrdU incorporation was subtracted from the samples. Cellular DNA synthesis was measured by the BrdU incorporation divided by the respective cell number.",
