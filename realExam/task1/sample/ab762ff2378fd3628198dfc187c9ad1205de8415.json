We theorize that the diffusion of particular content on Twitter can be driven by a sequence of nouns, adjectives, adverbs forming a sentence. We exhibit that the proposed approach is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of tweets to a common choice of words while constructing a sentence to express an opinion or sentiment. Through this paper, we propose a Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) to study the degree of diffusion of content (retweet on Twitter). Our framework first extracts the words, create a matrix of these words using the sequences in the tweet text. To this sequence matrix we further multiply custom weights basis the presence index in a sentence wherein higher weights are given if the impactful class of tokens/words like nouns, adjectives are used at the beginning of the sentence than at last. We then try to predict the possibility of diffusion of information using Long-Short Term Memory Deep Neural Network architecture, which in turn is further optimized on the accuracy and training execution time by a Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The results of the proposed CWWE are compared to a pre-trained glove word embedding. For experimentation, we created a corpus of size 230,000 tweets posted by more than 45,000 users in 6 months. Research experimentations reveal that using the proposed framework of Custom Weighted Word Embedding (CWWE) from the tweet there is a significant improvement in the overall accuracy of Deep Learning framework model in predicting information diffusion through tweets.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Microblogging website Twitter has emerged as one of the primary online social media platforms across the globe for sharing opinions, interests, and points of view on events and issues varying from education, sports, online content to politics. Users on Twitter can associate their share of opinions related to a subject matter by writing a simple tweet and posting it in real-time. The selection of right expletives and positioning the same in a tweet sentence plays a critical role in attracting the attention of right receivers (users of Twitter) of this tweet with similar interests inside the Twitter platform. Sharples [1] has claimed that readers on any platform of communication should treat writing as a creative act of writers using which they deliberately select phrases and position them to impose a certain interpretation through lexical and linguistic preferences. This hypothesis was first developed by Maun [2] , showing how diverse set of writers from various backgrounds, are extremely cognizant of articulated aspects of writing, positioning the expletives with opinions that we should hypothesize as writing practice and as an act of thoughts representation. The idea of sentence writing includes the design of the factual or non-factual information of a topic, person, event or domain, followed by opinion generation through experience or knowledge expressed in words, within a framework requiring the expertise of linguistics as well as the nature of genres and domains in which the communication is taking place. The sentence then reaches the receiver (also referred to diffusion in modern world) to whom the original writer/sender was planning to convey the message to. The receiver in turn again uses the knowledge of linguistics to interpret the meaning which original sender was trying to convey. Hence linguistic competence is central to understand the degree of diffusion of information in any communication channel.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 627, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 922, "end": 925, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Social media application Twitter bring users with similar opinion across the globe on the same platform to communicated, cascade the information to a wider set of users beyond their group referred to as information diffusion (also referred to as retweet on Twitter) in a real-time basis.

Prior research appears a little apprehensive about the accurate enriching relationship between the selection of words, placing in a certain order, and about how the thoughts get reconstructed when we alter the sequence of words. The area of linguistics has welldescribed literature on how a well-formed sentence structure can guide the communication of inference and opinion expressed and at the same time increase the penetration of the sentence at the user level. Aligning the sentences for an appropriate theme and rheme and the idea of linearization of the words in which 'what an author places first will drive the interpretation and penetration of rest that has to follow' [3] are known ideas to linguist researchers. Also is the goal of concluding remarks in a sentence [4] : because the initial vocable or noun in a phrase gains more importance, and professional writers will change the order of the words to engage the reader's attention to the factual information using the active mode of writing a sentence. These are design alternatives which the writer of a sentence or a tweet on Twitter has to learn and there are options within this learning that require attention, be it direct or indirect, that a verbally spoken sentence is not the same as a written one.

However, as such, any literature or verbatim synopsis is already abstractive in nature and has very little possibility of reproduction of the original sentence. With all deep learning architectures getting noticed by researchers in the field of unstructured data, it has become a more practical option for any NLP analysis, researchers have begun to consider these frameworks as a fully data-driven alternative to abstractive text summarization. The possibility of storing the meaning of a sentence with abstract features extracted is not completely explored. In the latest research, Lopyrev [27] relates an application of an encoder-decoder RNN (recurrent neural network) with LSTM units and notices that the framework starts creating headlines from the actual text of news articles. In a slightly different but related work, Rush [28] presented a fully data-driven framework for sentence summarization. His approach makes use of an attention driven algorithm that creates each word from the input sentence as summary transformed. Chopra [29] proposes a constraint-based RNN (recurrent neural network) which can easily create an abstract of any input phrase. The transformation has been done by a unique approach in which a convolutional encoder is implemented to make sure that the corresponding decoder centers around the proper input words at each phase of generation.

With this motivation we chose the semantics which represents the micro level information of a tweet and developed a framework of embedding matrix representing a writer's habit of placing the part of speech (Nouns and adjectives). We further used the rules of semantic information with the help of deep neural network framework to predict if a tweet will be retweeted on not. We proved that the diffusion of a particular content on Twitter can be driven by a sequence of nouns, adjectives, adverbs forming a sentence. We exhibited that the proposed approach in this paper is coherent with the intrinsic disposition of tweets to a common choice of words while constructing a sentence to express an opinion or sentiment. With this experimentation we have established that if a writer uses an adjective or a noun at the beginning of the sentence, there is highly likely a chance that the sentence/text/information is going to diffuse at a faster rate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "Motivated by the positive results of the current experiment, as next steps for future research work, we plan to extend the CWWE along with the other features like size of the network structure, the user is part of and understand the relation with social influence on social media platform Twitter.
