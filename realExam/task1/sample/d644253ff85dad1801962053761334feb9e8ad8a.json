Maintaining two meters of distance from others is a key element of social distancing not reflected in mobility changes measured in kilometers. Our study also has an underrepresentation of extremely rural areas because we required at least ten 8-hour smartphone traces per day to maintain privacy; findings might not be generalizable to these areas. The distributions of jobs that are amenable to remote work-from-home likely also vary by rurality, but we did not have data to test this hypothesis beyond commute times. We intentionally did not analyze positive-among-tested coronavirus counts because of strong variation between states leading to selection bias (e.g., diagnostic suspicion bias for test eligibility).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Limitations"}, {"text": "This study is innovative in using smartphone location tracking for measuring the extent of public health interventions on a national scale. We found that the adoption of social distancing practices was strongly correlated with better community health and financial resources. Our findings also suggest the need to innovate additional measures to prevent viral transmission in places where social distancing is less feasible.
