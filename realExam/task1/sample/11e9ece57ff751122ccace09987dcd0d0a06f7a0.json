Abstract. The major purpose of the presented study is to analyze and find the solution for the model of nonlinear fractional differential equations (FDEs) describing the deadly and most parlous virus so-called coronavirus . The mathematical model depending of fourteen nonlinear FDEs is presented and the corresponding numerical results are studied by applying the fractional Adams Bashforth (AB) method . Moreover, a recently introduced fractional nonlocal operator known as Atangana-Baleanu (AB) is applied in order to realize more effectively. For the current results, the fixed point theorems of Krasnoselskii and Banach are hired to present the existence, uniqueness as well as stability of the model. For numerical simulations, the behavior of the approximate solution is presented in terms of graphs through various fractional orders.

Various types of fractional order or nonlocal derivatives were proposed in the present literature to transact the reduction of a traditional derivative.

The growth and decay of various compartment is different that some compartments are growing with different rate due to fractional order and similar behavior may be observed for decay of some compartments. Lower the order faster is the growing rate and vice versa and similarly the decay also is different at different fractional order. Therefore fractional calculus can help in understanding the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus-19 disease. Also the concerned numerical scheme can be used as a powerful tools to perform numerical simulation of such complicated model.
