            "text": "Every year, over 1,500,000 individuals in the US are diagnosed with cancer. Cachexia (involuntary 63 loss of muscle and adipose tissue) is present in up to 80% of cancer patients, is strongly associated 64 with higher morbidity and mortality, and is reported as the direct cause of death in 20-40% of these 65 patients (Dewys, Begg et al., 1980 , Fearon, Strasser et al., 2011 . Adipose tissue, once considered 66 only a high-energy fuel reserve, has emerged recently as an active metabolic organ modulating 67 inflammation, energy expenditure and food intake in non-cancer settings (You & Nicklas, 2006) . 68 Accelerated loss of adipose tissue plays an important role in cancer cachexia contributing 69 significantly to the increased morbidity and mortality seen in this setting (Fouladiun, Korner et al., 70 2005) . 71 72 Increased inflammation is common in the setting of cancer (Garcia, Garcia-Touza et al., 2005) and 73 is associated with adipose tissue wasting in human studies (Lerner, Hayes et al., 2015) . White 74 adipose tissue (WAT) is a significant source of inflammatory cytokines accounting for more than 30% 75 of circulating interleukin (IL)-6 (Michaud, Boulet et al., 2014) and this and other inflammatory 76 cytokines have been linked to WAT atrophy in the setting of cancer (Petruzzelli, Schweiger et al., 77 2014, Tsoli & Robertson, 2013 , Tsoli, Swarbrick et al., 2016 . Also, a phenotypic switch from WAT to 78 brown adipose tissue (BAT) known as \"browning\" is thought to contribute to the overall increase in 79 energy expenditure and WAT atrophy seen in cancer cachexia (Petruzzelli et al., 2014) . 80 Nevertheless, the mechanisms regulating adipose tissue atrophy and dysfunction in this setting are 81 incompletely understood. 82 9 EE levels in response to LLC tumor implantation when compared to Ghsr +/+ . Animals 174 co-administered ghrelin were not statistically different from vehicle-treated, tumor-bearing animals. 175 Tumor implantation also decreased spontaneous locomotor activity in both genotypes and ghrelin 176 administration did not prevent these changes . The respiratory quotient (RQ), was 177 significantly decreased by tumor implantation and was not affected by genotype or ghrelin 178 administration (Fig 5 G-I) . Adipose tissue atrophy is a central component of the cancer anorexia and cachexia syndrome 182 (CACS) leading to increased morbidity and mortality (Das, Eder et al., 2011) . Recently, emerging 183 roles for inflammation, WAT browning and increased BAT thermogenesis have been demonstrated 184 in this setting (Daas, Rizeq et al., 2018 , Dalal, 2019 , Han, Meng et al., 2018 , Kir, White et al., 2014 Kliewer, Ke et al., 2015 , Petruzzelli et al., 2014 , Rohm, Schafer et al., 2016 2019, Wang, Zhu et al., 2019) ; however, the pathways involved and their potential as therapeutic 187 targets are not well-known. Ghrelin and agonists of its only known receptor, show 188 potential to ameliorate CACS at least in part by preventing fat atrophy, but the specific mechanisms 189 mediating these effects have not been fully characterized. Given that there are no treatments for cancer cachexia and that several clinical trials targeting this pathway have failed to 191 meet their primary endpoints (Garcia et al., 2015 , Temel, Abernethy et al., 2016 , there is a pressing 192 need to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of action of ghrelin in this setting. In this 193 study we show that ghrelin prevents LLC tumor-induced weight loss, fat atrophy and WAT 194 inflammation without affecting tumor-induced BAT inflammation, WAT browning, and increased BAT 195 uncoupling and whole-body energy expenditure. We confirmed that its orexigenic effects are 196 GHSR-1a-dependent, and also show that other novel GHSR-1a-independent mechanisms are 197 involved given the partial improvements in fat atrophy and WAT inflammation seen in ghrelin-treated, 198 Ghsr -/animals. Also, this is the first report of macrophages as the source of WAT and BAT in the setting of CACS. Weight loss and survival rates are correlated with IL-6 levels in cancer patients (Garcia et al., 2005, 202 Moses, Maingay et al., 2009 , Scott, McMillan et al., 1996 . These observations and several 203 mechanistic studies support the premise that inflammation plays a central role in CACS. Increases 204 11 in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF contribute to anorexia (Baracos, Martin et al., 2018 , Braun, Zhu et al., 2011 , Khatib, 205 Gaidhane et al., 2018 , and TNF and IL-6 promote lipolysis and inhibit lipogenesis in WAT leading to 206 weight loss (Fearon, Glass et al., 2012 , Han et al., 2018 , Jeanson, Carriere et al., 2015 2014, Ruan, Hacohen et al., 2002) . In non-cancer settings, one third of the circulating IL-6 is 208 produced by WAT (Mohamed-Ali, Goodrick et al., 1997) and most of this WAT-derived IL-6 comes 209 from the stroma-vascular fraction composed of endothelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, 210 myocytes, and fibroblasts (Fain, Madan et al., 2004) , although it can also be derived from 211 adipocytes (Fain, 2006) . Macrophages in WAT are known to be the source of proinflammatory 212 cytokines in conditions leading to AT hypertrophy including obesity (Di Gregorio, Yao-Borengasser 213 et al., 2005 , Divoux, Tordjman et al., 2010 , Lumeng, Deyoung et al., 2007 ) but this has not been 214 previously shown in CACS. Here we show that LLC tumor implantation induces an increase in 215 inflammatory cytokines in circulation as well as in BAT and WAT. Moreover, these AT cytokines 216 appear to be derived exclusively from macrophages residing in these tissues. Adipose tissue 217 atrophy in cancer patients with CACS has been associated with an increase in subcutaneous AT 218 macrophages (Batista, Henriques et al., 2016 , de Matos-Neto, Lima et al., 2015 , Henriques, Sertie 219 et al., 2017 and tissue inflammation (Batista, Olivan et al., 2013 , de Matos-Neto et al., 2015 Henriques et al., 2017). Although, macrophage infiltration has also been described in WAT from 221 tumor-bearing rodents (Henriques et al., 2017 , Machado, Costa Rosa et al., 2004 2014), to our knowledge this is the first report of macrophages as the source of pro-inflammatory 223 cytokines in adipose tissue in CACS. These findings may explain why AT remains an important 224 source of pro-inflammatory cytokines even when the adipocyte mass is significantly reduced in this 225 setting. Also, this may be clinically relevant to cancer patients since knowing the source of 226 inflammation may allow us to target these pathways more effectively (Henriques, Lopes et al., 227 2018). Previously, we have shown that activation of GHSR-1a by ghrelin or GHSR-1a agonists (GHS) 230 increases food intake and body weight (13, 39, 40) . Our group and others also have shown that 231 ghrelin reduces fat oxidation and lipolysis and increases lipogenesis and adiposity in a rodent model 232 of cisplatin-induced cachexia by a combination of food intake-dependent and independent 233 mechanisms (Chen et al., 2015 , Garcia et al., 2013b , Porporato, Filigheddu et al., 2013 . Ghrelin is 234 thought to have anti-inflammatory effects in other settings (Deboer, Zhu et al., 2008 , Dixit, Schaffer 235 et al., 2004 , Tsubouchi, Yanagi et al., 2014 but this is not yet clear in CACS. Some reports suggest 236 an anti-inflammatory effect of native ghrelin administration, but this was not confirmed in other 237 studies using GHSR-1a agonists (Chen et al., 2015 , Garcia, Friend et al., 2013a . In the current 238 study, we report that ghrelin modulates inflammation in a tissue-specific manner. Ghrelin did not 239 prevent tumor-induced increases in circulating inflammatory cytokines or in BAT IL-1\u03b2 or MCP-1 240 protein levels. However, it mitigated LLC-induced inflammation in WAT. This effect was seen in both 241 genotypes although it was clearer in wild type animals partly because Ghsr -/mice appear to be 242 resistant to tumor-induced inflammation. GHSR-1a is not expressed in adipocytes (Sun, Garcia et 243 al., 2007) but is present in macrophages (Ma, Lin et al., 2013) and our findings are consistent with a 244 previous report showing that old, non-tumor-bearing Ghsr -/mice have reduced macrophage 245 infiltration, a shift on macrophage differentiation towards a more anti-inflammatory phenotype, and 246 decreased inflammation in adipose tissue (Lin, Lee et al., 2016) . However, a GHSR-1a-independent 247 effect of ghrelin on macrophages is also possible as it has been proposed in other settings (Avallone, 248 Demers et al., 2006 , Bulgarelli, Tamiazzo et al., 2009 , Lucchi, Costa et al., 2017 . Taken together, 249 our data is consistent with a WAT-specific, anti-inflammatory effect of ghrelin that is partly GHSR-1a 250 dependent. This is clinically relevant as GHSR-1a agonists are in clinical development for CACS 251 and their effect on these GHSR-1a independent pathways is not known (Garcia et al., 2015) . Also, 252 13 the differences we report between serum, WAT and BAT levels underscore the limitations of relying 253 exclusively on circulating cytokine levels when trying to determine the potential role of inflammation 254 in other tissues. 255 256 Energy expenditure is an important mechanism in the regulation of body weight and is increased in 257 CACS (Garcia et al., 2013a , Kir, Komaba et al., 2016 , Rohm et al., 2019 . Factors contributing to EE 258 include physical activity and resting EE (REE) (Silver, Dietrich et al., 2007, Vazeille, Jouinot et al., 259 2017) and adipose tissue can lead to an increase in REE by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in 260 mitochondria thereby releasing heat through activation of a proton leak (Nicholls, 1976, 261 Okamatsu-Ogura, Kitao et al., 2007) . In WAT, browning has been noted in multiple cancer cachexia 262 models with adipocytes showing an upregulation of the main regulator of thermogenesis, UCP1 263 (Dong, Lin et al., 2018 , Vaitkus & Celi, 2017 . In BAT, increased thermogenesis has been reported in 264 cachectic animals (Kir et al., 2014) independently of decreased food intake or their ability to 265 maintain their body temperature (Tsoli, Moore et al., 2012) . Proinflammatory cytokines have been 266 suggested as key drivers of WAT browning (Han et al., 2018 , Petruzzelli et al., 2014 and of BAT 267 thermogenesis through activation of sympathetic nervous system or targeting BAT directly (Arruda, 268 Milanski et al., 2010 , Dascombe, Rothwell et al., 1989 , Li, Klein et al., 2002 , Tsoli et al., 2012 . Here 269 we show that LLC-tumor implantation led to an increase in total EE in spite of a significant decrease 270 in physical activity, suggesting an increase in REE. This was associated with an increase in UCP-1 271 expression in WAT (browning) and in BAT. Moreover, these effects were more marked in Ghsr -/mice 272 suggesting a protective role of GHSR-1a in this setting. These results agree with previous reports in 273 aged, non-tumor-bearing Ghsr -/showing higher levels of thermogenesis and energy expenditure 274 when compared to aged-matched, wild-type mice (Lin, Saha et al., 2011) . The effect of ghrelin or 275 GHSR1a agonists on energy expenditure is unclear with some studies showing a decrease in EE 276 14 (Borner, Loi et al., 2016 , Villars, Pietra et al., 2017 while others showed no effect (Adachi, Takiguchi 277 et al., 2010 , Tschop, Smiley et al., 2000 , Vestergaard, Djurhuus et al., 2008 . In this study, we did 278 not see a significant effect of ghrelin on preventing LLC-induced fat browning, BAT thermogenesis, 279 increased REE or decreased physical activity in the setting of CACS despite the fact that ghrelin 280 prevented fat and weight loss and anorexia. We hypothesize that differences in the models, route of 281 administration and treatment regimen and agents used (LLC mice vs. C26 mice or hepatoma model 282 in rats, administration via s.q. vs. oral gavage vs. osmotic mini pump, ghrelin vs. GHSR1a agonists) 283 could account for these discrepancies. More studies will be needed to test this hypothesis. Calderon-Dominguez, Mir et al., 2016) . In CACS the aforementioned tumor-induced inflammation is 289 thought to play an important role in BAT thermogenesis (Petruzzelli et al., 2014 , Tsoli et al., 2012 ; 290 however, the source of inflammation in BAT is not known. Similar to WAT, we found that BAT IL-6 291 and TNF come exclusively from macrophages in the setting of cachexia. However, their expression 292 in BAT were lower than in WAT and no significant changes were found in response to tumor 293 implantation or ghrelin. We found a significant tumor-effect on increasing IL-1\u03b2 levels in BAT 294 although ghrelin did not prevent this increase, suggesting tissue-specific differences in inflammation 295 between BAT and WAT in response to tumor and ghrelin. Taken together, these results are 296 important because they show that tumor-induced WAT browning and BAT thermogenesis are 297 associated with significant increases in REE and appear to be independent of inflammation given 298 that downregulating inflammation does not prevent uncoupling in WAT and that BAT IL6 and TNF 299 levels were not upregulated upon tumor implantation. In addition, our data suggests that WAT is a 300 15 significant source of inflammatory cytokines, which express the highest levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and 301 TNF when compared to BAT and circulating levels. 302 303 There were limitations to our approach. This study was not set up to establish the safety of ghrelin 304 administration in the setting of cancer. Nevertheless, none of the studies published to date using 305 ghrelin or GHSR-1a agonists in mice or humans have shown an increase in tumor progression 306 (Sever, White et al., 2016) . Also, the experiments were not designed to characterize other 307 mechanisms contributing to the protective role of GHSR-1a in this setting. Lastly, our data suggest 308 that there is an alternative receptor for ghrelin although identification of this receptor remains elusive 309 and is the focus of other studies. 310",
