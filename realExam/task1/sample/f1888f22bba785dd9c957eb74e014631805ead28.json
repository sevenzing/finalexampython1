Although such linear models provide easy-to-read results, they are severely limited as they assume linearity and independence among variables. However, this might not be the case. For example, a specific variable might change its behaviour for different subsets of observations. More recently, researchers have applied Machine Learning (ML) techniques to study the same phenomenon [3, 8, 16] . However, their aim was mainly predictive. Thus, although linearity and independence among variables were tackled through the use of such algorithms, their results lacked interpretability. Finally, the intrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy does not hold when the goal of the analysis is the valuation of urban subspaces (like neighborhoods or street segments) instead of individual dwellings. To tackle these issues, we have devised an approach rooted in Urban Morphology to explain housing values at a fine level of spatial granularity, that of street segments and we designed a sequence of appropriate ML techniques that output interpretable results. To be more specific, the proposed approach, firstly, computes street-based measures of housing values, urban form, functions, and landscape and then models the relationship between them through an ensemble method comprising of Gradient Boosting (GB) [7] , topological Moran's test [14] , and SHAP [13] , a recently developed technique to interpret outputs of ML algorithms.

For example, bigger properties tend to be sold less frequently as they are more expensive and subject to long term investments, while smaller properties, due to their relative lower valuations, tend to be exchanged more easily and tend to be subject of shorter-term investments. The average price per square meter tends also to be structurally higher for small flats for technical reasons (even the smallest flat needs sanitary and cooking equipment, which proportionally weigh more on the average price per surface unit compared to a larger property). The very notion of average price per square meter can thus be challenged when applied to such diverse housing markets. To address these issues, instead of the conventional price per square meter, our method requires to separate the transactions by year and housing type and compute ventiles of prices for each subset year of transaction -housing type.

We perform such computation for the ensemble of each street segment and its immediate neighbouring streets. This for two reasons: firstly, transactions located in streets directly connected to one another tend to have similar valuations (due to the influence of the same location factors, presence of properties at the intersection of several streets segments, etc.); secondly, data on house prices tend to be quite sparse, even for several years, and thus a local interpolation allows us to increase the data coverage.

Since the parametric family of distribution used to fit the actual price distributions is unimodal, the most likely values for their parameters are those that make d 5 correspond to one of the modes. This is an intrinsic limitation introduced by the particular choice of a unimodal family of distribution, which was made to simplify the geographical interpretation of the result; however, despite this limitation, the results of the study seem to confirm the validity of the method used to construct the possibility distributions. Unsurprisingly, as the sampling rate decreases, the number of street segments for which the median is assigned a high possibility decreases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 427, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Validation of the Possibility Distribution"}, {"text": "To conduct our tests, we selected, among all possible predictive modeling methods, XGBoost [2] , which is the one that gave the best results when applied to dataset D based on a critical comparison and benchmarking of the most popular methods available. The rationale of this choice is that we wanted our solution to \"prove its mettle\" on a very challenging task, namely to prevent the degradation of the accuracy of the strongest available method when the supervisory signal becomes uncertain. We trained a model to predict the median of ventile prices (i.e., d 5 ) on dataset D by using XGBoost regression with the standard loss function and we trained another model on dataset D by using XGBoost regression instrumented with the proposed possibilistic loss function. We compare the results given by these two models when applied to a test set consisting of street segments not used to train the models. We treat the model trained on dataset D as the ground truth and we measure the deviation of the model trained on D from such a target.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 91, "end": 94, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Empirical Test of the Method"}, {"text": "As a measure of prediction error, we compute the RMSD of the median (d 5 ) predicted by the model trained on D for each segment, with respect to the median of that segment in D.

We split D into a training set containing 80% of the street segments and a test set containing the remaining 20% of the street segments. After training the model on the training set, we obtain an RMSD of 2.778556 on the test set. Figure 3 shows a plot of predicted vs. actual price ventiles for the test set. For comparison, XGBoost using the standard loss function based on MSE trained on 80% of D (therefore, with full information), gives an RMSD of 2.283798 when tested on the remaining 20%.
