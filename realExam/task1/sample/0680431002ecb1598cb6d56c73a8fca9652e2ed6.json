In a recent publication, among 210 asymptomatic women admitted for labour and delivery in New York hospitals, 14% had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, emphasising the utility of universal testing in communities with a high prevalence of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) infection [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 486, "end": 489, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 766, "end": 769, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The virus is highly infectious; the reproductive number (R 0 ), which represents the number of secondary infections resulting from an infected individual, is thought to be 2.6 (95%CI 1.5-3.5) [3] .

Hence, strategies to minimise exposure and the risk of disease transmission to healthcare workers or patients in the hospital is crucial. Peri-operative settings and emergency rooms are considered 'hot zones' for disease transmission, and measures to minimise exposure and transmission are vital in these areas [6] . One of the strategies to minimise exposure is to avoid aerosol-generating procedures such as airway management procedures commonly performed in the peri-operative period. General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which exposes the healthcare team to risk of transmission of COVID-19 both during tracheal intubation and extubation [7] . The odds of transmission of acute respiratory infection during tracheal intubation to a healthcare worker are thought to be 6.6 times compared with those who are not exposed to tracheal intubation [8] . Tracheal intubation for a COVID-19-positive patient is ideally performed in a negative pressure room, which may not be available in all places or situations [9] .

Careful consideration should be given to allow the surgery to be performed entirely under regional anaesthesia. An unplanned need for intra-operative conversion to general anaesthesia is the least desirable outcome. This requires excellent communication between the patient, anaesthetist and the surgical team. During the COVID-19 pandemic, preparation for anaesthesia and surgery sometimes entails screening all patients and determining the COVID-19 status (e.g. COVID-19 positive, suspected positive (could be under investigation)) [34]. If the community spread is low and a patient is asymptomatic or if tested COVID-19 negative, then regional anaesthesia can be provided following usual local institutional guidelines as before the pandemic. If the community spread of COVID-19 infection is significant, all asymptomatic patients should be presumed to be COVID-19 positive if no testing is being done or while test results are pending. The possibility of false-negative results should always be kept in mind. Data have suggested that there is significant variability in the comparative accuracy of different diagnostic modalities, and thus a high index of suspicion and maximising safety procedures is prudent [35]. It is estimated the infection attack rate (the probability of becoming infected) could reach 50-80% of the population, and until evidence suggests that it is safe to presume otherwise, all patients should be presumed to have COVID-19 infection [36]. Location Recommendations Care of COVID-19-infected patients should ideally be provided in the operating area and in an airborne infection isolation room if possible. Patients can be operated in a positive pressure room as long as there are measures to prevent airflow from the operating room into the common areas. If available, the care of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection should be provided in a negative pressure room. Nevertheless, surgeries have been safely performed in positive pressure rooms during the SARS outbreak and currently during the COVID-19 pandemic [37]. There is a theoretical risk of spreading the aerosolised particles to the corridors outside the operating room in a positive pressure room. However, operating rooms have a higher air exchange rate compared with hospital wards or floors. With a standard operating room with a minimum of 15 air exchanges per hour, 99% and 99.9% of airborne contaminants will be removed in 18 min", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection should be performed in the operating room, or a labour room for an obstetric patient. The use of common areas, such as a block room or a holding area, should be avoided to reduce the risk of cross infection. If possible, record keeping or electronic recordings should be done outside the room. Personal protective equipment Recommendations Regional anaesthesia procedures are not considered aerosol-generating, and therefore droplets precautions are recommended as a minimum (Fig. 2). Use of a higher level of precautions (airborne precautions) may be appropriate when caring for patients under spinal anaesthesia in the operating room in certain situations (Fig. 2). Patients should wear surgical facemasks to prevent transmission of COVID-19. Protection of healthcare workers when caring for a patient during the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates appropriate PPE, especially in light of PPE shortages. An appropriate level of PPE is determined by both the medical procedure and the proximity of a healthcare worker to the patient. Personal protective equipment can be classified into three levels (Fig. 2): contact precautions; droplet precautions; and airborne precautions [39]. A healthcare worker caring for a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient within 2 m should use droplet precautions if the procedure is not an aerosol-generating procedure.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "regional anaesthesia technique. The donning of PPE should occur before entering the room. The presence of an observer during the donning and doffing procedure is highly recommended. Simulation sessions should be conducted for training staff in donning and doffing of PPE [34]. Much confusion exists among providers as to: what the levels of PPE mean; whether the route of transmission is airborne or droplets and contact; and what is the difference between aerosol vs. droplet vs. droplet nuclei vs. airborne. Some of these concepts have been clarified in a recent review [39]. Such controversies existed in previous pandemics too. Several independent risk factors have shown to be responsible for nosocomial transmission of SARS, and the same may hold true for COVID-19. These include: a distance between beds of less than 1 m; resuscitation attempts; presence of symptomatic caregivers; the need for oxygen therapy; or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. While many of these domains may not be relevant to the practice of regional anaesthesia, oxygen therapy needs consideration. Oxygen therapy Recommendations The mode of delivery and flow rate of oxygen determines the possibility of aerosol generation and its travelling distance, therefore; the flow of oxygen should be kept to a minimum with the goal to maintain saturation while minimising aerosol generation. Oxygen supplementation can result in exhaled air jets and may result in droplet nuclei formation. Whether or not this may result in respirable infectious aerosols depends on a variety of factors, such as: the type of oxygen therapy utilised; the viral load in each breath; ventilation and air exchange in the room; and the use of facemask by the patient, among others. The type of oxygen therapy determines the travelling distances of the exhaled air with the least distance (0.4 m) seen with the use of a Hudson mask utilising 4 l.min \u00c01 of oxygen flow [43], followed by nasal cannula 1 m caudally with the use of 5 l.min \u00c01 of oxygen flow[44] and probably the maximum by a jet nebuliser (> 0.8 m laterally) when using 6 l.min \u00c01 oxygen flows[45].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Handheld ultrasound devices are preferable to larger units for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients.

It is advisable to rule out thrombocytopenia before attempting neuraxial techniques in a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient. Management of obstetric patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 during labour and delivery requires specific considerations [21]. The crucial physiological difference and urgency should be taken into consideration when making decisions regarding neuraxial procedures in pregnant women. Assessment of the suitability of neuraxial procedures requires balancing the risks of general anaesthesia. A factor that should be taken into consideration is the presence of any pre-operative respiratory compromise that may deteriorate due to further loss of functional residual capacity after neuraxial anaesthesia. Preliminary evidence suggests that thrombocytopenia might occur in patients with severe COVID-19 disease [53], while other data demonstrate lower platelet counts in COVID-19 positive patients compared with COVID-19", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Possible arrangements to allow the re-use of capnography sampling tubing between patients.

In general, the presence of COVID-19 infection in the absence of any other risk factors or laboratory abnormality is not a contra-indication for neuraxial procedures in obstetric or non-obstetric patients with COVID-19 infection [18, 22]. Routine indications and contraindications for neuraxial anaesthesia apply when managing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of obstetric patients in New York, tested positive for COVID-19 infection, among 18 consecutive women receiving neuraxial labour analgesia or anaesthesia for caesarean delivery, none had a contra-indication (e.g. thrombocytopenia or sepsis) for a neuraxial procedure, no haemodynamic instability was reported during the surgery, and no neurological complications were noted in the postpartum period [28]. Caution should be exercised when attempting to reduce the duration of the spinal anaesthetic by using short-acting spinal anaesthetics or reducing the dose of the spinal anaesthetic agent, as conversion to general anaesthesia is the least desirable outcome. Routine asepsis techniques being practised for non-COVID patients should still be followed. If available, an epidural positioning device could be used to reduce the contact of the assistant with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient. Currently, no dose adjustment for spinal anaesthesia or adjuvant opioids is recommended. However, a change to the epidural infusion regimen may be needed to reduce the need for additional top-up doses that require frequent patient contact.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "Our current understanding of COVID-19 spread suggests that coughing and sneezing lead to the generation of droplets.

There are concerns about anaesthetic machine contamination by the virus via end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, as the carbon dioxide sample line draws the gas sample directly without passing through a heat and moisture exchange filter. The contaminated gases generally enter the gas analyser through a water trap. The water trap of the anaesthesia machines includes a filter that typically filters approximately 99.999% of viruses. The filtering capacity of each filter can be obtained from the instruction manual provided by the manufacturer. However, the disposal of the water trap filter is recommended after use for an infected patient. Alternatively, use of a 0.2-micron membrane filter(Fig. 3), epidural filter or heat-moisture exchange filters can potentially allow the re-use of the water trap between the patients[23,60].", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "sympathectomy leading to hypotension. In terms of the risk of haematoma, a few deep peripheral nerve blocks are considered similar but still are less likely to cause compressive symptoms as the peripheral nerves are not enclosed in a spinal canal.Patient preparation and asepsis should be similar to that followed for the neuraxial procedure. If possible, attempts should be made to choose the block that is least likely to interfere with respiratory function. In other words, axillary or infraclavicular brachial plexus block may be chosen over supraclavicular brachial plexus block, and superior trunk block or other alternatives are preferred over interscalene block.The dose of pre-procedural sedation, if used, may need to be reduced to avoid any respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen. A safe dose of local anaesthetics should be calculated and used. Blocks should be performed with ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity[59]. The benefit of perineural adjuvants must be balanced against the risks of immunosuppression (dexamethasone); sedation; bradycardia and hypotension (clonidine and dexmedetomidine); drug errors; and drug contamination[26].The decision to insert and maintain perineural catheters needs to be made on a case-by-case basis. While continuous catheter techniques can be labour-and resource-intensive and may require frequent patient contact, the opioid-sparing effect of regional anaesthesia can be beneficial to a patient with respiratory morbidity.Hence, the use of inpatient perineural catheters should be evaluated based on patient needs and available resources.Ambulatory perineural catheters may still be utilised with clear patient instructions. Similarly, the risk-benefit ratio of analgesic peripheral nerve blocks and fascial plane blocks should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If the block is performed under general anaesthesia and requires repositioning of the patient, there is a risk of tracheal tube disconnection or dislodgement. Therefore, it may be advisable to choose a block that does not require patient repositioning (e.g. transversus abdominis plane blocks) over those that require repositioning (e.g. erector spinae plane block), if appropriate. In general, any additional analgesic block procedures should be avoided if adequate analgesia can be achieved using alternate regimens such as systemic analgesia. If the patient is not wearing a surgical mask during an upper limb procedure, the patient can be requested to turn the head away from the operator or plastic drapes can be used to limit droplet spread to the anaesthetist.Monitoring and conduct of anaesthesiaRecommendations Thorough testing for block success is encouraged to prevent the need for emergent conversion to general anaesthesia.Respiratory monitoring should be ideally performed with the use of viral filters.Both neuraxial anaesthesia and peripheral nerve block should be thoroughly tested for block success before proceeding with surgery to minimise the risk of conversion to general anaesthesia.
