There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon -polyester, cotton -polyester, poly(methyl methacrylate) -PVDF, lylon -PVDF and polypropylene -polyester have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective triboelectric charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m 2 , respectively. This smart mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple mechanism, self-driven (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities, e.g. breathing, talking, or other facial movements functionalities, and effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be potentially beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "While the ongoing outbreak of 2019-2020 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) gains significant prevalence worldwide, scavenging a curative remedy has become the main thrust to all scientists across the globe. Alike personal protective equipment (PPE), usage of homemade do-it-yourself (DIY) cloth mask has attracted global attention to combat novel coronavirus. Though the performance of various fabrics used in such a homemade mask is still under observation, their response is likely to be anticipated for combatting severe respiratory issues caused by the novel pandemics. In regards to the present scenario, the recent report by Konda et al. illustrated the filtration efficiency of differently combined fabrics depends on the particle size of aerosol, and its found to be promising for the wide bracketed size (10 nm-6\u00b5m) particles. Their study unveils aerosol filter made by the combination of chiffon and silk that are significantly efficient. 1 Therefore, a hybrid combination of non-woven fabrics having different threads count per unit shows effective filtration efficiency fornanosize particles. Improper and loose-fitting might prevent the working of that mask as the filtration is based on the principle of static electricity. Kutter et al. have well demonstrated the variation in the size of respiratory droplet, which are well known as aerosols (<5 \u00b5m) and droplets (>5 \u00b5m). 2 Among these, water droplets and liquefied gas droplets come into play as a medium on which SARS-CoV-2 can traverse over a long distance when the size is relatively small,.

As per the underlying precaution made by WHO 2020a, wearing a face mask is mandatory to combat COVID-19. 5 Another route of transmission might be of either only in passing or by traversingvirus contained aerosols. So in that case, the liquefied dropletsstart to evaporate immediately after the expiry of droplets and, someofthe smaller sized dropletstransported by air discharge field rather than gravitation. Such small virus-loaded droplets get enough liberation to traverse in the air several meters from their route. 6 Following five basic steps of aerosol filtration, the electrostatic attraction takes predominant role alike gravity sedimentation, inertial impaction, interception, and diffusion. [7] [8] All these mechanisms are solely size-dependent, i.e. gravitational forces come into play for larger sized droplets (> 1\u00b5m), whereas sedimentation and impaction are only applicable for medium-sized particles (> 1\u00b5m to 10\u00b5m). Lesser the size of the particles (100 nm-11\u00b5m), higher will be the tendency of those particles to get diffused by mechanical interception, and Brownian motion.Interestingly, nanosized particles can easily slide between the opening network of non-woven fibers. 9 In such cases, electrostatic attraction (EA) takes significance to bind and cling such particles to the fibers.
