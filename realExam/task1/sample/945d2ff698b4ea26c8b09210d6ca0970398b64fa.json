They can only extend patient survival by approximately 3 months. 3,4 Other drugs in second-line therapy, including several TKIs and immune checkpoint inhibitors, show slight survival advantages and antitumor activities, have limited therapeutic efficacy. 5 Thus, there is obviously a need for more effective therapeutic agents for HCC patients.",

We then demonstrated that one high-affinity NT-dependent Ab, G1A8, and its close variant Ab, HS29, effectively inhibit FGF19-induced HCC cell proliferation in vitro and significantly suppress HCC tumor growth in cell linederived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Importantly, G1A8 did not affect FGF19-mediated repression of mouse hepatic Cyp7a1 transcription. Moreover, G1A8 did not cause bile-acid-related side effects in cynomolgus monkeys. Collectively, our study demonstrates that selectively targeting the NT of FGF19 with an Ab can be both effective and safe, and the Abs we developed, G1A8 and HS29, show strong promise to be further developed into a safe and therapeutic agent for treating FGF19-driven HCC.",

Compared to full-length FGF19, the FGF19 \u2206NT variant had significantly weaker binding affinity for FGFR4 (either in the presence or absence of its co-receptor KLB), and exerted significantly reduced activity to induce tumor cell proliferation ( Figure   S1A ,B). To compare the bile-acid-regulatory function between fulllength FGF19 and FGF19 \u2206NT , we tested them in a mouse model in which exogenous FGF19 can exert its bile-acid-regulatory function through binding to the murine receptor FGFR4-which shares 90% amino acid identity with human FGFR4-to repress the murine hepatic transcription of Cyp7a1. 28, 32 In this mouse model, we observed no difference between full-length FGF19 and FGF19 \u2206NT in repression of the hepatic Cyp7a1 gene expression level ( Figure S1C ).

The NT (residues 23-39, corresponding to residues 1-17 of FGF19 following signal peptide cleavage) is intrinsically flexible as revealed by two previously determined FGF19 structures. 32, 33 Consistently, in our FGF19/G1A8 complex structure, these NT residues are also disordered; only residues 38-45 that engage extensive interactions with the six CDR loops of G1A8 show well-ordered electron density. Thus, both the intrinsic flexibility of the NT and the limited number of targetable epitope residues at the NT contribute to the challenges of obtaining NTselectively targeting Abs.",

The crystal structure of FGF19's CT tail bound to soluble KLB has been determined, 41 42 It remains to be determined whether FGF19, KLB, and FGFR4 form a ternary and/or quaternary complex in a similar manner. As FGFR4 is the essential and indispensable receptor for mediating both FGF19's physiological function in regulating bile acid metabolism and its tumorigenic activity in driving the pathogenesis of HCC, [43] [44] [45] it is therefore especially important to uncover the structure-function relationships that govern FGF19's tumorigenic and bile-acid-regulatory activities.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, our current understanding is that the CT of FGF19 determines FGF19's binding specificity towards co-receptor KLB, 41,46-48 and thus FGF19's endocrine actions primarily function in the liver-the only tissue that highly expresses both FGFR4 and KLB; the NT of FGF19 may be essential for its tumorigenic activity but may not be required for its physiological bile-acid-regulatory function ( Figure S1 ). [26] [27] [28] 45, 49 It appears that the NT 38-42 residue region of FGF19 (the critical binding site for G1A8 and HS29) can contribute to FGFR4 activation with respect to hepatocyte proliferation, which is independent of the binding between KLB and FGF19's CT. 48, 49 Moreover, recall that the aforementioned FGF19 NT variant, M70, exerts different biological activities-in bile acid regulation and tumorigenicity-but exhibits no difference in its binding affinity for its receptor FGFR4. 28 Specifically, M70 does not induce tumor formation owing to its inability to activate the STAT3 pathway downstream of FGFR4 compared to FGF19, but retains the ability to activate the FGFR4-dependent signaling pathways of bile acid regulation. 27, 28 It is intriguing how our NT-targeting Abs (GA18 and HS29) exert antitumor growth activities without causing obvious side effects related to FGF19's bile-acid-regulatory function. The unique features of our NT-targeting Abs likely result from their selective interruption of the FGF19-FGFR4 interactions that is required for tumorigenesis. Building on the aforementioned structural and functional findings, we surmised that the interaction of FGF19's CT with KLB plays the most critical role in tethering receptors and implementing all of FGF19's activities; whereas the globular NT F I G U R E 5 Evaluation of antitumor activity of HS29 in hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models.

The Ab treatment started at day 4 after tumor cell implantation, an early stage of tumor development. Monitoring of tumor growth over time by measuring tumor volumes and bioluminescence intensities showed that G1A8 and 1A6 each significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to the isotype control Ab; there was no significant difference between the two Abs (Figure 3A-C). We also evaluated G1A8's antitumor efficacy against xenograft tumors formed from transplanted WT Hep3B cells. Antibody treatment was started when tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm 3 in size at day 20 after tumor cell implantation, a relatively late stage of tumor development. Hep3B-bearing mice were divided into three groups with similar mean tumor volumes and received Ab treatment (10 mg/kg) twice each week for 3 weeks.

In the complex, the globular NT region and the rod-like CT region of FGF23 are critical for binding to FGFR1c and KLA, respectively. Heparin sulfate (HS) is required for the dimerization of the 1:1:1 FGF23-KLA-FGFR1c complex; the FGF23 signaling through FGFR1c depends on both KLA binding and HS-mediated dimerization.",
