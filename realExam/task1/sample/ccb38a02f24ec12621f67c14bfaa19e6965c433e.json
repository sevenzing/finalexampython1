Throat swab samples were collected and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR). Data was extracted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory values and treatments using electronic medical records. All patients who were hospitalized received a standard diagnosis and treatment based on \"Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)\" [3]. Follow-up throat swab specimens were obtained at intervals of 4\u00b12 days from when symptoms began to improve, including fever reduction or improvement in chest CTs. The date of symptom onset was defined as the day when initial symptoms were noticed. T1 referred to the duration from symptom onset to when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative two consecutive times, which indicated the duration of viral RNA shedding. The date of fever resolution was defined as the first day when the axillary temperature of a patient was no longer > 37.3\u2103 after admission. T2 was defined as the duration from the date of fever resolution to rRT-PCR conversion. A hazard ratio (HR) of <1 indicated prolonged viral RNA shedding. This study was approved by the ethics commission of all hospitals (S2020-055, S2020-056, 2020-YJ-046.01) where patients were observed and the requirement of informed consent was waived.",

In this study, most patients showed a negative PCR for viral RNA within 30 days, where the longest time observed was 44 days. Moreover, since many patients had a fever during the course of the disease, the median time from fever resolution to rRT-PCR conversion was 7 days, with a range between 0 and 28 days. However, owing to the fact that PCR tests sometimes show false negative results, it is best to repeat this at least 2 times. Based on the results, it is recommended that patients continue to follow prophylactic measures including wearing masks even after being discharged from the hospital.",

Most patients (96%) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA within 30 days after symptom onset. The median time of T2 was 7 days (IQR 4-10). However, 36 patients tested negative for viral RNA and then achieved fever resolution and 4 patients still had a fever when discharged. Furthermore, we explored the risk factors involved in prolonged viral RNA shedding using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR=0.619, 95%CI: 0.411-0.933, P=0.022), albumin levels (HR=1.027, 95%CI: 1.005-1.049, P=0.014) and the initial time of antiviral treatment (HR=1.467, 95%CI: 1.187-1.815, P<0.001) were independent factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. The median time for viral RNA shedding in patients with or without CHD were 21 days and 19 days, respectively (Figure 1b). Patients with CHD showed prolonged viral RNA shedding (P=0.029). Patients with albumin \u226535g/L had a shorter duration of viral RNA shedding compared to those with albumin <35g/L and the median times were 18 days and 20 days, respectively(Figure 1c). The median time for patients who started antiviral therapy within or later than 7 days after symptom onset were 18 days and 21 days, respectively(Figure 1d).",
