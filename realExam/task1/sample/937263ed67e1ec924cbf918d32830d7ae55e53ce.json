The universally adopted strategy of reducing social interaction to avoid the spread of COVID-19, termed social distancing, has considerable implications for the ongoing care of chronically ill patients [5, 6] . Patients living with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and other similar chronic conditions require periodic check-ups to ensure prevention of an acute episode of illness and the effectiveness of therapy [7] . One such patient group is those receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin as these patients need their international normalized ratio (INR) monitored regularly [8] .",

            "text": "Warfarin is primarily initiated during hospital admission, and patients are referred to primary care for continuation and monitoring. Regardless of the setting in which warfarin is first initiated, clinicians need to assess (or reassess) the indication for warfarin as outpatient therapy. Conditions necessitating warfarin therapy include atrial fibrillation [12] , cardioembolic ischemic stroke [13] , prosthetic heart valve [14] , venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis [15] and pulmonary embolism [16] ), and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [17] . Some of these indications, such as ischemic stroke and prosthetic heart valve, require lifelong anticoagulation treatment, whereas indications such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may not require indefinite anticoagulation and patients should undergo careful re-evaluation of their need for ongoing warfarin therapy. Patients with prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who have completed 3-6 months of warfarin therapy may be considered for cessation of treatment where appropriate. Continuing anticoagulation beyond 3-6 months is not routinely considered in patients with a provoked episode of venous thromboembolism with transient risk factors (assuming the risk factor is no longer present), isolated distal deep vein thrombosis, subsegmental or incidental pulmonary embolism, or a high risk of bleeding [18] . Patients who continue warfarin therapy indefinitely for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism require reassessment of bleeding risk, since a high/very high bleeding risk may outweigh the benefits of reducing the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism event with warfarin therapy. Therefore, warfarin therapy may no longer be appropriate (however, re-initiation of anticoagulation may be needed once the bleeding risk becomes reasonable) [19] . Patients with atrial fibrillation for whom sinus rhythm has been restored, either spontaneously or deliberately, also require assessment of their ongoing need for warfarin therapy. Warfarin therapy is indicated up to 4 weeks after the restoration of sinus rhythm because of the high likelihood of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the first month after reversion to sinus rhythm and the risk of transient post-cardioversion atrial stunning in the immediate peri-cardioversion period. However, continuation of long-term warfarin therapy 4 weeks post-restoration of sinus rhythm should be guided by the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc or CHADS 2 score and consideration of the long-term bleeding risk using the HAS-BLED score [20] [21] [22] .",

While DOACs do require periodic renal function monitoring throughout the treatment course (at least annually or when clinically indicated), monitoring is predictable and less rigorous than the INR testing required for warfarin therapy so offers convenience for both clinicians and patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic [23] . Moreover, important additional advantages of the DOACs include the lack of susceptibility to dietary interactions and markedly reduced susceptibility to drug interactions, which somewhat alleviates the need for the intensive in-clinic patient counseling required during initiation and maintenance of warfarin therapy. Anticoagulation with each of the DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) has led to similar or lower rates of both ischemic stroke and major bleeding compared with adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in large randomized trials [24] . In addition, large randomized trials and meta-analyses have reported the safety and efficacy of these agents for the treatment and prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Most of these trials were designed as noninferiority trials comparing DOACs and standard anticoagulation (i.e., heparin followed by warfarin) and showed comparable safety and efficacy [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

In addition, a switch to DOACs may be inappropriate in the following clinical situations that lack evidence or clinical experience: patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; pregnancy, breastfeeding, or planning a pregnancy; a target INR higher than the standard range of 2.0-3.0; severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 15 ml/min); severe hepatic impairment; active malignancy/chemotherapy; extreme obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m 2 or body weight > 120 kg); or concurrent interacting drugs [33] . To further illustrate, DOACs are not used in patients with significant mitral valve disease because they were excluded from the clinical trials of these newer agents so further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of DOAC in this setting. A review of currently available data provided reassurance for the use of DOACs in patients with a body mass index \u2264 40 kg/m 2 or body weight \u2264 120 kg, but whether clinically adequate drug concentrations can be attained with standard dosing of DOACs beyond these weight parameters remains to be determined [35] . Patient-specific circumstances such as issues of affordability may also affect the uptake of DOACs, since warfarin therapy is much cheaper than DOACs. Nevertheless, generic dabigatran is available in several countries following the expiry of dabigatran's patent protection. Also, nonadherent patients are unsuitable candidates for DOACs as the short half-lives of DOACs can easily leave the patient inadequately anticoagulated compared with warfarin therapy, and cost issues. c Only for patients with venous thromboembolism.

Commercially available LMWHs include enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, bemiparin, and nadroparin. LMWHs and fondaparinux have a better correlation between dose and anticoagulant response, permitting administration of a fixed weightbased dose without close laboratory monitoring [41] . Though the need for daily subcutaneous injections may make them an undesirable option from the patient's perspective, adequate counseling and appropriate training for patients or caregivers on the correct injection technique may overcome the initial anxiety. Patients or their caregivers should be able to demonstrate the correct injecting technique after receiving appropriate training. Pharmacists involved in dispensing LMWHs should particularly ensure the most appropriate syringe size is selected for the patient, and each patient should be provided with sharps containers for the correct disposal of used syringes. Fondaparinux is supplied in prefilled syringes, so selection of syringe size is not an issue, but patients should still be provided with sharps containers. LMWHs and fondaparinux can be administered subcutaneously in weight-based dosing for the treatment of porcine-derived heparin may be a concern for Muslim patients; 1-month supply is difficult to handle Fondaparinux: lack of clinical experience in breastfeeding patients venous thromboembolism [15, 18, 42] , including patients with concomitant cancer [43] requiring full anticoagulation for \u2265 3 months. Prescribing clinicians must assess complete blood count and renal function (and serum potassium for LMWHs) before initiating LMWHs or fondaparinux and during therapy when clinically indicated. Patients should also be weighed at treatment initiation to calculate the correct dose. Nevertheless, data are sparse on whether patients with extreme obesity should be given weight-based or fixed LMWH doses, but pharmacodynamic data in patients weighing > 100 kg suggest that patients weighing \u2264 160 kg may receive a full calculated weight-based dose of LMWHs [44] . Conversely, the anticoagulation effect of fondaparinux is uncertain in patients with body mass index > 35 kg/m 2 [45] . Beyond these weight parameters, patients should be maintained on warfarin as their anti-Xa levels should be closely monitored to ensure effective anticoagulation, which renders the reason for switching to LMWHs or fondaparinux redundant [44] . Patients receiving LMWHs should receive appropriate education and counseling to ensure they are aware of the early symptoms of thrombocytopenia (unexplained thrombosis, necrotic skin lesions at injection sites) because LMWHs are infrequently associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with a meta-analysis reporting a rate of 1.2% in patients with venous thromboembolism [46] . Similar to DOACs, some considerations to be considered in the decision-making process is that maintaining patients on LMWHs or fondaparinux costs more than maintaining patients on warfarin (per unit price: fondaparinux > enoxaparin > warfarin), and supply of these parenteral anticoagulants may be limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus necessitating patient prioritization criteria.",

Generally, the major guidelines recommend that the interval between INR testing should not extend beyond 12 weeks, but flexibility could be allowed to monitor less frequently than every 12 weeks in the most stable patients, similar to those in clinical trial populations, during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for patients in self-isolation because of possible COVID-19 exposure [67] [68] [69] . However, INR testing intervals should be extended cautiously in carefully selected patients because a prospective study reported that a large proportion of patients with previously stable INRs were unable to maintain stable INRs during extended-interval follow-up (every 12 weeks) [70] .",
