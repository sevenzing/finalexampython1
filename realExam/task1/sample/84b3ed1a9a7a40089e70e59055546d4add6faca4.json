            "text": "Drug shortages have become all too familiar in the health care environment, with over 200 drugs currently on shortage. In the wake of Hurricane Maria in September 2017, hospitals across the USA had to quickly and creatively adjust medication preparation and administration techniques in light of decreased availability of intravenous (IV) bags used for compounding a vast amount of medications. Amino acid preparations, essential for compounding parenteral nutrition, were also directly impacted by the hurricane. Upon realization of the impending drug shortages, hospitals resorted to alternative methods of drug administration, such as IV push routes, formulary substitutions, or alternative drug therapies in hopes of preserving the small supply of IV bags available and prioritizing them for them most critical needs. In some cases, alternative drug therapies were required, which increased the risk of medication errors due to the use of less-familiar treatment options. Clinical pharmacists rounding with medical teams provided essential, patient-specific drug regimen alternatives to help preserve a dwindling supply while ensuring use in the most critical cases. Drug shortages also frequently occur in the setting of manufacturing delays or discontinuation and drug recalls, with potential to negatively impact patient care. The seriousness of the drug shortage crisis reached public attention by December 2017, when political and pharmacy organizations called for response to the national drug shortage crisis. In this article, we review institutional mitigation strategies in response to drug shortages and discuss downstream effects of these shortages, focusing on medications commonly prescribed in neurocritical care patients.",

On a daily basis, another drug shortage is realized that requires a change in product formulation and dispensing procedures, as well as the need to review alternative therapy options. Recently in the fall of 2017, US hospitals were affected by Hurricane Maria which devastated Puerto Rico, cutting off the supply of small-volume parenteral solutions for intravenous piggyback (IVPB) use nationwide. These solutions are essential to patient care and are used to compound agents ranging from antimicrobials and chemotherapy to analgesic, sedative, and hemodynamic support in critically ill patients. The hurricane also impaired manufacturing of amino acids, prompting a shift in delivering parenteral nutrition to patients requiring intravenous (IV) nutritional support. Subsequently, hospitals nationwide were affected by the IV opioid shortage in spring 2018. Oftentimes, therapeutic alternatives can be substituted; other times the shortages are more profound and can have drastic consequences. Frequent changes in medication formulations increase the risk of adverse medication events, including medication errors.",

In November 2017, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) hosted a Drug Shortages Roundtable with key stakeholders from multiple healthcare disciplines and organizations to review challenges and develop strategies to mitigate drug product shortage concerns [3, 4] . The group recognized improvements in place since the height of the shortage crisis in 2012, during which legislation was enacted requiring drug manufacturers to notify the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \"of any change in production that is reasonably likely to lead to reduction in supply\" of a covered drug in the USA. This advanced warning requirement has played a significant role in increasing the awareness of drug shortages, but it has not solved the problem [4] [5] [6] .",

ASHP has recently updated guidelines on the subject as well, suggesting national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidance on patient prioritization when drug supply is scarce [7] . In spring of 2018, the FDA published several statements and action plans addressing the seriousness of drug shortages caused by manufacturing processes and supply chain availability [8, 9] . The FDA's involvement has included extending expiration dating for select products, expediting review of new drug applications, and allowing importation from other countries. The FDA has the authority to exercise regulatory discretion to allow manufacturers to import medically necessary drugs following evaluation of foreign firms and drug products for quality control [5] .",

Unfamiliar alternative therapies could lead to dosing, dispensing, and administration errors, inadequate monitoring of side effects, improper use of a medication altogether, and bypassing technology safeguards such as medication barcode scanning [10] .

The group discussed the different strategies that institutions have identified to effectively troubleshoot shortages to minimize effects on patient care. Health systems pharmacy departments have altered and created numerous processes in an attempt to minimize impact on patient care. These management strategies on a health system level have included adjustments in staffing models for pharmacists and technicians, implementing restricted use criteria (i.e., by prescriber, unit, diagnosis, and enteral access status), investigating alternative administration strategies, procuring alternative preparations of the same medication, allowing temporary use of non-formulary alternatives, centralizing supply by removing medications from automated dispensing cabinets and code carts, and provision of therapeutic substitution policies. Specific to shortages of products that require IVPB for administration, hospitals have implemented diverse strategies: enabling protocols that allow pharmacists to automatically convert routes of administration, product changes of IVPB using various adapters, use of alternative preparations (i.e., use of premixed products instead of compounding or vice versa), and limiting use of IVPB by allowing nurses to administer select medications as IV push. Herein, we discuss alternative therapeutic management strategies to recent or current shortages within neurocritical care.",

Benzodiazepines including diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam are routinely used first line for seizure cessation and are available in a variety of formulations and routes of administration [17, 18] . As a result of Hurricane Maria in 2017, institutions were challenged with administering IVPB ASDs due to the lack of small-volume IV fluid bags used for dilution. ASDs that can be administered as IV push instead of an intermittent infusion include: fosphenytoin, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and valproic acid. As a result of the IV fluid shortage, institutions preserved supply by switching to IV push administration of these agents. In recent years, there have also been manufacturer shortages with first-line agents, such as lorazepam and diazepam, in addition to maintenance drugs, such as fosphenytoin, levetiracetam, and ketamine.

Patients deemed to be experiencing severe dehydration or who were unable to take liquids by mouth were excluded from the protocol. The authors administered 500 to 1000 mL of oral fluids, including oral electrolyte solutions, water, dilute juice, or dilute sport drinks. Considerations for use of specific products on the basis of concomitant disease states such as renal disease, diabetes mellitus, or heart failure were recommended. Patients were instructed to drink 30 mL (two large sips) every 3-5 min with specific instructions for drinking goals and the use of tracking sheets. Comfort medications such as analgesics, antipyretics, and anti-emetics were administered as needed. Through the use of this protocol, the authors were able to reduce the use of IV fluids by an estimated 30%.

Additionally, the American Heart Association guideline for the management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage recommends against the administration of rFVIIa because it fails to replenish all of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and does not restore thrombin generation as effectively as PCC [46] . The INR is particularly sensitive to factor VII levels and may decrease despite inadequate levels of factors II, IX, and X that are required for hemostasis [35] . It also has a very short half-life of about 3 h leading to INR rebound [47] . rFVIIa is associated with a high rate of thrombosis (12.8-24%), including a 5% excess risk of arterial thrombosis compared to placebo with intraparenchymal hemorrhage [35, 48] .",

Anecdotally, many neurointerventionalists with prior experience with intra-arterial abciximab have begun using intra-arterial tirofiban or eptifibatide depending on their institution's formulary. According to small case series, no significant differences have been demonstrated in recanalization rates or outcomes when intra-arterial versus IV administration of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was evaluated. Similarly no significant differences in efficacy were found when abciximab, an irreversible agent, was compared with the reversible agents tirofiban and eptifibatide in these case series [54] . Of note, a limited meta-analysis has demonstrated higher recanalization rates with the reversible GPIIb/IIIa agents compared to abciximab [55] . From a practical standpoint, tirofiban compared to abciximab is less expensive, does not require a filter needle or refrigeration prior to administration, and has a shorter effective half-life of hours compared to days. These practical benefits are tempered by less evidence and less clinical experience by neurointerventionalists. Further, in the setting of bleeding, tirofiban inhibits platelets administered by platelet transfusion until it is eliminated since it reversibly inhibits platelets. Abciximab irreversibly inhibits platelets and will inhibit platelets administered by platelet transfusion up to 30 min after the drug administration. Beyond 30 min, most free drug has been eliminated and the remaining abciximab is unable to release from its binding site. There are no head-to-head studies comparing bleeding risks in the neurointerventional patient population. Providers need to ensure that tirofiban dosing is adjusted in the setting of renal dysfunction (CrCl < 60 mL/min).",

In order to minimize the risk of conversion errors, each institution should utilize a uniform conversion tool that is approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and the anesthesia team. Since opioid product availability may vary from week-toweek, guidance should be provided to assist clinicians for the purpose of helping to reserve certain opioids for specific patient populations. Furthermore, the electronic health record should be updated to display opioid options that match products currently in stock as well as providing alternative alerts with other options. Inventory control strategies should include reserving supplies of specific IV opioids for specific indications and limiting their placement to those areas with those indications. For example, IV fentanyl may be restricted to areas such as the operating rooms, emergency room, and the intensive care units. Stock of injectable opioids should be optimized in automated dispensing cabinets after reviewing usage patterns. Table 5 provides an example of an institutional plan for navigating through the shortages.",

Several information systems may require updates in the setting of drug shortages including the electronic medical record, clinical decision support systems, CPOE, pharmacy information systems, automated dispensing cabinets, and smart infusion pumps [60] . Updates to technology that normally take weeks to months to implement may be needed within days to weeks in the setting of unanticipated drug shortages. As soon as a drug shortage is identified, surveillance reports can be utilized to identify patients who have active orders for the drug and provide estimations for typical monthly usage to gauge the impact of the drug shortage of in the institution. Pharmacists can work with providers to identify alternative agents or routes of administration (e.g., IV to oral) for patients affected by the drug shortage to ensure continuity of care [61] . Clinical decision support systems within the CPOE system can assist providers with medication ordering. Drug shortage alerts can be incorporated into the CPOE system to communicate restricted use and/or direct providers to an alternative therapy [62] . Once the shortage is resolved, discontinuation of the alert should occur. [61] This strategy allows for Table 5 Example of institutional opioid shortage mitigation guidance ED emergency department, GI gastrointestinal, ICU intensive care unit, IR interventional radiology, OR operating room, PCA patient-controlled analgesia *Criteria for fentanyl boluses: acute neurologically injured patients (e.g., traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, or intracranial bleeding); trauma patients age \u2265 65, SBP < 110 mm Hg or high risk for hemorrhagic shock; trauma patients age < 65, SBP < 90 mm Hg or high risk for hemorrhagic shock; procedural sedation if morphine is contraindicated (e.g., concerns for histamine release, due to hemodynamic instability); mechanically ventilated with hemodynamic instability (SBP < 110 or MAP < 65) to facilitate analgosedation when morphine is contraindicated; targeted temperature management; contact pain service or clinical pharmacist for concerns or recommendations; utilize oral therapy and multimodal therapy for pain management as much as possible real-time proactive communication for providers considering initiating a therapy on shortage [7] . As product availability can vary frequently, automated dispensing cabinet and CPOE systems should be updated accordingly. Initial strategies for drug shortages may include adjusting par levels of medications stocked in the automatic dispensing cabinets [7] . Prioritizing distribution of short-dated (i.e., soon-to-expire) medications allows for increased time of drug utilization, less inventory required to order, and decreased waste [63] . Throughout the process, it is essential that the CPOE and pharmacy system product preference list is updated accordingly. Medication package selection (e.g., a 2 mL vial of diazepam 5 mg/mL versus 10 mL vial of diazepam 5 mg/mL) may prefer products stocked on the unit in the automated dispensing cabinet over those distributed from central pharmacy. As such, manipulation of inventory available in the automated dispensing cabinet can facilitate correct product selection on order verification [7] . If a shortage becomes significant enough to deplete central pharmacy supply, centralization of inventory may be required to allow for distribution of medication to patients throughout the hospital. If unit-dosed medications are on shortage, purchasing of bulk bottles and repacking into smaller dosage units may help mitigate the impact of drug shortages until resolution.",

The authors hypothesized that the increase in mortality was due to a combination of the use of potentially inferior vasopressors for septic shock such as phenylephrine and dopamine, lack of familiarity with alternative options, and inadequate optimization of supply management during the shortage. Another retrospective study of three intensive care units (ICUs) in Vienna in which remifentanil was the continuous infusion analgesic of choice demonstrated a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital length of stay associated with a remifentanil shortage [66] . The authors postulated that the use of unfamiliar and longer-acting alternatives may have led to suboptimal dosage adjustments and prolonged respiratory depression, impairing ventilator weaning. Additional studies are needed to assess the impact of drug shortages on patient outcomes.",
