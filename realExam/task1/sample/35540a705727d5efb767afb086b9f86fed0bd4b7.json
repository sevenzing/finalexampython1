In gnotobiotic lambs, inoculation with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) resulted in diarrhea with a typical clinical picture and patho-anatomical findings. E. coli adhered to the mucosa of the digestive tract at counts amounting to IO5 per cm2. In these lambs, disturbances of intestinal biochemical processes became evident; proteolytic enzyme activity was significantly reduced. Preventive administration of Lactobacillus cusei inhibited the negative effects of ETEC in gnotobiotic lambs, minimized the clinical signs to those of a very moderate diarrhea in the first 12 h after inoculation and significantly reduced the patho-anatomical findings. Enterotoxigenic E. coli counts decreased by 99.1 and 76% on days 2 and 4 after inoculation respectively, and amounted to lo3 per cm'. The inhibitory effects of L. casei against E. coli were most obvious in the jejunum and ileum. The numbers of adhering E. cofi increased from the duodenum with the length of the gut. ETEC counts in the digestive tract of lambs that had been preventively treated with L. casei amounted to 10' ml-'. It can be assumed that, in addition to competitive exclusion, the inhibitory effect of L. casei upon ETEC adherence was also mediated by a Lactobaciflus-produced substance that inhibited E. coli adhesion to the gut mucosa.",

            "text": "When rearing young animals, diarrhoic diseases present a serious health and economic problem. These may be caused by different infectious agents acting either separately or in association with other microorganisms and essential factors. Escherichia coli, salmonellae, rota-and coronaviruses as well as cryptosporidia play an important part in the etiology of the diarrhoic syndrome. In the young, enterotoxigenic E. coli appear to be the most frequent diarrhea-causing agents (Tzipori, 1981) ; they can be found in stables with a reduced level of husbandry where morbidity and mortality rates are high. Macrobacilli are a component of the natural microflora of the gut; they colonize the latter as early as within the first hours of life. They have rather beneficial effects upon the macroorganism and inhibit several pathogens. Raccach et al. (1989) and Sudirman et al. (1993) reported Lactobacilli to inhibit Lisreriae while and Chateau et al. (1993) observed these microorganisms to inhibit Staphylococci. According to Watkins et al. (19821, Foumiat et al (1992) and Lidbeck et al. (1987) Lactubacilli also inhibit pathogenic E. coli. Employing Lactobacilli in the form of probiotics that would be based on their inhibitory effects against pathogens seems to be a very efficacious method of preventing and treating diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms, mainly the diarrhoeic syndrome in the young of farm animals (Gilliland et al., 1980) . The administration of Lactobacilli containing probiotics is a biotechnological method having not only beneficial effects upon the health state of the young but also a positive impact on the environment. Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, L. lactis. L. reuteri, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis and L. delbruecki (Fuller, 1989; Jonsson and Conway, 1992) are those strains that are most widely incorporated in probiotic preparations.",

The pathogenicity of E. coli is conditional on two factors: the ability to produce enterotoxin (Smith and Gyles, 1970) and the presence of colonization factors enabling the carrier to colonize the mucosa of the small intestine (Bertschinger et al., 1972; Jones and Rutter, 1972) . The ability of enterotoxigenic E. coli to colonize the gut presents the primary and decisive pathogenic factor since it is inevitable for the second virulence factor -the enterotoxin -to exert its effects.",

            "text": "The mechanism of the effects of probiotics is widely discussed. It is very important that an essential stage in the pathogenesis of intestinal infections, especially diarrhoea of bacterial origin, involves the adhesion of the microorganisms concerned to the intestinal epithelial cells. In principle, bacterial diarrhoea could be treated by preventing adhesion of pathogenic bacteria (Foumiat et al., 1992) . The following methods are in use: 1. Vaccination against bacterial adhesion factors (Levine et al., 1983; Runnels et al., 1987) . 2. Administration of antibiotics which inhibit the expression of adhesion factors (Deneke et al., 1985; Chopra and Hacker, 1986) . 3. Oral administration of substances containing structures similar to those of the adhesion factors of pathogens (Neeser et al., 1988) or structures that mimic receptors of the intestinal mucosa (Mouricout et al., 1986) . Oral administration of certain strains of Luctobucilli has also been found to inhibit implantation of various pathogens in the digestive tract. This action may be due to nonspecific competitive inhibition of the adhesion of pathogenic strains to epithelial cells of the digestive tract (Barrow et al., 1980) . As can be seen from the results obtained, it was not only competitive inhibition that caused the inhibitory effect of L. cusei. This is testified by the low counts of L. cusei adhering to the epithelium of the digestive tract and the unreduced counts of E. coli in the gut contents. It can be concluded that L. cusei 294/89 produced unknown substance which inhibited the adhesion of ETEC either through blockage of receptors in the intestinal mucosa of lambs, or through disturbance of the adhesion factors or inhibition of their expression in E. coli. Similarly Blomberg et al. (1993) observed L. fermenturn 104R to produce a proteinaceous component detectable in spent culture fluid during growth in both complex and defined media; this component inhibited the adhesion of K88ab and K88ac fimbriae to ileal mucus by interacting with mucus components. Keeping in mind the prevention of clinical manifestation of the disease an anti-enterotoxic effect may also be considered. The anti-enterotoxic activity of Lactobacilli was also reported by Mitchell and Kenworthy (1976) . The administration of L. casei 294/89 proved to have rather beneficial effects upon gut biochemistry and to prevent a decrease in proteolytic enzyme activity observed after the inoculation of ETEC CCM 612. Further experiments will be conducted in order to study factors stimulating the inhibitory effects of Luctobacilli against ETEC and factors selectively supporting the adhesion of Lactobacilli. This may lead to the development of potentiated probioticsnew preparations for prevention and treatment.",
