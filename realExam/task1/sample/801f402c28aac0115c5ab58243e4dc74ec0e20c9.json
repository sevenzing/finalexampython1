The time at which the number of infected individuals starts decreasing cannot be reliably calculated before it is actually attained. A standard SIR model with confinement shows that infection spread is inhibited only above a threshold. Confinement induces a slow-down in the expansion phase that does not guarantee an eventual control of the epidemic. A Bayesian fit to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic in Spain shows that we can infer neither its peaking time nor whether there is a peak at all. The dispersion of possible trajectories grows extremely fast, yielding a short horizon for reliable prediction. As unpredictability is intrinsic, not due to incomplete or wrong data, our study advocates for a scenario of probabilistic forecasting.",

By means of a simple model [16] , he had shown that one can never be certain of whether, one week from now, we will have a sunny or a rainy day. Half a century later, we are used to listen to the weather forecast in terms of percentages, probability of rain, intervals for temperature and wind speed, and so on. Just fuzzy information, but usually sufficient to make up our minds on what to do next weekend. The key point is that, as far as weather is concerned, we accept that we are bound to cope with uncertainty. The mechanism behind that uncertainty has to do with the exponential amplification of small initial differences prototypical of chaotic systems. It turns out that also other systems with exponentially growing variables display an analogous behaviour: they are sensitive to small variations in parameters and amplify small differences, potentially leading to quantitatively and qualitatively different outcomes. Though their dynamics are not chaotic, that is the case of epidemics.",

But before we get into further details we would like to clarify what this paper is not: it is not another paper with a simple model aiming to predict the evolution of the epidemic. On the contrary, we intend to show that predicting with models like this one is severely limited by strong instabilities with respect to parameter values. The reason we work with such a minimal model is that we can obtain analytical expressions for the dynamics under sensible approximations and make the point more clear. Also, it allows us to derive simple facts about the epidemics, such as the existence of a threshold that separates \"mild\" confinement measures causing mitigation from stronger measures leading to the inhibition of infection propagation.",

Our model does an excellent job in reproducing past data but, instead of taking most likely parameter values (or empirically evaluated values) to draw a prediction, we estimate compatible ranges of variations in the parameters. Especially when the process is close to the mitigation-inhibition threshold, predictions of the next few days become extremely sensitive to changes in the parameters, and to the addition of subsequent empirical data. Altogether, it turns out that quantitative predictions made in any similar framework are not reliable if not accompanied by their likelihood. The main conclusion we reach is that the deterministic nature of SIR-like models is misleading if aimed at describing the actual course of any pandemic: prediction of the past is achieved through suitable fitting of data, and different functions may work, but prediction of the future in the mid-term cannot be trusted.",

Confinement bends the progression curve downwards, but this bending, which can span a remarkable (and essential) lapse of time, should not be interpreted as an unequivocal sign that propagation is to be inhibited. Rather, it might represent just a transient, cross-over regime to a new diverging, exponential phase, albeit with a different coefficient. In the simple SCIR model here discussed, these two regimes are clearly identified.",

The latter model discards the possibility that individuals do not commit to the confinement (analogous to setting p \u2192 0 in our model), while including possible advances in treating the disease through a recovery rate that increases with time and a death rate that decreases with time. A variant of such model has been subsequently used to draw very precise predictions on the course of epidemics [15] . A so-called SIRX model with irreversible quarantine has been shown to recover the systematic sub-exponential growth in the expansion phase [18] .

However, it is important to emphasize that a direct empirical estimation of the parameters need not be the right value to input the model with. Any simple SIR-like model is by definition leaving aside a number of realistic features. When fits of actual data are attempted, those models yield at best trajectories close to the actual one, but the inferred parameters are necessarily effective. Including or not the E state, confined individuals, age-structured populations or any other possible level of detail redefines the precise meaning and values of the corresponding rates.

First, incomplete or noisy data entail uncertain predictions, as can be seen in fits to all Spanish Autonomous regions,Fig. S5. But, even if data were complete and precise, small variations in the parameters bring about growing uncertainties as time elapses. In order to illustrate this point, we have generated a synthetic set of observations through direct integration of the system described inFigure 1.

If R 0 p(q + p) \u22121 > 1 the growth slows down before a new asymptotic phase of exponential growth sets in. This phase corresponds to mitigation of infection propagation, where eventual extinction will occur through the usual SIR mechanism of exhaustion of susceptible individuals, while the deceleration observed in between is just a cross-over between two exponentially diverging regimes. If the proportion of infected becomes high enough during the cross-over, our approximation is no longer valid and the SIR mechanism can kick in, making the second exponential regime unobservable in practice.Inhibition of infection propagation is achieved only if R 0 p(q + p) \u22121 < 1, where only a fraction of the population-which depends on the confinement strength and collective adherence-will get the disease. Though the model we have studied here is simple enough as to allow us to derive exact results and to characterize the nature of the turning point (or cross-over), the qualitative scenario should be shared by any other compartmental model with growing and decreasing phases dominated by exponential behaviour.",
