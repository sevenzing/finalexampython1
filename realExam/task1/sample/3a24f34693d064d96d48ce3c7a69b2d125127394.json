Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 24 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A statistical power analysis was not conducted for IOS outcomes (Jartti 2015).

Turner et al 6 demonstrated that the infant atopy is associated with the reduction of pulmonary function measured by rapid thoraco-abdominal compression technique or spirometry from the age of 1 month to 18 years. Moreover, Belgrave et al 7 found that number of early specific sensitizations correlated inversely with pulmonary function measured by plethysmography from the age of 3 to 11 years. Our finding extends these results by showing that atopic sensitization at the time of the first severe wheezing episode is associated with increased bronchial reactivity measured by IOS in addition to a reduction in pulmonary function in a long-term follow-up to the age T A B L E 2 Patient characteristics vs pulmonary function values, 2-sample t-test and linear regression analysis were used and results are expressed as regression coefficient beta or mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.

In our study, the mean age of the children during the pulmonary function testing was lower when compared to the earlier studies (mean 5 years vs 7.2-11 years), which may partly explain the negative results. The low sensitivity of IOS is another probable explanation for the negative results.

Although unproven, this may lead to better management of asthma already during early childhood and minor pulmonary function impairment at preschool age.Pulmonary function measurement in young children is technically challenging. IOS is a relatively new method and that has been shown to be promising from the age 2-3 years onward due to its requirements of minimum cooperation.20,21,24 Success rate of IOS in our study was 99%, and exercise testing was conducted successfully in 96% of the children. This supports the role of IOS as a preferred pulmonary function testing method in young children and exercise test as a practicable method for bronchial reactivity testing already in preschool-aged children.
