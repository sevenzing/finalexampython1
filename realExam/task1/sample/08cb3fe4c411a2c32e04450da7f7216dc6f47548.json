Produced by two of the country's most elite cultural institutions, the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center and the Beijing People's Art Theatre respectively, The Dying Kiss (Shengsi Zhiwen) in 2003 and Student Zhao Ping (Zhao Ping Tongxue) in 2005 represented a sea change in the political response to the epidemic while documenting public perceptions towards people living with HIV and AIDS in China. 1 Embedded within these plays are over fifteen years of associations and popular understanding (and misunderstanding) intertwined with core national values. 2 Such beliefs were not only reinforced but challenged in these plays, capturing the tension of a cultural moment in which the government was caught between restrictive ideology and a desire to be a global leader in the wake of a pandemic.",

Theatre at high-profile institutions was to serve as a powerful tool for prevention, stigma reduction and national image preservation. Government-appointed AIDS Ambassador and stage and screen celebrity Pu Cunxin communicated a vision for theatre's utility: \"We can't leave the arts out of the fight against AIDS but the arts must disseminate knowledge in an artistically superior waynot just spread education and propaganda. The power of real art is to move people, to reflect people's experiences\" (Pu 2005) . 3 These two high profile theatres provided a literal stage for the demonstration of government-sponsored efforts to turn the tide of the epidemic in China. Such a partnership was explicitly financial as well as ideological: The Dying Kiss was co-produced by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre and Student Zhao Ping was coproduced by the China Youth Fund for the Prevention of AIDS and Gobon Guilin Latex (a point discussed later in this essay). 4 Prior to these productions, government officials and the government-controlled media kept the virus separate from promoted views of Chinese nationalism, resulting in intense stigma for people living with HIV or AIDS. With new policies and such visible cultural leadership, a new commitment to HIV and AIDS prevention and care was palpable in the early twenty-first century.",

I then consider the modes of production and the sometimes subtle political content of each play in relation to shifts in governmental policy (with which both content and production are intertwined). Rooting my work in historical and dramaturgical analysis as well as interviews with artistic contributors, health workers and activists, I argue for the significance of The Dying Kiss and Student Zhao Ping as embodiments of government-fueled popular perceptions of HIV and AIDS in China at the start of the twenty-first century. Despite their short runs, these productions established an important precedent for theatre to address stigma and to affect governmental policy and even China's international standing as a leader in the global effort to address the epidemic.",

The need for such goals becomes clear as one considers the cultivation of stigma over the preceding decades. The trajectory of the AIDS epidemic in China is often divided into three stages (Shao 2001; Huang 2013) . Yiming Shao, Chief Expert on AIDS for the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, describes the 'introductory phase' as between roughly 1985 and 1988, when a popular perception of AIDS as a foreign disease was established. During this period, a small number of cases involving foreigners and Chinese citizens who had been traveling internationally was identified in coastal cities. Yanzhong Huang, Senior Fellow for Global Health for the Council on Foreign Relations, assesses the impact of these early cases on the perception of the growing crisis:",

Like their US counterparts, Chinese scientists and public health officials were initially convinced that HIV/AIDS spread mainly through homosexuality and promiscuity (Xinhua July 22, 1987) . Believing that both behaviors were 'illegal and contrary to Chinese morality' and therefore limited in China, senior health officials were confident that the AIDS epidemic was unlikely to occur within their borders. (2013: 86-87) The second, 'slow' or 'regional' phase of the epidemic, is attributed to the period between 1989 and 1994 and describes the steady increase in incidence and the appearance of the disease within border regions of the country. It is often marked by the identification of 146 HIV-positive intravenous drug users within China's southwest Yunnan province. HIV spread widely during this phase, reaching the majority of China's provinces and adding several hundred cases each year. The geographical site of the next turning point lies in the central Henan province, where the practice of selling blood for cash was widespread in the mid-1990s and HIV infection in the region was recorded at over 50 per cent of the population (Rosenthal Sept. 16, 2001a) . By 1995, HIV incidence climbed into the thousands.",

By 1998, HIV or AIDS cases were reported in all thirty-one provinces; China documented its first case of mother-to-child transmission, and sexual transmission of the disease had rapidly increased. Still, intravenous drug use and commercial blood and plasma donation accounted for the majority of transmissions during this phase, at 43.9 per cent and 24.1 per cent of the estimated number of HIV infections, respectively (China Ministry of Health 2004). The government estimates that in just four years, between 1999 and 2003, the number of people living in China with HIV increased from 500,000 to 840,000 (Thompson 2005: 4) . During this pivotal period in the first years of the new millennium, theatre artists directly engaged with new governmental policies, cultural identity, and social realities for people living with HIV or AIDS. Their productions serve as time capsules of a radical shift in the nation's response to the epidemic.",

The changes occurred quickly; in 1999, a short public-service announcement promoting condom use was pulled from television by officials who worried that it was 'too risqu\u00e9', but only two years later safer sex was openly discussed on the radio. Even with more open public discussion, stigma remained and news coverage at the turn of the millennium still reinforced early perceptions of HIV and AIDS as a problem linked to foreigners; people living with HIV or AIDS featured on television had generally contracted HIV overseas and concealed their identity by wearing sunglasses or turning their backs to the camera (Rosenthal 5 December 2001b) . Social discrimination was widespread, manifest through well-documented isolation, the loss of resources and services, verbal stigma, secondary stigma endured by family members and fellow villagers, and even self-discriminating behaviour (Cao et al. 2006; Hardee et al. 2009 ).",

Finally, with by some estimates one million AIDS victims [sic] in Henan province alone, silence was no longer an option, and the country's leaders were scrambling to come up with policies to show that they had a plan. (Laslocky 2007) That year, a new administration headed by President Hu Jintao, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier and the then Health Minister Wu Yi put the implementation of evidence-based HIV policies high on the national agenda (Sun et al. 2010 ) and announced a new national AIDS control policy, 'Four Frees and One Care' (free treatment, free Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT), free Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMCT) and free schooling for AIDS orphans, as well as provision of social relief for HIV patients). 6 However, such high-level policy making could not in and of itself prompt deep cultural change; after a photo of President Hu Jintao shaking hands with a person living with HIV was published, the man's daughter was expelled from school because of her father's serostatus (Wan 2014) . The impression of government leadership was important, however, and two plays at high-profile state theatres captured this dramatic shift in policy and served as a tool for prevention, stigma reduction and national image preservation.",

While this description is not quite accurate, 8 the production remains remarkable for its full-length treatment of the emotional experience of a Chinese person living with HIV and the embodiment of popular conceptions of HIV and AIDS. The play, written by Li Rong and Li Shengying and directed by Terence Chang, is based on actual events that were documented by journalist Tu Qiao in a monthly newspaper column and her subsequent book entitled A Century's Sorrows (2000) . It depicts the development of a trusting relationship between the journalist and Xiao Lu, a person living with HIV. The Dying Kiss is a zhuxuanlu, or main melody play, one that reinforces government-supported values. Claire Conceison explores the complexity of the 'main melody' campaign in Chinese spoken drama, describing a 'complicated dialectic with which the government was able to exert control over theatre workers while at the same time theatre workers were able to manipulate this control to their own advantage' (1994). These nuances are captured within The Dying Kiss ( Fig. 9.1) .",

            "text": "A nationalistic view of China is reinforced through heroic action, gender dynamics, and echoes of the long-promoted idea that HIV and AIDS perme-ated China's borders from abroad; much is made of the idea that Xiao Lu acquired HIV while in Thailand. The protagonist is Chinese, and national pride is evoked as transmission is portrayed through valiant action: Xiao Lu saved the life of a co-worker when an industrial sewing machine punctured her hand. When he gallantly freed her, it fell down upon him, puncturing his finger (21-22). The gender dynamics in this scenario are significant. As Alicia Leung argues (2003) , at the time of this production, China 'maintained a high degree of control over gender construction in order to legitimize its historical achievement of revolution and liberation, \u2026 This is derived from the core philosophy Confucianism in which human role relations are cultivated and developed within a male-centered world' (359). Therefore, Xiao Lu was upholding core, nationalist values when he contracted HIV (while overseas) and is thereby presented as one of the play's 'innocent victims'. What the play does manage to achieve is to show discrimination in medical care in China, from references to nurses hiding from people living with HIV (4) to Xiao Lu's decision to seek treatment overseas (9). The play contrasts the blame, social stigma and harsh treatment in China with compassion and care at a treatment centre in Thailand. 10 A late scene between Xiao Lu and his doctor serves as a direct critique of the national response while providing a vision of the future (that aligns with the new governmental policies): DIRECTOR CAI: I should apologize to you. \u2026 Do you remember how I distrusted and doubted you when we met for the first time?",

Drawing on this notion of blame and guilt associated with HIV and AIDS, the play provides an indictment of capitalism and perceived Western values while emphasising a commitment to core values of Chinese nationalism. Perhaps no scene documents this denunciation with greater clarity than a flashback to 'Heaven's Home', the treatment facility in Thailand where Xiao Lu receives care. Making a strong contrast with the hospitals of China, Xiao Lu describes his new surroundings to the audience: 'Here people are absolutely equal. Here, the doctors and nurses are kind hearted like angels. They gave me comfort and the newest treatment' (18). 11 There, Xiao Lu meets a monk, whose lived Buddhist values stand in sharp contrast to Xiao Lu's father's claimed Christianity. The monk's story serves as a critique of capitalist values, further emphasising that some-antinationalist-behaviours make people 'deserve' to have HIV. The monk used to be a government official with a 'loving, sweet wife, a smart son in high school'. He then grew jealous of friends who had more money and beautiful women and quit his government job to go into business: 'At that time, bosses were flying all over the sky, CEOs were prevailing on the land. When you yell boss or CEO on the street, nine out of ten people would turn around. It's worth nothing.' He made a lot of money (19). He reveals that he contracted HIV through infidelity and that, 'without knowing, I brought the disease to my wife' and his son has since cut off contact with him. Now, devoted to his spiritual life, he explains: I know I'm going to hell. Then why don't I use my last time to make friends and contribute to the society to build a better afterlife? \u2026 I will use Buddha's great wisdom to light your fire of life, use Buddha's endless power to ignite your courage to conquer the disease, and use Buddha's forgiveness to make clear that you need to cherish your every day, alive. (20) This emphasis on society instead of the individual reflects core Chinese cultural values. Varying degrees of guilt and innocence and a commitment to nationalism emerge through this story. If the monk had not succumbed to capitalist desires, he would still be working for the government with a happy wife and son in further embodiment of cultural values.",

As the educational discussion ends, the audience returns to the fictional world in which a police officer reports that neither the foreigners' claims of prostitution at the hotel nor Zhao Ping's claims of harassment are considered reliable and, following review of security footage, Zhao Ping is exonerated. Concluding the play, Zhao Ping, now attending an US university, exchanges emails with Xuedong through which she reveals that she does not have AIDS: she made that up as, indeed, she had made up her boyfriends. Her manipulation of authority figures leaves the audience questioning what might be trusted in their own relationships. Taken in its entirety, Student Zhao Ping is less a play about HIV and AIDS and more about generational conflict and gender construction, but this improvised scene, broken out of the fictional narrative, serves an important purpose: ensuring direct, frank conversation about HIV with the audience.

(cited in Wong 2005) This emphasis on sexuality and individuality may appear markedly progressive and, certainly, compared to the traditional conservative morality in The Dying Kiss, it is. However, the play was sponsored by Gobon Guilin Latex, the foremost condom manufacturer in China (see Global Business 2005; Zou et al. 2012) , which promoted its brand not only by providing condoms for the audience in a gift bag along with informational brochures, but for conspicuous product placement within the play's final moments: XUEDONG: I should not preach to the audiences, but people should not have a promiscuous life. ZHAO PING: If you can't do that, I think, at least be safe. XUEDONG: The \"yezhanpai\" is pretty good EVERYONE: We should use \"yezhanpai\" produced by Guilin Gaobang. (Tian 2005b: 17) Such a corporation would have a financial interest in promoting (safe) sexual freedom, partnering theatre and industry in efforts to contain the epidemic. Furthermore, the market was auspicious: with the increased awareness and action concerning HIV by the government and in the popular media, condom sales were increasing dramatically ('Global Business' 2005) . While promoting discussion of HIV, the play was also promoting a new ideology concerning sexual freedom.",

When Tian sought official approval of the script from the Cultural Bureau in Beijing prior to production, she was told that, while the subject of HIV was important, the script's sexual content was a problem. Tian was flabbergasted that she had been commissioned to write a play about AIDS for an increasingly sexually active generation but was not to address sex, a potent means of HIV transmission. She said: 'There's no way we could present this story to this generation without talking about sex' (2005a). She sought and found a loophole in the approval system. During my interview with her, she emphasised that this was a time of significant cultural reform; 'there was a socialist system for performance approval and a new, special socialism category' through which the play was finally approved (Tian 2005a) .",

Indeed, in order to torment her lover, Zhao Ping plays off the cultural imagination by telling Xuedong that she may have contracted HIV from her foreign boyfriend. Despite the progressive depiction of Zhao Ping's sexuality, the play presents the police as a conservative moral authority. While they conclude that Zhao Ping had not been engaging in prostitution and so should not face punitive actions from the university, therein lies the condemnation of sex workers. Similarly, Zhao Ping had lied about having a foreign lover, suggesting that her own serostatus might be different if in fact she had had a foreign lover.",

The Dying Kiss and Student Zhao Ping reflected the government's evolving stance concerning the virus. These plays protected the honour of Chinese national identity by portraying the disease as something entering Chinese society from outside the country's borders. The plays addressed in this study mark policy change, reflecting experiences that capture a society transitioning from denial to confrontation at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Since the time these plays were produced few theatrical productions in China have approached the topic of HIV and AIDS explicitly, while television and feature films continue to offer representation. 12 However, stigma endures (Kazar and Wang 2014) and it remains to be seen how the performing arts in China might productively intervene.",

The Dying Kiss was performed at the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center 19-21 March 2003; Student Zhao Ping ran from 29 April-15 May 2005 at Beijing's People's Art Theatre, 16-26 June 2005 at the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center, and was remounted 17-25 September 2005 in Beijing. 2. Noting that they generally follow Confucian theories, Bo Zhu synthesised numerous studies to identify the following seven core Chinese cultural values: past-time orientation, respect for hierarchy, interdependence, group orientation, face, modesty and harmony with others (2008: 34-38). Furthermore, Gilbert Rozman identified an intense national identity discourse in China, outlining the following six dimensions of national identity: (1) ideological-socialism, Confucianism and anti-Imperalism; (2) temporal-Chinese narratives emphasise the nation's history, including a stress on the nation's former humiliations; (3) sectoral-China stands at the centre of a vibrant Eastern civilisation, which stands opposite a West in decline; (4) vertical-cohesion under Communist Party leadership; (5) horizontal-regionalism as a means to achieve integration; (6) intensityrhetorical assertion of top-down Chinese narratives (often demonising other nations) (Rozman 2011). 3. Pu was appointed to the position by the Ministry of Health in 2010, the first person to play such a role in China's public health history. See Johanna Hood's essay 'Celebrity Philanthropy in China: The Political Critique of Pu Cunxin's AIDS Heroism' (2015) for an overview of Pu's responsibilities in relationship to his celebrity status. 4. The China Youth Fund for the Prevention of AIDS, a non-profit nongovernmental organisation, was cofounded by the China Youth Development Foundation, China Youth Daily and Guilin Latex Factory (Gao Bang Latex Industry). 5. The film, the first in China to focus on issues relating to HIV, was produced by the China National Communication and Education Center for Family Planning (CNCECFP) with assistance from the State Family Planning Commission (SFPC) (State Council 2001). 6. Yiming Shao argues that this new, aggressive HIV and AIDS policy grew from the internationally public mishandling of the SARS epidemic in China. Shao explains, 'the SARS epidemic in 2003 was a wake-up call for the Chinese government and society as a whole. It has now been widely recognized that public health is not merely a medical issue but rather a security issues, affecting economic growth and social stability' (2006, n.p.). 7. This chapter refers to an unpublished script for The Dying Kiss as it was used in production in 2003. The play was revised and later published as 'I Have a Date with AIDS' in a collection of Li Rong's work in 2008 with several plot changes, most notably that Xu Qian's friend Wa Wa is now her fianc\u00e9 Meng Zong. Meng Zong fears that Xu Qian will contract HIV from exposure to Xiao Lu through their interviews, and that he will in turn contract the virus from Xu Qian. 8. Earlier Chinese plays addressing HIV and AIDS in China include Mou Sen's 1994 Related to AIDS (see Wetmore et al. 2014: 121). Also during this period, in 2003, the AIDS Performance Group associated with the Gongmin Charitable Home in Gongmin, wrote and performed short theatre pieces dramatizing the experiences of its members, all people living with HIV. This included Let's All Spread the Word Together, which was brought to Beijing by government officials to perform-this time with celebrities in minor roles-as propaganda before UN delegates (People's Daily 2004; Pu 2005). 9. My gratitude to the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center for providing the unpublished scripts of these plays. Translations are courtesy of Shuhan Zhang with assistance from Cleo Han. 10. A history of discrimination toward people living with HIV by doctors and nurses in China is documented by Wan Yanhai et al. (2010). 11. Thailand has a record of providing compassionate care to people living",
