The distribution of these stochastic simulations captures the range of observed cases well.

Our median estimate of the effective reproductive number, Re-equivalent to the basic reproductive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic-is 2.38 (95% CI: 2.04\u22122.77), indicating a high capacity for sustained transmission of COVID-19 (Table 1 and Fig. 1D ).

Estimates of both the latency and infectious periods were similar to those made for 10-23 January; however, \u03b1, \u03b2, and Re all shifted considerably.
