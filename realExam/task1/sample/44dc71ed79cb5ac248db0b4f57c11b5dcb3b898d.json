Methods: The consecutive records of 93 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. A series of chest CT findings and clinical data were collected and analyzed. The serial chest CT scans were scored on a semiquantitative basis according to the extent of pulmonary abnormalities. Chest CT scores in different periods (0 -5 days, 6 -10 days, 11 -15 days, 16 -20 days, and > 20 days) since symptom onset were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors, and the temporal trend of the radiographic-clinical features was analyzed. Results: The final cohort consisted of 93 patients: 68 survivors and 25 nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors were significantly older than survivors. For both survivors and nonsurvivors, the chest CT scores were not different in the first period (0 -5 days) but diverged afterwards. The mortality rate of COVID-19 monotonously increased with chest CT scores, which positively correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil percentage, D-dimer level, lactate dehydrogenase level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count. Conclusions: Chest CT scores correlate well with risk factors for mortality over periods, thus they may be used as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19. While higher chest CT scores are associated with a higher mortality rate, CT images taken at least 6 days since symptom onset may contain more prognostic information than images taken at an earlier period.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In December 2019, a cluster of patients with acute respiratory disease recognized as coronavirus disease 2019 was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] .
