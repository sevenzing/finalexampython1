The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the causative pathogen of COVID-19, has had global public health and economic consequences. The molecular mechanism(s) underlying the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 remain(s) elusive. Therefore, we must follow a pragmatic and stepwise path to determine the specific target cell subsets and factors that regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection to elucidate true targets for treatment. In a recent issue of Cell, Carly and co-workers 1 identified the cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in certain tissues. In addition, they found that IFN-\u03b1 enhanced the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in primary human upper airway basal cells. However, we know that IFN is cell-type-and host speciesspecific, indicating the need for more preclinical and clinical data to clarify the role of IFN in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.",

By comparing the RNA profile of different cell subsets from diverse tissues of non-human primate (NHP), human, and mouse, Carly and co-workers 1 found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are both enriched within epithelial cells, especially type II pneumocytes in the lung, absorptive enterocytes in the intestine, as well as goblet secretory cells in the nasal and sinus tissue. The detection of possible target cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the lung, nasal and sinus tissues, and the intestine is consistent with the clinical observation that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, and stool samples. Validation of cell types infected by SARS-CoV-2 would provide a theoretical basis for selecting a cell model to evaluate newly developed COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.",

Therefore, the authors then investigated whether IFNs might also regulate ACE2 expression levels in specific target cell subsets.

On the one hand, ACE2 can act as a tissue-protective component during severe acute lung injury induced by other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and HCoV-OC43. 3 Therefore, induction of ACE2 expression would not be a trait exclusive to SARS-CoV-2 and it is still elusive whether increasing expression of ACE2 is more protective or harmful in vivo. On the other hand, Kwok-Yung and co-workers 4 reported that \"SARS-CoV-2 did not significantly induce types I, II, or III interferons in the infected human lung tissues,\" 4 indicating that ACE2 might not be upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 since IFN is rarely induced. Thus, at this point, whether IFN plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 needs more clinical and experimental investigation.",

It has been reported that pretreatment with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 significantly reduced virus titer in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques. 5 These findings suggest that IFN has been considered as a promising drug candidate for SARS-CoV-2. The study of Carly and co-workers 1 has raised concerns about the safety of using IFN in the clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2, but no clear conclusion was drawn. First, this study mainly focused on type I IFNs (IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2) and type II IFNs (IFN\u03b3), whereas type III IFNs (IFN\u03bb) were not investigated. Second, as the author stated, the scRNA-seq datasets used in this study were not specifically designed to understand how IFN functions in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Since the induction of ACE2 expression by IFN is cell-type-specific, it still cannot be concluded that cell subsets in which IFN upregulates ACE2 are the same as those targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Finally, as the author stated in a news report, \"It's hard to make any broad conclusions about the role of interferon against this virus. It's a balance between host restriction, tissue tolerance, and viral enhancement mechanisms of IFN.\"",

Second, ACE2 expression was not driven by IFN in a mouse model, highlighting the importance of careful selection of in vivo models for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.
