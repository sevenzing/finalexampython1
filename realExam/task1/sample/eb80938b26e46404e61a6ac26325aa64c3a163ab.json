            "text": "Objective Social isolation and loneliness are common concerns in older adults. While social isolation is often conceptualized as the objective state of minimal social contact and integration, loneliness is the negative feeling accompanying perceived social isolation (1) . Studies estimate that a range of 33-72% older adults report feelings of loneliness and that a larger proportion of these individuals live in a residential home (2, 3, 4, 5) . Loneliness is associated with negative health outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality (6) . Moreover, there are significant mental health consequences of loneliness, including cognitive decline (3, 7) and symptoms of depression and anxiety (8, 9) . To date, activities offered in nursing home settings to address social isolation (e.g. games, outings) appear to have limited benefit (10) . Although controversial and in its infancy, some data suggests the utility of socially assistive robotics to address social isolation in nursing home settings where the availability of healthcare providers may be less than optimal (11) .",

Subsequently, nursing home recreation directors were contacted. Recreation directors identified eligible seniors interested in participation. In general, older individuals were approached if they were Englishspeaking and able to participate meaningfully in a telephone program. Volunteers recognized common challenges experienced by many of these older adults, including feelings of restlessness and anxiety as isolation continues, and fearfulness as COVID-19 enters nursing home facilities. In addition, many nursing home residents experienced social isolation before the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges are exacerbated by a lack of technology (e.g. limited computer and internet access to communicate with loved ones), as well as visual and hearing impairments. These factors similarly complicated phone calls with student volunteers: For example, hearing impairments and invalid landline telephone numbers impeded completion of initial phone calls. However, facilitation by recreation directors helped resolve COVID-19 Telephone Outreach 6 these technical issues, allowing volunteers to effectively connect with the nursing home residents.",
