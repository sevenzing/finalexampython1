Instead of detecting the pulse wave via pressure sensors, bioimpedance measurements can be performed to acquire minuscule changes in conductivity of the tissue, caused by the pulse wave. This work presents a microcontroller based bioimpedance measurement system, which has the capability to acquire impedance measurements from up to four independent channels simultaneously. By combining a problem-specific analog measurement circuit with a 24 bits ADC, the system is capable of acquiring 1000 impedances per second with a signal to noise ratio in a range from 92 dB to 96 dB. For data storage and analysis the digitized data are sent via USB to a host PC. A graphical user interface filters and plots the data of all channels in real-time. The performance of the system regarding measuring constant impedances, as well as impedance changes over time is demonstrated. Two different applications for pulse wave analysis via multi-channel bioimpedance measurements are presented. Additionally, first measurement results from a human subject are shown to demonstrate the system's applicability of analyzing the pulse wave morphology as well as the aortic pulse wave velocity.",

In the past, especially tonometric or oscillometric methods were used to detect the pressure pulse waves, in the arteries, which are generated by the pumping of the heart [4]- [7] . The most significant parameters are the pulse wave velocity (PWV) inside the aorta and the morphology change of the pulse wave Digital Object Identifier xx.xxxx/xxxxxx inside the aorta [8] - [12] . Since most non-invasive techniques are not able to detect the pulse wave directly at the aortic arch or at the end of the aorta, other measurement setups were developed to circumvent this problem. These measurement setups detect the pulse wave at other positions of the human body, like at the extremities, mostly using cuff-based pressure measurements. Afterwards, transfer functions are used to estimate the pressure conditions inside the aorta [5] , [13] . Instead of performing pressure measurements, the pulse wave can also be acquired by bioimpedance measurements, called impedance plethysmography [14] - [17] . This technique is based on the fact, that blood has a higher conductivity than other tissue, such as fat or muscle, in the frequency range between 10 kHz and 1 MHz [17] . Since the volume of blood in the arteries increases, when the arriving pressure pulse wave widens the arteries, the bioimpedance magnitude decreases within an area under test. The advantage of this noninvasive technique is that arteries, even deep under the skin surface, can be analyzed. Additionally, the subject's discomfort, caused by sensors pressed onto the skin above the arteries, is replaced by more comfortable electrodes.",

At the forearms, the positive electrodes are positioned at the crook of the arms and the negative electrodes are attached to the wrists, which results in a distance of 25 cm between the voltage electrodes. The electrode positions at the legs are the hollows of the knees (negative electrodes) and the ankle joints (positive electrodes). This setup leads to a distance of 35 cm between the voltage electrodes. The four bioimpedances are measured synchronously on both fore arms and both lower legs, using all four current sources and voltage measurement channels. The 2 mA excitation currents have a frequency of 50 kHz and the ADC channels digitize with a sample rate of 1 kSPS. For electrical safety purposes a medical power supply (MPU31-102, SINPRO Electronics, Pingtung City, TW) is used and the USB port is isolated (USB-GT-MED-D, Meilhaus Electronic, Alling, DE). The used standard silver chloride electrodes (Kendall H92SG, Covidien, Dublin, IE) are connected via coaxial cables to the measurement device. The measurement data are acquired for 20 seconds. Afterwards, the signals are low pass (f cut-off = 8 Hz) and high pass (f cut-off = 0.5 Hz,) filtered using 1 st order zero-phase IIR filters to prevent ringing artefacts.

Since it is difficult to detect the exact starting time of the pulse wave at the heart and the arrival time of the wave at the end of the aorta by using common techniques, the pulse wave is usually acquired at other positions. These positions can be the arteria carotis (Compilor, Alam Medical, Saint Quentin Fallavier, FR), the radial artery (SphygmoCor CVMS, AtCor Medical, Itasca, IL, US) or the brachial artery (Arteriograph, TensioMed, Budapest, HU; SphygmoCor XCEL PWA, AtCor Medical, Itasca, IL, US) [28] . Instead of determining the PWV by measuring the transient time of the pulse wave between two different positions simultaneously, most of these devices execute just a single-point measurement. Afterwards, the PWV inside the aorta is estimated with the help of transfer functions. Depending on the measurement setup and the implemented algorithms, the resulting values of PWV can vary widely [28] .",

Therefore, the four electrodes are positioned horizontally between the 2 nd and the 3 rd ribs with a distance of 10 cm between the voltage electrodes. Z RL , acquired at the upper part of the right leg (RL), contains the information about the pulse arrival time close to the end of the aorta. The positive electrodes are positioned at the popliteal fossa and the negative electrodes are positioned at the groin. No additional skin preparation has been performed.

Averaging of the time delays of the pulse wave peaks, as indicated with orange and purple markers, over 24 pulse waves, leads to a mean pulse transient time (PTT) of approximately 78 ms. Assuming a measured distance ( x) of 60 cm, between the aortic arch and the measurement position at the right leg results in a mean pulse wave velocity of about 7.7 m/s, as shown in the following formula. This result is surely influenced by the portion of the leg arteries and the spot of the electrodes, but it can be assumed that the determination and elimination of this influence is more reliable than the models used in conventional methods. An approach to minimize the influence of the leg arteries could be the additional determination of the PVW within the leg. Therefore, a third bioimpedance measurement could be performed at a lower leg position. The only remaining unknowns would be the exact lengths of the aorta and of the section between the aorta and the first impedance measurement at the leg. However, this unknown value influences the results of conventional methods, as well [28] .",
