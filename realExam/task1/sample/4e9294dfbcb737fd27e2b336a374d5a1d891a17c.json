We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. Materials and Methods: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26-75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. Results: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R range , 0.36-0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001-0.04). Conclusions: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.",

            "text": "I n late December 2019, Wuhan, China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, 1,2 which was newly named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 3 The disease is spreading at a striking speed. In our institution, the first case was discovered in late December 2019; until February 12, 2020, the confirmed cases in China have exceeded 45,000 in such a short period. Of these, approximately 34,000 were from Hubei province. 4 More and more cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia have also been reported worldwide. The emerging and urgent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has raised intense attention globally. 5 The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes viruses that cause diseases ranging from the common influenza to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 1 According to the epidemiological investigation, these viruses are highly infectious and can spread rapidly in humans. 6 The main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets, as well as physical contact. Current estimates are that the incubation period is generally 3 to 7 days, and up to 14 days. 7 People are generally susceptible. The elderly and those with underlying diseases are more seriously ill after infection. 8 Children and infants can also be infected. The SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and may cause severe illness similar clinically to SARS. 9 Early disease progression can be rapid, and sometimes results in severe respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit admission (26%-32%), and death (4.3%-15%). 2, 8, 10 The Chinese health authorities did immediate investigations and implemented important measures to characterize this novel pneumonia and restrict its prevalence. Many cities in Hubei province were sealed off from all outside contact to stop the spread of the plague. Meanwhile, efficient diagnosis and treatment procedures were developed. 11 Symptoms resulting from COVID-19 infection in the prodromal phase include fever, dry cough, and malaise, which are nonspecific. 2, 8, 10 Some patients may not even have obvious symptoms. Therefore, chest computed tomography (CT), in particular high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), represents valuable tools identifying patients with COVID-19 infections in an early stage when clinical symptoms may be unspecific or sparse. [12] [13] [14] For every suspected patient, chest CT is indispensable for definitive diagnosis and reexamination. According to the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, chest radiography and CTwere the major diagnostic components when SARS was prevalent. 15 The clinical and imaging manifestations in the early stage of COVID-19 are particularly important. They can be used to confirm the diagnosis, judge the changes in severity, adjust the treatment plan, and infer the prognosis. The purpose of our study was to characterize the clinical and HRCT features in patients with COVID-19 infection retrospectively, and to facilitate early identification and early isolation. We also aimed to explore the change in HRCT on a short-term follow-up and whether there was a connection between clinical and imaging features in the early stage of the illness.",

Ground glass opacity was defined as increased lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, and consolidation was defined as opacification in which the underlying vasculature was obscured. 16, 17 Each lobe of the lung was assessed for opacifications, and the lesion size was graded as 0 (none), 1 (diameter, <1 cm), 2 (diameter, 1 to <3 cm), 3 (diameter, 3 cm to <50% of the lobe), or 4 (50%-100% of the lobe). 18 All 5 lobar scores were summed to calculate the overall score for the severity of opacifications.

Some investigations, 14, 16, 20 including the current one, have shown some frequently encountered HRCT findings, some of which were similar with other viral pneumonias, including specifically SARS, MERS, and H7N9 pneumonia. 18, 21, 22 In terms of distribution, the lower lobes are preferentially Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or n (%). affected, especially the left lower lobe in our study group (34/42 cases in the initial onset stages). Pulmonary lesions were most commonly in the subpleural, peribronchovascular area, or distributed diffusively. In the early stages, single or multiple small ground glass infiltration, consolidation, and interstitial thickening could be seen. As the disease progressed, severe cases had more consolidation and air bronchograms in the relevant lobes. The diffuse lesions, shown as \"white lungs,\" were seen in the most severely affected patients. Fibrous stripes could be seen during the remission stage. The distribution manners, together with the GGOs, are very characteristic and impressive. Before clinical treatments, the sum score of opacification size was positively correlated with the days from illness onset to initial CT. Therefore, cautious attention to symptoms and application of CT examination, as soon as possible, are helpful for early detection of COVID-19 infection and standardized treatment and isolation. Especially for those who were unaware of the concealed discomfort, HRCT can assist clinicians and antiepidemic workers with finding potentially infectious patients. Because of the individualized treatments and individual heterogeneity, the same correlation was not significant after admission to the hospital. However, the total opacification severity score was still increasing with a relatively slower speed than that before treatments.",

This may be related to the immunopathological basis that the coronaviruses interact with and modify the host intracellular environment during infection for the benefit of quickly replicating. The majority of studies have suggested that a dysregulated/exuberant innate response is the leading contributor to coronavirus-mediated pathology. 23 Many cytokines or chemokines are involved in the immune storm after coronavirus infection. 24 Although with meticulous treatments, it takes a time for the immune response to build and produce antibodies to suppress virus replication. As a result, it is of great importance to control the progression in the first 2 weeks from illness onset with utmost effort.",

These findings indicate that high fever on initial presentation is a potential risk factor of adverse CT outcomes over a short-term follow-up; however, the limited cases in this study should be noted. Moreover, several initial CT findings, including sum score and max score for opacification severity as well as area of the max lesion in cross-section, were inversely associated with \u0394Sum. A possible explanation for these results may be that patients with relatively serious pulmonary opacities on initial CT have already progressed and then there was a short plateau stage or a gradual decrease trend in abnormalities. 14, 29 This study has some limitations. First, this is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to the hospital. At the time of data collection, nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of COVID- 19 had not yet been available for all the suspected patients, and the detection rate of real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid tests was not high. 12, 13 Besides, we only included hospitalized patients with followup CT examinations to ensure more information on clinical and CT characteristics. Possible selection bias should be noted, and further study of a larger cohort is required to obtain a definitive answer. Second, the quantitative and semiquantitative methods for measuring the pulmonary lesions may have certain subjectivity. Third, the susceptibility of COVID-19 was considered (initially and incorrectly) to be very low among infants, children, and adolescents, so we did not retrospectively study these groups. More effort should be made to identify the clinical and imaging features in these groups in future studies.",
