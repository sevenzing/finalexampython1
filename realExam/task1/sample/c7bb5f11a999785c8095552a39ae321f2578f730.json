It has been shown that infection-related morbidity and mortality is unacceptably high among these patients, in particular during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, which is the most important single risk factor for bacterial and fungal infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 488, "end": 491, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Early studies have shown that the incidence of microbiologically documented infections in febrile neutropenic cancer patients approached 100% in patients untreated for up to 3 weeks.1 In response to the poor outcome observed in the majority of these patients, early use of empirical antibacterial and antimycotic therapy has evolved and dramatically decreased mortality. 2 The characterization and purification of hematopoietic growth-factors, a class of cytokines that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and function of hematopoietic cells, offered the promise of a new dimension for supportive care in the cancer patient. Among them, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) regulates the production of the neutrophil lineage. 3 The administration of G-CSF to humans results in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophils, mainly because of a reduced transit time from stem cell to mature neutrophils. In addition, G-CSF enhances phagocyte function, such as superoxide generation and fungicidal activity. Numerous studies have evaluated the prophylactic use of G-CSF in both pediatric and adult patients undergoing therapy for cancer.4,5 Unfortunately, the results of the studies performed in this setting are conflicting, which is mainly due to differences in study design and size of patient population analyzed, differences in the definition of low and high risk patients, and differences in clinical endpoints. Whereas most studies demonstrated that G-CSF significantly shortens the time of neutropenia, the effect of the administration of the costly hematopoietic growth factor on the incidence of febrile neutropenia, decrease in antiobiotic usage, decrease in hospitalization, influence in the rate of complete remission, and, most importantly, the improvement of disease-free survival are less clear and depend on a number of clinical factors. Systematic review of the literature suggested that the prophylactic use of G-CSF should be reserved for patients with a high incidence of febrile neutropenia, e.g., patients with an expected incidence of fever and neutropenia 40%, which is the fact for children with high-risk ALL or B-cell NHL. 6 In contrast to patients with lymphoblastic leukemia and solid tumors, there was much concern about the use of G-CSF in patients with AML, since most of myeloid leukemia cells express receptors for the growth factor, and G-CSF has been shown to induce proliferation of leukemic blasts in vitro.7 However, clinical studies in adult patients have not shown harm from growth factor administration when given after completion of induction chemotherapy for AML. In addition, most studies demonstrated that the addition of G-CSF resulted in a decreased time of neutrophil recovery and in a reduction of duration of hospitalization and antibiotic use. The administration of G-CSF, however, did not improve complete remission rate, and except for two smaller studies, had no effect on patient survival. Therefore, in the recommendations by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, it is stated that G-CSF use can be considered in this setting if benefits in terms of possible shortening of hospitalization outweigh the costs of G-CSF use. 6 In contrast to adult patients, there are limited data in the pediatric population regarding the use of G-CSF in patients with AML. One non-randomized study, which compared two consecutive pediatric patient populations with AML treated according to the clinical trial CCG-2891, showed that the administration of G-CSF significantly shortened the time of neutropenia and also reduced the hospital stay.8 In contrast, no effect of the growth factor on the incidence of grades 3 and 4 toxicities, on induction remission rates and overall-survival and event-free survival was seen.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 371, "end": 372, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 740, "end": 741, "text": "3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2171, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3205, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "References"}, {"text": "The recently closed multicenter clinical trial AML-BFM 98 prospectively evaluated the impact of G-CSF on hematopoetic recovery, infectious complications and five-year event-free survival in pediatric patients with AML.

Hundred-fifty-eight children were randomized to receive G-CSF, and 169 patients not to receive G-CSF.

First results from the recently initiated Research on Adverse Drug events And Reports (RADAR) project in the postmarketing setting have demonstrated serious ADRs of mAbs administered in hematologic malignancies which occur with an incidence rate from 1 in 170-200 patients (rituximab: severe infusion reactions) up to 1 in 3-7 patients (gemtuzumab: sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) [43, 44] . These findings underscore the need for continued vigilance and better postmarketing surveillance, especially for new drugs such as mAbs passing through fast track or accelerated approval processes, in order to improve patient safety. In the last decade, inhibition of signal transduction pathways by small molecule inhibitors has emerged as a very promising approach for the treatment of solid and hematopoietic malignancies. This inhibition might either be directed against the activity of the transmembrane or cytoplasmic receptor itself or against signalling molecules that act downstream in response to receptor stimulation and regulate growth and apoptosis. Products of K-RAS, N-RAS and H-RAS are small-molecule membranebound guanine nucleotide binding proteins that play a crucial role in a number of signal transduction pathways and regulate many cellular functions such as proliferation and differentiation. Inhibition of RAS family proteins represents a very promising therapeutic approach since members of this family of small GTP hydrolases might be either activated by stimulated or mutated tyrosine kinases or carry mutations in hot spot regions themselves.1,2 RAS mutations usually detected in patients with a variety of different malignancies occur at codons 12, 13 or 61. These positions are critical for regulation of RAS activity and also affected in experimentally induced tumors of mice or rats. 3 The mutated RAS is still able to form complexes with GTPase activating proteins, but has lost its ability to hydrolyse bound GTP. That leads to spontaneous activation of downstream effectors such as RAF and PI-3-kinase. In cell culture models, activating RAS mutations induce loss of contact inhibition, substrateindependent growth and enhanced DNA synthesis rate. In adult de novo AML, activating point mutations of N-RAS have been detected in 20% to 30%, so that farnesyltransferase inhibitors that directly inhibit RAS function by disturbing its proper posttranslational processing and membrane binding are subject of current clinical testing. The non-peptidomimetic competitive farnesyltransferase inhibitor R115777 (tipifarnib, Zarnestra) has been studied across a wide range of different malignancies, e.g. in patients with solid tumors or hematopoietic neoplasia of myeloid origin (myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia).

Remarkable achievements in improving the cure rate for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia have occurred over the past four decades. Today close to 80% of children are alive without disease many years after completing therapy. Advances in cancer genetics have uncovered some of the acquired genetic mutations that are associated with leukemia cells but many steps in malignant transformation remain obscure. The ability to analyze globally the level of RNA transcripts within tumor cells (gene expression or microarray profiling) has provided an opportunity to explore cancer pathogenesis in greater detail. Gene expression profiles have been identified that define blast phenotype, genotype and clinical behavior. The study of blasts at relapse compared to initial diagnosis has identified pathways that might serve as novel therapeutic targets and has provided insights into the cellular origin of clones observed at relapse. Advances in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) serve as a paradigm to improve outcome for all human cancers. However new challenges now face clinicians. Some children are being over-treated so that others can benefit from intensified therapy. In addition, 20% of patients suffer a relapse and their outcome is dismal. To overcome such obstacles biological insights into the pathogenesis of childhood ALL are needed. Acute leukemias, like other cancers, are a group of somatically-acquired, clonal genetic disorders that emanate from a single cell. In the case of childhood ALL these genetic lesions are well characterized, such as gains and/or losses of whole chromosomes, as well as translocations. These cytogenetic findings provide significant prognostic information and are now used routinely to stratify patients into treatment protocols that differ in intensity, thus balancing efficacy and toxicity. For example, patients with adverse cytogenetic findings such as extreme hypodiploidy (DNA index <0.81 or <44 chromosomes), MLL translocations or the t(9:22) generally receive more intensive treatment than those with favorable cytogenetics such as hyperdiploidy with trisomies 4, 10 and 17 and the TEL-AML1 fusion..", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Patients Not Considered Fit for Intensive Chemotherapy"}, {"text": "In spite of these associations, the underlying biology that drives malignant transformation and drug sensitivity remains unknown.

Similar observations were reported from a hMRP8-AML1-ETO transgenic mouse model, which developed AML as well as T-ALL/lymphoma only after ENU mutagenesis [7] , and from a murine bone marrow transplantation model inducing constitutive expression of AML1-ETO in hematopoietic progenitor cells by retroviral gene transfer [8] .

The first experimental hint, that constitutively activated RTK's can collaborate with AML1-ETO came from a murine leukemia model, which demonstrated that coexpression of ETV6-PDGFR, causing already by itself a lethal myeloproliferative syndrome in transplanted mice, with AML1-ETO resulted in AML [10] . In addition, the model of genetic collaboration is now strongly supported by data based on the molecular characterization of AML1-ETO or other 'core binding factor' (CBF) leukemias in patients. It was shown that genetic lesions affecting transcriptional regulators such as AML1-ETO, HOX fusion genes or PML-RAR frequently occur together with activating mutations of RTKs. In contrast, genetic lesions of the same category (e.g. AML1-ETO with Hox fusion genes or FLT3-LM with c-KIT mutations) rarely occur together [11] . These observations have favoured a model, in which collaboration of two groups of genetic alterations, one affecting transcriptional regulation and hematopoietic differentiation, the other altering signal transduction cascades associated with cell proliferation, are necessary for the initiation of leukemia [12] . We recently reported on a series of 135 adult patients with AML1-ETO positive AML, analyzed for the additional occurrence of activating mutations involving signal transduction pathways (FLT3-LM, FLT3D835, KITD816, NRAS codon 12/13/61) or concurrent MLL partial tandem duplicaton (PTD). Of note, almost one third of all AML1-ETO positive patients had mutations affecting RTK's or NRAS, whereas none showed the MLL-PTD [13] . These findings were confirmed by other reports describing KIT and RAS mutations in 70% of pediatric CBF leukemias in a series of 150 patients [14] or c-KIT mutations in 48% of patients [15] . Recently it was shown that additional activating mutations of RTK's such as c-KIT clearly change the clinical outcome in patients with AML1-ETO positive AML with a significantly shortened overall and event free survival: patients with AML1-ETO and additional c-KIT D816 mutations had an overall survival of 304 versus 1836 days (p=0.006) and an event free survival of 244 versus 744 days (p=0.0027) [16] (Fig. 1 ). The first functional evidence, that AML1-ETO collaborates with an activated RTK recurrently found in patients with AML1-ETO positive leukemia, was recently provided in a murine bone marrow (BM) transplantation model [13] : when mice were transplanted with BM cells retrovirally expressing AML1-ETO or FLT3-LM, none of the animals developed a disease. However, all the animals, which engrafted with bone marrow cells co-expressing both cDNA's developed transplantable acute leukemia (Fig. 2) .

But in the case of the AML1-ETO positive leukemia collaboration of the fusion gene with activating RTK's would provide a rationale to combine chemotherapy with novel drugs targeting RTKs and downstream effectors, which have been developed and are currently tested in several clinical trials. At the moment at least four FLT3 inhibitors are in clinical trials and others are at various stages of development [17] . In the murine AML1-ETO/FLT3-LM leukemia model, AML1-ETO was not able to collaborate with a kinase dead FLT3-LM mutant and treatment with the FLT3 -inhibitor PKC412 reduced the oncogenic collaboration of AML1-ETO and FLT3-LM by 60%, pointing to a potential clinical activity of these drugs in Figure 1 : Overall survival of patients with AML1-ETO with or without c-KIT D816 mutation [16] the subset of AML1-ETO positive leukemias harboring additional RTK mutations [13] .

Increased numbers microvessels have been detected on histological sections of bone marrow biopsies of AML patients as compared to those with reactive disorders. Besides increased provision of oxygen and nutritions, paracrine exchange of growth factors between AML blasts and endothelial cells is believed to contribute to the progression of AML [3] . The angiogenic growth factors are divided into endothelial specific and nonspecific factors. To the last class belong cytokines such as FGF or hepatocyte growth factors which have pleiotropic actions on various cell types. The VEGF family and the angiopoietins on the other hand are endothelial specific since their receptors are almost exclusively expressed on endothelial and immature hematopoietic cells [4, 5] . Both classes of receptors belong to the tyrosine kinase family [6] [7] [8] [9] .

Abstract: Genetic and molecular techniques have provided increasing insights into the biology of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These investigations showed that AML is not a homogeneous disease but a heterogeneous group of biologically different subentities. These subentities are currently primarily defined by cytogenetics by which three main subgroups can be discriminated: AML with balanced translocations, AML with unbalanced aberrations and AML without cytogenetically detectable aberrations. Within the latter group molecular alterations are identified in more than half of cases such as NPM mutations, FLT3 mutations, MLL duplications and mutations of CEBP-. The clinical meaning of these findings is illustrated by substantial differences in response to therapy and long term outcome. As demonstrated by the recent multicenter trial of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG) and other studies intensification of induction therapy may improve the results in distinct subtypes but fails to do so in others. Therefore, new strategies need to be explored which incorporate the knowledge about the biology of AML to develop biology adapted treatment strategies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 201, "text": "[2;6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 325, "end": 328, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 683, "end": 686, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1206, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Down syndrome"}, {"text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of disorders that arises from the malignant transformation of early hematopoietic precursor cells.

The doses of daunorubicin and etoposide used in the phase 3 trial therefore reflected considerations regarding observed and potential clinical efficacy and toxicity based on our analysis of outcomes among the 410 patients who were treated in the phase 1 trial. Based on pharmacologic considerations, the dose reductions of daunorubicin (56%) and etoposide (60%) in ADEP relative to ADE likely lead to similar serum levels of the Pgp substrates in the 2 treatment arms in the phase 3 trial. Cerebellar toxicity attributable to PSC and cardiotoxicity from the high doses of daunorubicin used in ADE have not been significant. The phase 3 trial in older patients was halted after 120 patients were randomized because of toxicity concerns, principally early death in the ADEP arm. Despite this, overall survival (OS) did not differ by treatment arm. There was also a suggestion that patients whose leukemic cells displayed PSCmediated drug efflux in vitro and received ADEP had a clinical benefit with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) as compared with those patients treated with ADE (5 vs. 14 months, p=0.07) [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2015, "end": 2018, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TAD TAD--HAM / HAM HAM / HAM--HAM TAD HAM TAD--HAM / HAM HAM / HAM--HAM HAM"}, {"text": "Encouraging findings with respect to prolongation of DFS and OS among patients < 45 years treated on CALGB 9621 stimulated interest in pursuing the phase 3 trial in patients < 60 years.

Invasive fungal infection is thought to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with leukaemia. Data from literature reviews suggests that among patients with invasive aspergillosis in about 43% the underlying disease is leukemia or lymphoma [1] . In these patients the case fatality rate is reported to be very high with 49%. However the true incidence and natural history of invasive fungal infections in patients with acute leukaemia is unknown. There are several reasons being responsible for this problem: 1. Diagnosis of invasive fungal infection has changed and improved very much during recent years. The advent of readily available high resolution pulmonary CT scanning has led to a large number of patients being identified as having probable invasive fungal infection [2] . In addition antigen assays and PCR for aspergillus species have improved our diagnostic sensitivity. Strict criteria for the definition of invasive fungal infections in the context of clinical trials have only recently been introduced [3] . 2. In clinical trials investigating treatment options in invasive fungal infections leukaemia is usually just one of several possible underlying diseases. For example in the voriconazole trial by Herbrecht et al only 43% of the patients had acute leukaemia [4] , whereas in the caspofungin trial by Walsh et al 73% of the patients had acute leukemia [5] . As it is not known what proportion of patients with acute leukaemia entered these trials, the true incidence and case fatality of invasive fungal infections in patients with leukaemia can not be calculated from these trials. 3 . In trials dealing with the treatment of leukaemia information on infectious complications often is incomplete. Thus mostly the total number of infections, and the treatment related mortality is reported, but no information is given on the specific diagnosis of the infection or on their fatality rate [6, 7] . Furthermore no reliable data are provided to show whether the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection meets accepted criteria. Thus it is difficult to precisely say how big the problem of invasive fungal infections in leukaemia really is. Although it is generally accepted that the problem is substantial, data on the true incidence and fatality rate of invasive fungal infections in leukaemia are incomplete. Abstract Much progress has been made in recent years in the treatment of patients with cancer. A new array of chemotherapeutic agents and biologicals has been introduced into treatment strategies leading to improved response and cure rates.

All 4 refractory cases eventually achieved remission with extended induction therapy. Postremission failures included hematological relapse in 5 cases, CNS relapse in 3, and lineage switch, secondary myelodysplasia, and death in remission in one case each. Notably, all three CNS relapses occurred within the first year of continuation treatment; because prophylactic cranial irradiation was scheduled at one year of continuous complete remission in our clinical trials in the 1990s, their CNS relapse would not have been prevented by irradiation even if they were treated in our prior studies. The overall treatment result is promising,: 4year event-free survival and overall survival rates (SE) are 92% (4.0%) and 96% (3%), respectively [34] . This improved result has eliminated the impact of many prognostic factors once associated with poor outcome, e.g., male sex and high initial leukocyte count. Besides the presence of Philadelphia chromosome, the only adverse prognostic factors consisted of positive minimal-residual-leukemia (>0.01%) at the end of 6-week remission induction for event-free survival, and age > 10 years at diagnosis for survival. Key words: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Cranial irradiation, Central-nervoussystem leukemia With the achievement of 5-year event-free survival rates of 80% or more in some contemporary clinical trials for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), recent effort has focused on optimal risk-directed therapy to avoid overor under-treatment. Because cranial irradiation can cause many acute and late complications, including second cancers, late neurocognitive deficits, and multiple endocrinopathies [1] , this treatment modality has largely been replaced by intensive intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy, and radiation is now reserved only for patients at high risk of central-nervous-system (CNS) relapse. It has been well recognized that high-risk genetic features, T-cell immunophenotype, a large leukemic cell burden, and CNS leukemia are associated with an increased risk of CNS relapse. In 1993, we reported that the presence of any number of identifiable leukemic cells in cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis also conferred an increased risk of CNS relapse, and proposed a new classification of CNS status at diagnosis: CNS1 denotes the absence of identifiable leukemic blast cells in cerebrospinal fluid; CNS2 the presence of leukemic cells in a sample that contains fewer than 5 white blood cells/L; and CNS3 a nontraumatic sample that contains 5 or more white blood cells/L with identifiable blasts in cerebrospinal fluid, or the presence of a cerebral mass or cranial nerve palsy [2] . Although the prognostic impact of CNS2 status on eventfree survival has since been shown to be treatment-dependent, patients with this feature still have 2-to 3-fold increased risk of CNS relapse in many clinical trials [3] [4] [5] [6] . In a subsequent study, we reported that traumatic lumbar puncture with identifiable blast cells in cerebrospinal fluid at diagnosis of ALL was also associated with an increased risk of CNS relapse and a poor event-free survival [7] , a finding confirmed by two recent studies [6, 8] . The adverse consequence of traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts may not only be due to the iatrogenic introduction of blast cells into CNS but could also be due to less effective subsequent intrathecal therapy because of poor distribution of drugs in the CNS due to a hematoma in the epidural or subarachnoid space, or to scarring or segmentation of the subarachnoid membrane. Recognizing the adverse impact of traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts, we intensified triple intrathecal therapy for these patients in Total Therapy study XIIIB, as had been done for patients with a CNS2 status [9] . In this study, cranial irradiation was administered to 12% of the patients with either T-cell ALL and a leukocyte count of 100x109/L or with CNS3 status. This approach resulted in a 5-year cumulative incidence of isolated CNS relapse of 1.7%\u00b10.8%, and of any CNS relapse of 3.0%\u00b11.1%; none of the patients with traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts developed CNS relapse in this study.

However, about 40% of patients with AML experience relapse, and many survivors face serious longterm effects of treatment with large doses of anthracyclines, alkylating agents, blood products, antibiotics, and/or radiation therapy. Since the mid-1970s, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (St. Jude) has designed and conducted clinical trials for children and adolescents with AML. This presentation will discuss the efficacy and toxicity of the consecutive St. Jude AML studies and will suggest areas for further improvement. The long-term outcomes of patients treated on four consecutive front-line St. Jude AML studies (AML-805, AML-836, AML-871, and AML-919) have recently been updated [10] . The AML-80 protocol (enrollment, 1980 through 1983)5 compared allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with sequential intensive chemotherapy for patients in first complete remission (CR). The overall CR rate was 80%. The 15-year event-free survival (EFS) estimate was 44.4%\u00b114.8% (SE) for the 9 patients who underwent HSCT and 26.8%\u00b1 5.7% for the 56 patients treated with chemotherapy alone. However, after adjusting for time to transplant, we observed no statistically significant difference in overall (p=0.52) or event-free (p=0.76) survival between these groups. The AML-83 study (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) [6] was based on the hypothesis of Goldie and Coldman that maximal early eradication of leukemia cells by using multiple noncross resistant chemotherapy agents would improve outcome. Patients in CR received 16 cycles of post-remission non-ablative chemotherapy. HSCT was not offered to patients in first CR. Although the remission rate was 88.9%, the 15year EFS estimate of these patients was only 8.9%\u00b13.8%. In the AML-87 protocol1 (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) , the dosage of etoposide and Ara-C was adjusted on the basis of plasma drug concentration to optimize systemic exposure. The overall rate of CR was 82%. About 3.5% of patients died from complications of early therapy. Reflecting the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, the death rate during remission in the postremission therapy phase was relatively high, (about 10%). The 10-year EFS and overall survival estimates were 33.3%\u00b17.3% and 48.7%\u00b17.8%, respectively. Long-term survivors have experienced several chronic medical problems. In the AML-91 protocol9 (1991 through 1996), all patients began therapy with cladribine (2-CDA) alone; patients who had a complete or partial response received another course of 2-CDA before proceeding to postremission chemotherapy and either autologous or allogeneic HSCT during first remission. Retroviral gene-marking was used to determine the origin of relapse after autologous transplantation [2] . Patients whose leukemia did not respond to 2-CDA received two or three courses of daunomycin, Ara-C, and etoposide (DAV) before proceeding to transplant. The overall remission rate was 79%. The EFS and overall survival estimates were 43.5%\u00b16.3% and 56.5%\u00b16.3% at 5 years and 41.8%\u00b110.6% and 53.0%\u00b17.0% at 10 years. After adjustment for time-to transplant, patients receiving chemotherapy alone were not at significantly greater risk of an adverse event than patients receiving autologous transplants (p=0.43) or allogeneic transplants (p=0.39).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 122, "end": 125, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 820, "end": 824, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1435, "text": "(1983)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1442, "text": "(1984)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1449, "text": "(1985)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1456, "text": "(1986)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1463, "text": "(1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1467, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1897, "end": 1903, "text": "(1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1910, "text": "(1988)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1911, "end": 1917, "text": "(1989)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1924, "text": "(1990)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1931, "text": "(1991)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2868, "end": 2871, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The AML-97 protocol4 (1997-2002) built on the AML-91 study. It consisted of 2-CDA given by 2-hour bolus infusion plus Ara-C administered either as a 2hour bolus infusion (Arm A) or a continuous infusion (Arm B). The combination of Ara-C with 2-CDA was chosen because of evidence that giving Ara-C with another nucleoside analogue increased the accumulation of ara-CTP in the circulating blast cells in both adult and pediatric AML. Initially, all patients received postremission HSCT. Patients with high-risk AML [monosomy or deletion 7, 5q, trisomy 11 or 8, t(9;22), secondary AML, megakaryoblastic leukemia, or absence of remission after first course of DAV] were candidates for allogeneic HSCT. Others were eligible for autologous HSCT; autologous marrow was purged by two different methods and marked with a retroviral vector. In 1998, because the retroviral marker was not available, the protocol was amended to substitute two courses of intensive chemotherapy for autologous HSCT. Between March 1997 and May 2002, 78 children with newly diagnosed, untreated primary AML were enrolled on the St. Jude AML-97 protocol. Thirty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive 2-CDA plus short daily infusions of Ara-C, and 40 were assigned to receive 2-CDA plus continuous infusion of Ara-C. Forty-nine patients' bone marrow samples contained sufficient leukemic blast cells for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies (21 patients in Arm A and 28 in Arm B). The leukemia cells of patients on Arm A (receiving short daily infusions of Ara-C) contained significantly higher median ara-CTP levels than those of patients on Arm B (receiving continuous-infusion Ara-C) on both day 1 (p=0.0378) and day 2 (p=0.0220). No significant difference was observed between Arm A and Arm B in inhibition of DNA synthesis on day 1 or day 2 of treatment. Of 78 patients enrolled in the AML-97 study, one died of fungal infection during ara-C and 2-CDA therapy and was not evaluable for response. Of the 77 evaluable patients, 43 (56%) achieved CR after one course of ara-C and 2-CDA, 69 (90%) achieved CR after a course of DAV, and 74 (96%) achieved CR after an additional course of DAV induction therapy. A CR was documented in 16 of 37 patients (43%) after short-infusion Ara-C plus 2-CDA (Arm A) and in 27 of 34 patients (67%) after continuous-infusion Ara-C plus 2-CDA (Arm B; p=0.0404). After the first course of DAV, 30 of 37 (81%) Arm A patients and 39 of 40 (98%) Arm B patients achieved remission (p=0.025). After the second course of DAV, all 40 patients in Arm B and 34 of 37 (92%) in Arm A had achieved remission (p= 0.106). The estimated 3-year EFS for the entire cohort is 48.1%\u00b16.1%. The EFS did not differ significantly by treatment arm (p=0.467) or by karyotype (p=0.106). The estimated 3-year overall survival for the entire cohort is 54.5% \u00b16.7%. Overall survival did not differ significantly by arm (p = 0.577) or by karyotype (p=0.385) in the study group as a whole. The AML-97 study also assessed the usefulness of a 4-color flow cytometric strategy developed in our laboratory to study residual disease. About 85% of the newly diagnosed cases of AML had immunophenotypes that allowed detection of 0.1%-0.01% residual leukemic cells. The 2-year survival estimate was 33.1%\u00b119.1% for patients with 0.1% AML cells by flow cytometry after induction therapy but 72.1%\u00b111.5% for those with <0.1% AML cells (P=0.022); overt recurrence of AML within the subsequent 6 months was significantly more likely in the former group [3] . The current St. Jude AML study, AML-0212, assigns therapy according to risk and leukemia genotype. Risk factor stratification is similar to that of the AML-97 study but incorporates FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) status and information about the amount of minimal residual disease (MRD) after each cycle of induction therapy. Patients with FLT-3 ITD are considered at high risk of relapse regardless of other features. For patients with MRD 1% after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy, Mylotarg is added either alone or in combination with Ara-C, daunomycin, and etoposide. Allogeneic HSCT (with a matched related or unrelated donor) is recommended during first CR for patients at high risk of relapse and for patients at standard risk of relapse if a related matched donor is available. Because outcome was not influenced by the Ara-C schedule or intracellular incorporation of Ara-CTP in AML-97, patients are randomly assigned to receive Ara-C on a high-or standard-dose schedule. Preliminary results of the first 112 patients enrolled on AML-02 were recently presented [12] . The overall rate of CR has been excellent regardless of the initial randomization. Only three patients had not obtained a CR (resistant AML, 2 patients; infectious complication, 1 patient) after the induction II phase (CR rate, 97%). The 1-year event-free and overall survival estimates are 76.8%\u00b15.1% and 89.1%\u00b13.8%, respectively. As a group, AML cases with FLT-3 ITD have fared poorly: only 1 of 11 patients was MRD-negative after Induction I and only 3 were MRD-negative after Induction II. Initially, central nervous system (CNS)directed therapy consisted of intrathecal Ara-C alone. Because CNS relapse occurred in 3 of the first 33 patients treated, intrathecal therapy was changed from Ara-C alone to triple combination therapy with methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine; none of the 79 subsequent patients has had a CNS relapse.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3529, "end": 3532, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4623, "end": 4627, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The St. Jude consecutive clinical trails have provided important lessons in the management of children and adolescents with AML and a framework for future studies. As noted in AML-80, AML-91, and many other studies, the role of HSCT in the overall management of AML remains to be established. AML-83, which had the poorest results of the St. Jude AML trials, revealed that when remission is achieved with non-myeloablative cycles of chemotherapy, the longterm results are dismal even with prolonged maintenance therapy. Despite its overall poor results, AML-83 demonstrated that subtypes of AML defined by morphology or genetic features respond differently to treatment. The rate of CR after etoposide plus Ara-C was almost twice as high in the morphologically defined FAB M4 or M5 subtypes as that in other FAB subtypes. Further, aggregate data from AML-80 and AML-83 showed that the 2-year EFS estimate of patients with M5 AML and the t(9;11) was 75% [11] . In the AML-87 protocol, one of the most intensive St. Jude AML regimens to date, the dosages of both cytarabine and etoposide were adjusted to achieve a targeted plasma concentration. As expected, the combination delivered on this schedule caused severe gastrointestinal toxicity, which usually delayed the next course of chemotherapy. Despite the intensity of treatment (a 15% death rate during remission from infectious complications) and the use of HSCT for selected patients in second remission, the 10-year survival rate was only 40%. This and other studies of pediatric AML demonstrate that the indiscriminate intensification of early therapy may reduce overall survival rates by increasing mortality caused by toxicity or by unduly delaying subsequent consolidation therapy. In AML-91, which used single-agent 2-CDA to induce remission, the remission rate of 78% was comparable to those of previous St. Jude AML trials. As in AML-83, patients with M5 AML, the t(9;11), or both had very good responses to 2-CDA7. However, patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia had very poor responses (no CR among 10 patients). In the AML-97 study, which randomly assigned patients to two different schedules of Ara-C in combination with 2-CDA in the first induction cycle, the CR rate was significantly higher with continuous infusion of Ara-C but was not correlated with intracellular accumulation of Ara-CTP or inhibition of DNA synthesis. In that protocol, we began to systematically assess the clinical significance of MRD. In the current AML-02 protocol, information about MRD is being used to guide treatment choices. However, contrary to findings in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the absence of residual AML after completion of induction therapy does not virtually assure that relapse will not occur.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 953, "end": 957, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "In summary, the St. Jude experience suggests that early intensive chemotherapy with excellent supportive care produces remission rates greater than 90% in children and adolescents with AML. However, our results and those of others show that about 40% of cases of AML are highly resistant to current therapy and that further intensification of therapy is unlikely to improve outcome. CNS-directed therapy has also been a point of contention among study groups and has not been systematically studied. The St. Jude experience suggests that risk-directed triple intrathecal chemotherapy in the context of intensive systemic chemotherapy is likely to be effective even for patients with CNS leukemia, and that cranial irradiation may not be necessary. Future clinical trials for AML should identify specific treatment questions for specific subsets of patients. For example, AML with FLT-3 ITD appears to be resistant to conventional chemotherapy and perhaps to HSCT. It is possible that the use of FLT-3 inhibitors in front-line therapy might improve the outcome of this subgroup of patients. Patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, biphenotypic leukemia, or AML associated with myelodysplastic features, who are unlikely to benefit from intensive chemotherapy, could be invited to participate in innovative trials. Finally, because of the small number of patients in specific subgroups of pediatric AML, clinical investigations should be conducted as multi-institutional collaborations. Through the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy, cure is now a reality for most patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In fact, several modern approaches based on this combination have led to prolonged disease-free survival and potential cure for more than 80% of patients achieving complete remission. The current consensus on the most appropriate induction therapy, once a diagnosis of APL has been confirmed at the genetic level, consists of the simultaneous administration of ATRA and anthracyclinebased chemotherapy. The choice of anthracycline and whether it should be combined with other agents, such as cytosine arabinoside, remain controversial. Exceptions to the use of anthracycline-based induction regimens should be considered only for individual patients in whom chemotherapy is contraindicated. This is the case of patients with certain clinical conditions such as severe organ failure, anticoagulant therapy, very elderly patients, and others, in whom the toxicity of intensive chemotherapy is often unacceptable. For these cases, arsenic trioxide (ATO) has recently emerged as a suitable alternative.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Unlike induction therapy, there is not the same degree of consensus on the most appropriate consolidation therapy, except for giving at least two or three cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Although the antileukemic benefit provided by the addition of ATRA to consolidation therapy has not been demonstrated in randomized studies, historical comparisons of consecutive studies carried out separately by the GIMEMA and PETHEMA groups suggest that the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy for consolidation may also contribute to improving therapeutic results in APL. Another interesting issue addressed in the aforementioned GIMEMA and PETHEMA studies [4, 5] was the design of risk-adapted approaches to administer distinct treatment intensities for consolidation based on pre-defined risk of relapse. According to these studies, this strategy seems a suitable approach to minimize therapy-related morbidity and mortality while maintaining the potential of cure for each relapse-risk group.

In November 1999, aiming to improve the antileukemic efficacy in patients with increased relapse risk, the PETHEMA started the trial LPA99 based on a risk-adapted strategy. The results obtained in the first 426 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PML/RAR positive APL who were enrolled in these two consecutive studies (LPA96 and LPA99) were recently reported in Blood [5] . This study, which was recently updated including a significantly higher number of patients and longer follow-up than in the first report, shows that combining ATRA with anthracycline monochemotherapy for induction and consolidation, followed by ATRA and low dose methotrexate and mercaptopurine for maintenance therapy, results in extremely high antileukemic efficacy, moderate toxicity and a high degree of compliance in patients with APL.

Induction failures were mainly due to death during remission, confirming the virtual absence of drug resistance. It should be noted that the only 4 cases labeled as resistant leukemia were all evaluated too early for response, between the days 19 and 33 after completion chemotherapy. Today, it is well known that a proportion of patients need up to 40 or 50 days to complete terminal differentiation of blasts. The two major causes of failure were bleeding and infection, accounting for around 5% and 3%, respectively.

This improved antileukemic efficacy was certainly caused by the modified consolidation therapy. Although it is unclear which part of the reinforced consolidation therapy (ATRA or chemotherapy or both) may have led to the impact observed in the outcome, it is likely that the addition of ATRA has had a significant role. Based on these results and those recently reported by the GIMEMA Group, [4] we believe that the current consensus on the simultaneous administration of ATRA and chemotherapy for induction and maintenance therapy of APL could be extended to the consolidation phase. In addition, future clinical investigations should focus on developing new therapeutic approaches to decrease the relapse rate in high-risk patients with hyperleukocytosis at presentation and progressively decreasing treatment intensity for the remaining patients. Keeping in mind these thoughts, the PETHEMA and HOVON groups have designed and recently started a new risk-adapted protocol (LPA2005) with the following mainstays: 1) Low-and intermediate-risk patients will be treated with a combination of ATRA and anthracycline monochemotherapy for induction and also for consolidation, followed by ATRA and low dose chemotherapy (methotrexate and mercaptopurine) for maintenance therapy. The addition of ATRA in consolidation therapy for low-risk patients and a dose reduction of mitoxantrone for low-and intermediate-risk patients are the changes proposed for the currently ongoing study (LPA2005) in comparison with the previous one (LPA99); and 2) The still unsatisfactory relapse rate observed in high-risk patients has induced to reinforce consolidation chemotherapy with the addition of ara-C to the idarubicin courses for patients younger than 60 years. This option was based on the results recently reported by the GIMEMA4 and the European APL groups that suggest a role of ara-C in this setting.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 651, "end": 654, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The incidence of AML spans the entire age spectrum but is highest in adults greater than 60 years of age. Large numbers of randomized trials have been performed in patients with AML including comparative evaluations of different doses and types of chemotherapeutic agents (in particular, different types of anthracyclines and different doses and schedules of administration of ara-c), the use of hematopoietic growth factors, stem cell transplantation in first remission and modulation of various mechanisms of intrinsic drug resistance Some of these trials have, in fact, changed the standard care of the disease in younger patients, but unfortunately, most have failed to improve remission rates and overall survival in both older and younger patients.

Accordingly, different subgroups could be defined, showing a broad variety in terms of prognosis, ranging from rather sensitive diseases with a reasonable chance for cure by conventional chemotherapy, to refractory cases with a median survival of few months. Increased risk can defined (1) at time of diagnosis and (2) during the course of the disease. At diagnosis, the karyotype of the malignant clone is the best established risk factor1-3. Although some difference exist among the definitions of prognostic cytogenetic subgroups, all research teams have identified t(15;17), inv16 and t(8;21) as favorable aberrations, whereas monosomy 5 and 7, del 7q, del 5q (in AML, not in MDS), and a komplex aberrant karyotyp (i.e. 3 or more aberrations) are associated with a dismal outcome. A history of MDS or of chemo/radiotherapy prior to the diagnosis of AML represents another adverse factors, as does progressive MDS at a stage RAEB I or II. During the course of the disease, increased risk can be defined by failure or delayed response to induction chemotherapy4,5, early relapse after a remission duration of less then 6-12 months, second or higher relapse and relapse following high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. 6 In the light of unsatisfying results with conventional therapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the recommended treatment for high risk AML and MDS.7-9 However, due to relapse and treatment-related complications, long term survival is rare.10 Particularly in elderly patients, patients with MDS and secondary AML, and patients with advanced disease, non-relapse mortality (NRM) may reach >70%.11-14 Therefore, the development of new transplantation strategies is warranted in order to find a balance between antileukemic activity and treatment-associated toxicity. (15) During recent years, the role of high-dose chemo/radiation therapy for the elimination of leukemia in allogeneic SCT has been questioned. Instead, the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect appears to play a major role. GvL reactions are known from animal studies (16) and clinical trials (17) . In AML, evidence for a GvL effect comes from the lower relapse rates and improved progression-free survival following allogeneic as compared to autologous HSCT, (18) and from the higher risk of relapse in patients who received a T-cell depleted transplant or did not develop graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (17) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1433, "end": 1434, "text": "6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2018, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2283, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2308, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2476, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2619, "end": 2623, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been advocated to reduce transplantation-associated toxicity in elderly or medically unfit patients.

Similar protocols had been effective in high-risk AML and advanced CML (27) . Instead of anthracyclins, amsacrine was introduced. This drug has shown to be similarly effective in poor prognosis AML, while being less cardiotoxic (28) . AML patients have regularly been treated with considerable doses of anthracyclins before transplantation. Therefore, the use of a different drug seemed also reasonable to prevent chemoresistance. Chemotherapy aimed at targeting rapidly proliferating malignant cells in order to reduce the leukemia burden before RIC and SCT. It was followed by three days of rest, allowing time, in particular to the patient's intestinal mucosa, to recover from acute toxicity. Then, RIC consisted of 4Gy total body irradiation (TBI) on day -5, cyclophosphamide (40mg/kg with HLA-id sibling, 60 mg/kg for unrelated or mismatched donors) on days -4 and -3, and rabbit antithymococyte globulin (ATG; 10 mg/kg for HLA-id sibling, 20 m/kg for unrelated or mismatched donors) from day -4 until day -2.

(2) The possibility that inhibiting a critical pathophysiological event could interrupt the leukemogenic process has been an intriguing notion in developmental therapeutics. While some strategies have involved targeting mutated forms of the guanosine residue-binding protein, ras,(3) the most interesting therapeutic target in AML over the last five years has been the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 389, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Pre-Clinical Development FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase in which ligand binding triggers a pro-proliferative signaling cascade. The FLT3 protein is expressed in 80% of blasts from patients with AML; the expression level has been deemed to be 'high' in 50% of such patients.(4) The critical observation is that an activating mutation of FLT3 can be found in leukemic cells from 30-35% of patients with AML. These mutations fall into two subtypes: 25-30% of AML patients' blasts have a 3-33 amino acid repeat (internal tandem duplication; ITD) in the juxtamembrane region of the molecule. Another 5-10% of AML patients' blasts can be shown to have a point mutation, typically an aspartate to a tyrosine mutation in the 835th codon in the so-called activation loop that resides in the carboxy terminus of the molecule. Each of these mutations confers ligandindependent kinase activity.(4) Constructs carrying either type of mutation are capable of conferring factor-independent growth in factor-dependent leukemic cell lines.(5) Secondly, mice who receive marrow transplants with stem cells carrying an activated FLT3 mutation develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder. (6) In keeping with the notion that multiple genetic events are required for fullblown leukemogenesis, the leukemic cells from such animals are more mature appearing than would be seen in a typical patient with AML. Additional mutations, such as those transcription factor abnormalities seen in good prognosis subtypes of AML, are required to cooperate with such tyrosine kinase mutations to cause full-blown murine leukemia in model systems. (7) There have been numerous clinical studies in the past decade that have examined the relationship between oncogene mutations and the natural history of AML. Most studies have shown that internal tandem duplication mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase confer adverse prognosis. (8, 9) This is particularly true for AML patients with a normal karyotype. Activating mutations of FLT3 tend to be more common in those with either a normal karyotype, the t(15;17) typical of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or the t(6;9) translocation characteristic of the rare entity of AML with basophilia.(4) It is controversial whether a FLT3 mutation is an independent negative prognostic factor in APL;(10) moreover, studies have failed to show a consistent correlation between activation loop mutations and prognosis.(11) It does appear that loss of the normal allele in conjunction with a FLT3 mutation (hemizygosity) is a particularly ominous prognostic sign. (12) Various strategies to inhibit FLT3 signaling are in development including antibodies (13) and chaperone protein inhibition (14) to decrease the half-life of the molecule, but the greatest interest has been in the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors including SU112428, SU5416, CEP701, MLN518, and PKC412 which have each gone through pre-clinical and early clinical testing. They specifically kill leukemic cell lines transformed with either of the activated constructs of FLT3.(15) Moreover, these agents have been shown to prolong the survival of mice with a fatal activated FLT3-mediated murine myeloproliferative disorder.(16) Each of these molecules inhibits FLT3 in the nanomolar range but they vary in terms of chemical structure, preclinical side effect profile and most notably the spectrum of kinase in which they inhibit. For example, PKC412 not only inhibits the FLT3 tyrosine kinase but it also inhibits ckit, and the serine-threonine protein kinase C. (17) Single Agent Clinical Studies The initial development of these agents has demonstrated that doses producing plasma levels capable of inhibiting FLT3 are tolerable and are associated with some degree of preliminary biological efficacy in AML patients especially those harboring an activating mutation. The first two FLT3 inhibitors studied, SU11248 (18) and SU5416 (19) were developed in AML not based on FLT3 inhibition, but rather because they were potent inhibitors of the c-kit tyrosine kinase involved in leukemic proliferation and/or the VEGFR tyrosine kinase maintaining leukemic survival via malignant cell-stromal cell interactions. A Phase I/II study of CEP701 (20) was restricted to AML patients who carried an activating mutation of FLT3 and who were not deemed to be chemotherapy candidates. Of the 17 patients treated, several experienced a reduction in their peripheral blast counts. The drug was well tolerated but no complete remissions were achieved. A tolerable dose of the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412 had been documented in an earlier Phase I trial in solid tumors (21) carried out because it inhibited protein kinase C. A \"proof-of-concept\" trial in which PKC412 was administered at a dose of 75 mg orally three times daily to 20 patients who had an ITD (17) or activation loop mutation (3) were recently reported. (22) 70% of the patients experienced at least a transient reduction in their peripheral blast count of which half, or 35% overall, achieved a two-log reduction which lasted at least four weeks. One of the 20 patients achieved a response that met all criteria for complete remission except for marrow hypocellularity. Problems included a lack of durable response in most cases, a greater effect on the peripheral blast count then on marrow blast count, an induction of the drug's own metabolism with continued use, and fatal pulmonary toxicity in two patients. PKC412 was administered at other doses (50 mg twice daily orally or 100 mg twice daily orally) to non-chemotherapy candidate AML patients. Preliminary results of this study indicate that, while there were responses in wild-type patients at both doses, responses were more common and more profound in patients with an activating mutation of FLT3.(23) MLN518 has been subjected to two singleagent trials. The first was a Phase I effort in patients with relapsed and refractory and those deemed inappropriate for chemotherapy. The dose limiting toxicity at (525 mg twice daily) was muscle weakness; several patients who achieved a high enough plasma concentration and had a FLT3 mutation achieved a reduction in peripheral blasts. (24) Phase II testing of this compound in a trial restricted to those with an FLT3 ITD mutation showed blast reductions but no CRs. (25) Small Molecule FLT3 Inhibitors in Combination with Chemotherapy Trials employing the small molecule FLT3 inhibitors as single agents, especially in patients whose blasts have shown to have an activating mutation, demonstrated biological activity, but probably not enough clinical activity to merit their use in this fashion. However, more studies in chemotherapy na\u00efve mutant FLT3 patients remain to be done. Perhaps the best way to take advantage of the intrinsic biological activity of these agents is to combine them with other effective drugs.

The detection of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) in 1960 provided a marker that almost unequivocally defined the disease.

Therefore DNA methylation has provided a target for inducing differentiation by pharmacological inhibition of this process to achieve cellular differentiation (Pinto et al. 1984 ). More recently, the aberrant hypermethylation of many growth-regulatory and several proapoptotic genes has led to further acknowledgement of hypermethylation as a molecular target for novel treatment approaches in hematologic neoplasias, hemoglobinopathies and solid tumors (L\u00fc bbert et al. 2000) . The discovery of the DNA methylation inhibition by analogues of cytidine, i. e. the azanucleosides 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) and 5aza-2\u00b4-deoxycytidine (Decitabine, Dacogen) was made by Jones and Taylor (1980) . This seminal discovery was based on the induction of terminal cellular differentiation to functional myocytes chondrocytes and adipocytes in an embryonal fibroblast model. Since then, the development of both azanucleosides, and more recently novel small molecules also aimed at DNA inhibition, has followed a slow, arduous and often rocky path (Lyko and Brown 2005) .

This suggests that the underlying biology of these subtypes of ALL differs and in conjunction with this also their underlying resistance mechanisms and the gene expression profiles with predictive value for outcome. Indeed we showed that for instance the mechanism of L-Asparaginase differs between TEL-AML1 rearranged ALL and other genetic subtypes of ALL. In the latter the expression of asparagine synthetase was related to L-asparaginase resistance while in TEL-AML1 rearranged ALL this was not the case [5] . This also implies that it might be difficult to identify one single gene that predicts outcome in all subtypes of ALL.

In acute myeloid leukemia, increased microvessel densities have been found on bone marrow biopsies compared to those of patients with reactive disorders. Constitutive secretion of angiogenic factors by leukemic blasts have been shown to induce proliferation of endothelial cells. These factors include VEGF, FGF and angiopoietin-1. VEGF secretion by leukemic blasts has been shown to represent a prognostic factor in AML. Our group has further analyzed the prognostic implication of growth factor m-RNA expression. In 90 patients younger than 60 years of age treated within a protocol of the AML SHG Hannover we could show that high expression levels of angiopoietin-2 conferred a favorable prognosis. Angiopoietin-2 acts an inhibitor of angiopoieitin-1 by competing for their common receptor tie-2. These results indicate that inhibition of tie-2, especially with concomitant blockade of VEGF, may represent a new treatment strategy in AML. To further investigate this concept we have developed a mouse AML model in which therapeutic blood levels of soluble neuropilin, a VEGF receptor, and angiopietin-2 can be achieved by somatic gene therapy.Furthermore several early clinical studies with small molecule VEGF receptor antagonists, such as SU5416 and SU11248 have been conducted. Partial responses in a subgroup of patients have been observed. Molecular evidence of efficacious receptor blockade and reduction of downstream signaling in AML blasts has been gathered in patients.

In the HLA matched HSCT setting, minor H antigen disparities between recipient and donor induce allo-immune responses leading to Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD), graft rejection and to the curative Graft-versus-Tumor (GvT) response. Minor H antigens with restricted tissue expression are especially relevant for the GvT response after HSCT. We proposed to use the tissue restricted minor H antigens as curative tools in combination with HSCT. A potential efficient treatment strategy is vaccination of patients by boosting the donor GvT response at appropriate times after HSCT with the tumor specific minor H peptides.

Due to the rarity of APL relapses it is difficult to carry out randomized studies. It is therefore the objective of the prospective controlled study started by the AMLCG in January 2005 (Figure 3) to use the therapeutic strategy most suited for the individual including ATO, within an established approach. Induction and consolidation with ATO are mandatory. The further stratification of treatment is optional but recommended as follows: Patients eligible for allogeneic transplantation should undergo allogeneic transplantation. PCR-negative patients without a donor but eligible for autologous transplantation should receive an autologous transplant. The application of chemotherapy in the allogeneic approach and the intensity of chemotherapy in the autologous setting for stem cell collection are stratified according to the PCR results with the intention to give not more chemotherapy as necessary to avoid toxicity. Patients not eligible for transplantation can receive further ATO cycles. Inclusion criteria in this study are the first or later hematological or molecular relapse of APL and the persistence of a positive PCR after induction and consolidation.

Results: 418 of 473 (88%) patients achieved remission. Early death rate was reduced compared to study 93: 3.2% vs.7.4%.Five-year survival, event-free (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 62%+ 3%, 49%+3% and 57%+3%, respectively. Estimated survival improved (study 93: 58%+2%, plogrank .03), pEFS and pDFS were similar to study 93 (50%+2% and 61%+2%, n.s.). Results of the randomised 6-week consolidation (n=191) vs. the 2-cycle arm (n=199) were similar (pEFS 51%+4 and 50%+4%, n.s.). However, total treatment duration was shorter, and mortality was lower in the 2cycle arm (5 vs. 9 deaths in CCR). Results in the randomised G-CSF arm showed a significantly shortened duration of neutropenia after induction, but neither influence on the incidence of infectious complications nor on the pEFS. There was no improvement of prognosis in SR patients compared to the previous study 93 despite additional administration of HAM (CR rate 93% vs. 89%, p(chi) .24, 5-year pEFS 62%+4% vs. 67%+4%; n.s.).

Some prefer only chemotherapy i.e. continuation of consolidation courses and/or maintenance chemotherapy; others proceed with some form of autologous (auto-SCT) or allogeneic (allo-SCT) stem cell transplantation. Several large studies comparing IC courses with stem cell transplantation report contradictory results. In the AML-8A trial of the EORTC and GIMEMA Leukemia Groups, it has been shown that auto-SCT leads to a significant longer DFS than a second intensive consolidation course (48% vs 30% at 4 years)1. In this trial, in patients younger than 46 years, an 8% survival superiority (48% v 40%) at 6 years for the donor stem cell transplantation group (containing all patients with a HLAidentical family donor) compared to the no donor group (those who were eligible for an auto-SCT or IC) has been observed as well2. This difference was not significant (P=0.24) due, in part, to an insufficient numbers of patients per treatment group. Similarly Burnett et al reported in their recent MRC AML-10 trial in which patients after four chemotherapy courses continued with allo-or auto-SCT or no further treatment that the patients with a donor had a higher 7year DFS rate than the patients without a donor (50% versus 42%) with the most pronounced effect in the cytogenetically intermediate risk group3-4.The EORTC and GIMEMA investigators subsequently conducted a randomized study (AML-10) for patients under the age of 61 years consisting of one or two three-drug induction courses followed by an intensive consolidation course and, for those under the age of 46 years, an allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the case of an available family donor or an auto-SCT in the other patients5. Between November 1993 and December 1999, of 1198 patients aged < 46 years, 822 achieved CR. The study group constituted 734 patients who received IC: 293 had a sibling donor and 441 did not. Allo-SCT and auto-SCT was performed in 68.9% and 55.8%, respectively. Cytogenetics was successfully performed in 446 patients. Risk groups were: good (t(8;21), inv (16)), intermediate (NN or -Y only), bad/very bad (all others). Median follow-up was 4 years; 289 pts relapsed, 66 died in CR1, and 293 died. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that the 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate of patients with a donor versus of those without a donor was 52.2% versus 42.2%, p=0.044; hazard ratio=0.80, 95% confidence interval (0.64 , 0.995), the relapse incidence was 30.4% versus 52.5%, death in CR1 was 17.4% versus 5.3%, and the survival rate was 58.3% vs 50.8% (p=0.18). The DFS rates in patients with and without a sibling donor were similar in patients with good/intermediate risk, but were 43.4% and 18.4%, respectively, in patients with bad/very bad risk cytogenetics. In younger patients (15-35 yrs) , the difference was more pronounced.Recently a compilation of the results of several consecutive HOVON-SAKK studies showed a DFS and survival advantage for patients in complete remission with a donor vs those without a donor6.. This was true for patients with intermediate as well as bad risk cytogenetics.None of the mentioned randomized trials did show an advantage of an allo-SCT for patients with good risk cytogenetics.Currently the EORTC and GIMEMA Leukemia Groups assess in their AML-12 randomized phase III trial the efficacy and toxicity of HD-AraC (3 g/m2 q 12 hrs for 4 days) in combination with daunorubicin (50 mg/m2 for 3 days) and etoposide (50 mg/m2 for 5 days) vs SD-AraC (100 mg/m2 for 10 days) combined with the same drugs. All patients (pts) who reach a complete remission (CR) will receive one consolidation course consisting of ID-AraC (500 mg/m2 q 12 hrs for 6 days) and daunorubicin. Subsequently an allogeneic (allo-SCT) or an autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) is planned according to donor availability and age. A second randomization is performed after consolidation in patients without a donor: auto-SCT followed or not by maintenance with low dose IL-2 (4-8 x 106 IU s.c. for 5 days per month) during one year. From 1999 till October 2005, 1434 AML pts (APL excluded), age<61 years, from 65 centers (23 EORTC-LG and 42 GIMEMA) entered the trial. Currently 1330 pts have been randomized for induction and 372 pts postconsolidation. During the induction course toxicity profiles were similar in the 2 arms; however in the HD-AraC group the incidence of grade 3-4 liver transaminase abnormalities (15% vs 11.5%) and conjunctivitis (6% vs 0%) was higher. HD-AraC in the induction cycle had no impact on the organ toxicity during the consolidation course, but the platelet recovery (>50x109/l) was significantly longer (median 4.4 vs 3.1 weeks). The IL-2 schedule was well tolerated in most pts with fatigue (20%), rigor/chills (6.5%), arthralgia/myalgia (4%) as the main grade 3-4 toxicities. Among 628 pts randomized until December 2004 by EORTC centers and 6 large GIMEMA centers, with a median follow-up of 2.2 years, 481 reached CR. Among 443 pts who received a consolidation course, 63 pts went off-study due to toxicity/relapse or no information is still available, and 380 pts were still CR after consolidation: 163 had no donor, 144 had a donor and 69 have not been HLA typed (too old, other reasons). In these 3 groups the present estimates of the transplantation rates were: 59% (auto-SCT), 74% (allo-SCT) and 66% (auto-SCT), respectively. The 2-yr DFS rates (SE%) were 51% (5%), 65% (5%), and 55% (7%), respectively in the donor, no donor and not HLA typed group. Patients with a donor (N=144) had a longer DFS rate than patients without a donor (N=163): the estimated hazard ratio adjusted for age was 0.60, 95% CI (0.37, 0.97).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3150, "end": 3161, "text": "(15-35 yrs)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "1. allo-SCT is currently the best available antileukemic treatment modality 2. cytogenetically good risk patients in first complete remission should not be considered candidates for allo-SCT (unless the transplantation related mortality decreases) 3. allo-SCT in AML in first complete remission in younger patients (15-35 yrs old) leads to a DFS and (possibly) survival advantage in patients with leukemia with intermediate or bad risk cytogenetics", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}]}
