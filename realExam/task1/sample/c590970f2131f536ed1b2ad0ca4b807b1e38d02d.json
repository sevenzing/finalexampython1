However, the potential of persistent infections to develop towards pathogenesis remains to be investigated, particularly with respect to the role of host metabolism. To explore the interactions between cellular metabolism and persistent/pathogenic virus infection, we performed untargeted and targeted metabolomic analysis to examine the effects of Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV, Dicistroviridae) in persistently infected silkworm Bm5 cells and acutely infected Drosophila S2 cells. Our previous study (Viruses 2019, 11, 861) established that both glucose and glutamine levels significantly increased during the persistent period of CrPV infection of Bm5 cells, while they decreased steeply during the pathogenic stages. Strikingly, in this study, an almost opposite pattern in change of metabolites was observed during different stages of acute infection of S2 cells. More specifically, a significant decrease in amino acids and carbohydrates was observed prior to pathogenesis, while their abundance significantly increased again during pathogenesis. Our study illustrates the occurrence of diametrically opposite changes in central carbon mechanisms during CrPV infection of S2 and Bm5 cells that is possibly related to the type of infection (acute or persistent) that is triggered by the virus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Infections with cytopathic viruses typically cause cellular lethality, which explains their acute character, leading either to the death of the organism or clearing of the infection by the immune response. By contrast, non-cytopathic viruses can establish readily long-lasting (persistent) infections that manage the evasion of elimination by the immune system for very long periods [1] . Mechanisms to establish viral persistence not only include modulation of viral gene expression, subversion of apoptosis and immune evasion but can also involve the selection of particular cell types that are ideal Viruses 2020, 12 for long-term preservation [2] . Although most studies have focused on alterations in the viral genome during establishment of persistent virus infections (and loss of the cytopathic character) in cell lines, e.g., [3, 4] , evidence exists for the importance of the interaction between the genetic make-up of both host cells and virus [5] . Host and cell tropism are considered very important characteristics of viruses and differences in efficiency of viral infection can be determined at each step of the viral replication cycle [6] . However, because of the importance of cellular entry in viral infection, viral tropism is usually distinguished between receptor-dependent and -independent (i.e., intracellular) mechanisms. Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is a picorna-like virus with a (+)-ssRNA genome that has been used as a model for the study of antiviral resistance mechanisms in Drosophila, which includes inhibition of RNAi [7, 8] . CrPV causes acute pathogenic infections in flies and Drosophila cell lines, which is related to the production of the viral 1A protein, a strong RNAi inhibitor [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 383, "end": 386, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 617, "end": 619, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 647, "end": 650, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 835, "end": 838, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 839, "end": 841, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 955, "end": 958, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1154, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1557, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1560, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1726, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In our previous study, it was observed that, when applied at relatively low MOI (multiplicity of infection), CrPV does not trigger an acute infection in silkworm Bm5 cells and other lepidopteran and coleopteran cell lines [10] . A period of viral persistence was observed during which the host cells maintained a normal growth rate and low levels of CrPV replication were detected. Only 2-3 weeks after virus inoculation, cytopathic effects started to emerge, which was accompanied with the transcriptional induction of immune pathway genes [10] . The slow kinetics of CrPV infection in Bm5 cells and the other lepidopteran and coleopteran cell lines [10] stood in strong contrast with the fast infection dynamics observed in Drosophila S2 cells. When inoculated at similar MOI as for Bm5 cells, infection of S2 cells became pathogenic already after 36-48 h, which was followed by widespread mortality [10] . Our observations therefore indicate important differences between S2 cells and other (coleopteran and lepidopteran) cell lines that were investigated with respect to the pathogenicity of CrPV infection. While acute infections can be triggered in lepidopteran Hi5 cells, a much higher MOI is needed than for S2 cells and kinetics remains much slower [11] . Injection of CrPV virions in insect species of three different orders (Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera) also did not trigger pathogenic infections [12] . Thus, S2 cells seem to represent a unique case with respect to sensitivity to CrPV infection that stands in stark contrast with infections in other cell lines. From this point of view, the examination of the changes in the metabolome in response to CrPV infection in S2 cells is of particular interest since it would be representative of a cell type that is very sensitive to CrPV infection. The comparison with the persistent condition in Bm5 cells furthermore could reveal important insights regarding the impact of the metabolome on the type of CrPV infection (persistent or acute) that will occur.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 222, "end": 226, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 541, "end": 545, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 651, "end": 655, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1262, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1424, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, untargeted and targeted metabolomics was applied to S2 cells at different stages of acute infection with CrPV (6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h).

The metabolomics approach revealed striking differences with respect to central carbon metabolism during the course of infection in the two cell lines. While carbohydrates and amino acids increased in abundance during the persistent phase of infection in Bm5 cells, the metabolites became depleted during the early and middle stages of acute infection in S2 cells. At late stages of infection (i.e., 2-3 weeks in Bm5 cells, while 24-36 h in S2 cells), an opposite pattern was observed (i.e., decrease in Bm5 and increase in S2).

In addition, polyamines seem to be critical for CrPV persistence and pathogenesis. Further functional analysis is needed to confirm requirements of specific metabolites for optimal CrPV replication, and additional experiments are required to identify unknown components from the untargeted metabolomics analysis to reveal important host factors during CrPV infection.

For the untargeted approach, the principal components analysis (PCA) score plot is presented separately for the positive and negative ion mode. The t[1] and t[2] values of each data point are the average scores of all samples in the principal components 1 and 2 of the model, respectively. Below is displayed the PCA score plot based on the 59 targeted metabolites identified at different time points after CrPV infection in S2 cells. Samples of different time points are shown in different colors that reveal satisfactory separation among particular samples.
