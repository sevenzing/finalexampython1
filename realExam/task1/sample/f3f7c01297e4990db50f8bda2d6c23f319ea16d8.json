Border control measures were placed as early as January 2 nd when the Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a health advisory and implemented temperature screening for passengers arriving from Wuhan. This was gradually tightened with restrictions extended to Hubei province and then mainland China in conjunction with declaration of the outbreak as \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" on January 30 th . On Singapore's end, the public was advised successively against outbound travel to Hubei, China and subsequently Daego and Cheongdo counties in South Korea as cases in these regions multiplied. Expatriation of Singaporeans from Wuhan was carried out with stringent quarantine and SAR-2-CoV testing measures. 1 Bilateral agreements were also made with the Malaysian government in February to align screening protocols at land borders. A joint field epidemiology training network to share surveillance data was activated. This had led to identification of the first international cluster in Singapore resulting from a global business conference. Stricter travel controls in Singapore and worldwide were imperative as early studies had confirmed that the mean R 0 for COVID-19 is around 3.28. 2 By early March, travel restrictions were extended to Iran, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and United Kingdom. These restrictions were implemented before the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced COVID-19 as \"Pandemic\" on March 11 th . Further enhancement took place when Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) were issued to all overseas travellers on March 20 th . All travel restrictions and \"isolation\" orders were capped at the standard 14 days based on the COVID-19 incubation period.",

Vigorous contact tracings were conducted through activity mapping, analytic tools, surveillance footages, door-to-door inquiries with the help of Singapore Police Force, and smartphone application (TraceTogether). 4 Coupled with the antibody laboratory tests developed by Duke-NUS Medical School, the link between Singapore's two largest COVID-19 clusters in February was uncovered. 5 Fever surveillance among healthcare workers was implemented in which all healthcare workers, including clinical and non-clinical employees, were to report temperature twice daily. Employees with temperature 37.5 \u00b0C and above would be required to seek immediate medical attention and not report to work. This strategy was used to identify potentially infected healthcare workers early during the SARS outbreak in 2003. 6",

These workers were housed in mega-dormitories with capacity of up to 13,000 occupants where they lived in close proximity and shared communal facilities. They also gathered in large groups at workplaces and public spaces during rest days. The high-density living between the 180,000 workers meant that they were always at risk of promoting transmissions. A special taskforce was formed to curb the spread in dormitories and to ensure the workers' well-being. The taskforce locked down dormitories with infection clusters, isolated those symptomatic and moved some of the workers to new accommodations. Strict hygiene measures, sanitisation, and safe distancing measures were adopted. Medical support was deployed to these dormitories for early and extensive testing, isolation, and treatment.",
