This has coincided with increased demands for medical and personal protective equipment such as face shields. Shortages have been particularly prevalent in western countries which typically rely upon global supply chains to obtain these types of device from low-cost economies. National calls for the repurposing of domestic mass-production facilities have the potential to meet medical requirements in coming weeks, however the immediate demand associated with the virus has led to the mobilisation of a diverse distributed workforce. Selection of appropriate manufacturing processes and underused supply chains is paramount to the success of these operations. A simplified medical face shield design is presented which repurposes an assortment of existing alternative supply chains. The device is easy to produce with minimal equipment and training. It is hoped that the methodology and approach presented is of use to the wider community at this critical time.",

The instructions for manufacture were shared electronically, and the raw materials were distributed between distinct manufacturing sites.

This approach achieves a production rate of ~30 shields/person/hour at an approximate cost of \u00a30.40 per item. Limited tools beyond those found in a conventional office environment are required, and there is potential for the design to be modified and adapted to local availability. For example, the use of die cutting, guillotines, gluing jigs and strip cutters can drastically increase production rate and precision.
