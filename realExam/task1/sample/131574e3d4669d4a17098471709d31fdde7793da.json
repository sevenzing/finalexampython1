            "text": "especially in, Italy, Spain, and France, and now cases of COVID-19 are no longer limited to one country. Thousands of instances of disseminated contagion as well as deaths have reported in the whole world till date, and further disseminating through person to person contact. Chan et al. (8) , in The Lancet recently said a rapid increase of COVID 19 cases in the healthcare staff, indicating the severeness of human to human transmission of this disease. Huang et al. (18) reported 5 clinical symptoms of the newly admitted patients from the selected hospitals in china, and the outcomes provide data regarding the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic infections. Results emphasized the following preliminary symptoms viz. dry cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. Chan et al. (8) described that this novel zoonotic viral pathogen adapts more quickly when transmitted from human to human, thus intensifying the spread of this disease. Figure 1 10 reports the severity of the pandemic based on the data collected from the dashboard of the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University of Medicine (12). The total confirmed global cases of COVID-19 as on March 30, 2020, were 723,700, whereas the total deaths were 34,005. However, 152,032 cases reported to recovered consequently (12, 33, 34) . 15 Epidemiology is a stream of medical science dealing with the spreading, prevention, control, and suppression of infectious diseases in the human community. Human actions act as triggers for the spread of epidemics and contribute to foremost factors like climate change, environmental hazards, political, socio-economic, disease patterns, and stimulus emergence. Over the past two decades, there has been a sharp increase in the number of epidemiological studies engaging GIS, 20 particularly in the domain of health inconsistency, resource availability, and health-related performance (11) . Further there has been a persistent use of GIS in introductory arenas of malignancy and environmental epidemiology (14, 29) . GIS has also been used broadly in epidemiology for disease surveillance and observing intermediation (12). In addition to traditional epidemiological approach, medical geographers can measure the spatial distribution 25 and accessibility of health facilities using GIS (10, 15, 16) . Since the 1990s Medical Geographic Information Systems (Medical GIS) has become extremely valuable and is being applied as public health reformist system. It is used for identifying and investigating medical and epidemiological indicators for diseases ranging from cholera to cancer (5, 14, 15, 28) . The most extensively used tools for supporting this system are dynamic continuous area space-time 30 analysis, spatial statistics, agent-based modeling, cellular automata, geographical analysis machine, self-organizing maps etc. (14, 15, 21) . Medical GIS technology offers exceptional means for visualizing epidemiological data, revealing disease trends and their inter-relationships (21, 35) . It integrates the spatial and non-spatial data for analysis and decision making. It generates a widespread response, thereby reducing the health hazards in the population, during, 35 before, and after the violent events, from local to the global level (14) . Medical GIS serves for multi-disease surveillance activities using different operations viz. buffer analysis; network analysis; statistical analysis; time series analysis and spatio-temporal analysis to identify the health centers, movement of carriers, the intensity of spread etc. (4, 22) . Operative response provided by these analyses requires a commitment to risk reduction, prevention, control, and 40 timely financial support. It is proved that Medical GIS approach is playing an important role for advance planning in health education and emergency health care provisions leading to infrastructure protection and reduction in financial burden. The current study explores the Medical GIS approach in identifying the prone area of the disease using GIS overlay analysis for vulnerable groups on a global scale. The task of expanding worldwide health care disease 45 mapping using GIS has tremendous positive effects. This automated system for managing spatial .

Recently Joseph et al. (20) studied the worldwide spread of COVID-19, from Wuhan and adjacent towns. They forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV using a single parameter approach. They used periodic flight reservations over the period December 31, 2019, to January 28, 2020, and used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to 5 forecast the corona spread. Their findings suggest that independent, self-sustaining human-tohuman spread has already started, and this has resulted in a global outburst of the disease as major Chinese cities are global transport hubs. The current study estimates five parameters for analysis of the global latent spread of COVID-19 from different available sources as an extension of the previous study (20). Data were divided into five categories viz. the total number 10 of infected cases country-wise; country-wise air passenger's pressure from top ten busy airports of china including Wuhan; world population density, world meat consumption; world health ranking (country-wise). Entire data parameters converted into spatial domains and assigned weightage based on GIS fuzzy overlay function. Results represent highest to lowest health care alertness globally, on a scale of 1 to 9. As the study based on global scale parameters, hence the 15 results may vary from local to a global level. Countries across the world are taking necessary actions to prevent COVID-19 pandemic using alternate measures and techniques. In this context, the current study focuses on the role of Medical GIS techniques as an enabler to fight against global pandemic diseases.",

Data divided into two categories first is core data, and the second is subsidiary data. Core data compiled with two parameters in which one is the total number of 25 coronavirus infected cases according to country wise and second is country-wise air passenger's pressure coming from the top ten busy airports of china including Wuhan. Subsidiary data comprises three parameters. The first parameter is the country-wise population density. Population density is an essential parameter for epidemiology. High population density will show a high risk of transmission of disease. According to Merler and Ajelli (27) , influenza 30 activity is affected by the spatial heterogeneity of population density-epidemic reaches much earlier than rural areas. Countries that have large household groups and large fractions of students in the population would face more severe outbreaks (9, 27) . So, we take population density as a first subsidiary parameter. The second parameter consists of country-wise meat consumption. Researchers confirm that coronavirus is a zoonotic virus, so according to Duizer 35 and Koopmans13 when the emergence of CoV is reported or noticed, foodborne transmission should be considered to determine the development and spread of the virus and putting countermeasures into place (13) . The contaminations by live animals or rodents are a possibility because sold animals usually come from various sources in different vendors (13, 19) . The cause may be apparent in the future, but now we take total meat consumption per person as a second 40 subsidiary parameter. The third parameter is the country-wise health care ranking. Country planning, preparedness, and health facilities may play a vital role in preventing an epidemic. It believed that the government of any country would be prepared to act rapidly and effectively to combat an outbreak according to their health facilities. So, we take the health care rank of countries across the globe as a third subsidiary parameter.",

The present situation requires medical GIS data to generate quick responses and investigations for the timely prevention and control of the disease. This requires a rapid source of information about the study of epidemic dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the spatial Ranking of global alertness scale against the spread of COVID 19, based on various parameters related either directly or indirectly, which 35 previous studies ignored. The study focused on five parameters from different dimensions. These parameters further characterized under two categories as core and subsidiary. Core data constituted a total number of coronavirus infected cases and country-wise air passenger's pressure. Subsidiary data formed country-wise population density, country-wise meat consumption, and country-wise health ranking. Based on them, a global scale geospatial index 40 created, and 102 countries were ranked on a scale of 1 to 9 for alertness towards COVID 19 pandemic.

It establishes a strong bond between medical epidemiology and GIS systems to develop, identify, implement, and control mechanisms for efficient decision making for healthcare administrators and professionals. The ability of GIS to link disease information with spatial data makes it an asset in the progression of global healthcare systems (31) . The GIS overlay operations that we used in our research are almost parallel to those used by other 5 scientists, who are working towards the same goal of characterizing the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19. The consensus on our approach provides some support for the validity of our predictions. An added strength of the current study is that the use of five crucial parameters that directly or indirectly influence the possible outbreak rating of pandemic COVID-19.",

We used passenger travel data based on Mao Liang et al. (25) due to financial constraints. If real-time data would have used, the results could be more robust. We also assume that the pandemic spread of disease did not affect passenger's travel behavior. Further, our epidemic forecast based on one of the parameters, i.e., meat consumption data, which might not necessarily reflect the pandemic situation at a larger scale, 15 especially in the occurrence of current public attentiveness and response concerning the health risk posed by of COVID-19. Further parameters related to seasonality, the origin of disease, accounting for airborne transmissibility, could be used as an extension of the study. Worldwide scientists and doctors are trying hard to develop a vaccine to cure the disease in the event of a second wave of infection. One of the current expansions in the fields of Medical GIS is coming 20 from our growing ability to assemble mass amounts of information, known as 'Big Data' that can be helpful with determining urban mobility in case of an emergency evacuation (24, 32, 36) .",
