Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been limited due to factors including high cost and low availability of reagents, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other consumables, and the sheer volume of samples be tested. Factories have been struggling to meet the growing demands for these necessities 1,2 . To date, countries that are able to screen patients swiftly have fared better in containing the COVID-19 outbreak and suppressing the mortality rate associated with the disease 3 . The rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can shed light on transmission patterns and facilitate contact tracing 2,3 . Large scale population screening for COVID-19 infection is generally considered a necessary part of an exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown, and in reinforcing infection control measures in hospitals and among health care workers.",

Negative and positive values of Ct indicates higher and lower sensitivity of pooling, respectively. All 2X ratio pools were positive, with Ct value difference within a range of -1.72 to +1.81 when compared to individual (non-pooled) testing (Table 1) . Statistical paired t-test was calculated to compare the Ct value differences between pooled (including all patterns in Figure 1) Cost effectiveness of the pooling strategy was calculated, based on varying disease prevalence rates (0.1-10%) ( Table 2 ). Pooling appears most cost-effective when testing among populations with lower COVID-19 prevalence. Estimated laboratory costs were reduced from $35 per patient to $3.85, $6.85, $17.54, $26.30 at prevalences of COVID-19 in the tested population of 0.1%, 1, 5%, and 10% respectively. By this estimation, pooledspecimen testing of 1,000,000 subjects in a population with 1% COVID-19 prevalence would save approximately $28.15 million, assuming evenly distributed positive specimens in each pool ( Table 2) .",

The lowest viral concentration used in this study was at Ct 35.49 which was detected from both pooled and individual testing. Ct value more than 35 was considered weakly positive, and the effect of pooling on these samples will need to be further studied. In 2X ratio pooling, RT PCR testing detected higher viral concentrations (lower PCR Ct) compared to those of the corresponding positive specimens when tested individually. This suggests that pooling specimens did not lower the sensitivity of PCR testing but actually increased the viral concentration when more than one positive sample was present in the same pool which combined the viral amount from 2 samples in the same extraction tube. The nucleic extraction system used in this study allowed nucleic acid extraction from 1.0 mL of NT specimens without reducing the sensitivity as compared to 0.1 mL of individual extraction. Further, similar PCR Ct values (within +/-2 Ct; statistically not significant) between pooled and non-pooled specimens indicated there was no interference of PCR inhibitor from 1.0 mL pooled specimens in one extraction tube.",

For example, if 1% of the population is infected, pooling 10 specimens can reduce the cost of laboratory operation by about 80% (Table 2 ). However, in the case of 10% prevalence, pooling specimens will only save 24.87%, as positive pooled samples will need to be individually tested. Thus, this is especially useful in areas with low prevalence rates, or when conducting pro-active surveillance in areas of low infection rate. Proactive surveillance, particularly in asymptomatic cases, remains a challenge to overcome in order to exit lockdown, where screening on a massive scale is required.",
