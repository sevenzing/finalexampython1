Three models are based on the data before lockdown/travel restrictions in these cities, and the other three models are based on data both before and after lockdown/travel restrictions. These models, in general, indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 could be relatively high either for elevated temperatures with lower relative humidity or for lower temperatures with higher relative humidity conditions. Although one model indicates exponential increase in number of infection cases with time, the more statistically significant models show that the number of cases varies quadratically with time. We have discussed in short, how all these features could be linked with the alterations of structural characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, the possibility of natutal disappearance of COVID-19 pandemic, at the global level, has been discussed in the context of the most statistically significant model.",

However, the rate would vary between cities because of their differences of total population, area and population density. Hence, in the present communication a different approach has been followed to study the spreading of COVID-19 by considering homogeneous mixing in the populations of various major cities (Spain, Italy and the USA) along with the meteorological determinants and population density. Under this consideration, the relevant quantity is the proportionate mixing of the number of infected individuals I, within the total population N of a city, denoted as I which is equal to I N . In this work, in the context of infection due to SARS-CoV-2 virus, we have found the relationship between I with temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and time.",

In section 4, the results of the statistical analysis corresponding to various models have been presented with the help of different contour plots, which show the combination of temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity for favourable or unfavourable COVID-19 transmission. Also it has been shown that how the number of infected cases for a particular population, could evolve with time under various meteorological conditions. In section 5 some possible biochemical and biophysical explanation for the stability of the virus under different meteorological conditions (as indicated by the models) have been discussed. In section 6, it has been discussed through illustrative example, how these models indicate the possibility of the world to be free from COVID-19 in a natural way due to the change in the meteorological factors in the environment. Finally, in section 7, based on models, some precautionary measures have been discussed.",

Although these numbers do influence S in the early period of the pandemic (which we are considering), they can be easily ignored because of being relatively much smaller than I. In finding the connection of the spreading of the virus with the meteorological factors and time, the proportionate mixing I = I/N will be considered as a parameter for the spreading of virus and, instead of I, the evolution of the parameter I will be studied in this work. This has the advantage as the upper limit of the quantity I is normalized to unity for a total population N in any city. It is legitimate to assume that the evolution of I depends only on the properties of the virus namely, its' response to different meteorological factors and response to the human host. So to find the evolution of I , one may consider together all the data on the number of infected cases corresponding to different major cities.",

The model assumes that further infections occur due to the direct contact with the infected people and one follows the principle of mass action in chemistry where the proportionate mixing I/N stands for the concentration of some substance. But in the case of viral infections, it should be considered as the contacts of a large number of viruses with the population N to some extent like the scattering of elementary particles. This is because infections will be happening due to virus which could be in the air, which could be on the surface of some material, which could be due to the large number of viruses coming from the sneezing or cough of infected people. Furthermore, viruses coming from one infected person, may infect a large or a few number of people depending on the contacts with the numbers of individuals. That tells that the rate of increase in the number of infected individuals should not be considered to be proportional to the number of already infected persons I. So considering the viral infection problem as the one similar to the law of mass action in chemistry may not be correct and the rate of increase may not be proportional to I/N . In that case, the exponential time dependence which is a solution to I coming from the first order differential equation in I and time T i in which dI dT i is proportional to I, may not be correct. For these reasons, in building up regression models, in the time evolution part of I , we have explored other possible functional forms with time T i as variable. However, we have also explored the possibility of exponential time dependence, although that is not necessarily equivalent to considering that dI dT i is proportional to I and will be explained further in the later part of the paper.",

One can see that \u2202I \u2202T i is increasing linearly with time. However, the gradients of the straight lines corresponding to different models are different. For the chosen temperature and relative humidity, \u2202I \u2202T i for model (B), is always higher than those for the model (A) and (F). As stated earlier in section 3, there is non-zero rate of increase of \u2202I \u2202T i which implies that the increase in I , is associated with some acceleration with time T i. Let us consider the motion of an object with some acceleration, then total displacement of the object is 1 2 f T i 2 with initial zero velocity. If we compare this displacement with I , then acceleration f associated with I could be written as f = 2F 2 . Acceleration is understood from F 1 , however, its magnitude is controlled by the environmental factor F 2 . So the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the temperature, relative humidity and in some models also on wind velocity. If we consider further, the variation of temperature or relative humidity with time T i, then \u2202I \u2202T i will get the further contribution from the second term on the right-hand side of the equation (2). In this case, \u2202I \u2202T i will vary to some extent with T i 2 also and the plots of \u2202I \u2202T i versus T i will show deviations from the straight lines in the above figure. 17 .

Such nature of interaction can be explained by the physicochemical characteristics of respiratory droplets or aerosol and the structural features of the virus itself. The enveloped virus SARS-CoV-2 has a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome which encode four important structural proteins, namely spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), matrix glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). The S glycoprotein is surface exposed and mediates the viral entry into host cells. The S-protein comprises two regions S1 and S2, where S1 is responsible for binding to the receptor of the host cell and S2 is for the fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attaches the host cells through the binding of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 region to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019; Walls et al. 2020) . Although, during infection SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 recognize the same target protein, the pandemic impact of the later happens to be more severe with continuous worldwide increase in the number of infection cases and mortality.",

            "text": "Apart from the increased binding affinity of SARS-COV-2 to ACE2, the severity of COVID-19 can also be determined by the stability of the virus in the environment. Although most of the studies on the effect of meteorological factors on the COVID-19 have speculated the decline in infection with an increase in environmental temperature and humidity (He et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) , the number of infection cases in reality is increasing sharply with the rise in temperature. One may note that this increase at higher temperature is the general feature of all the models in Table I and II particularly for lower humidity. The persistence of the virus at higher temperatures can be explained in the context of the stability of the spike protein because it is a critical component determining the infectivity. A lengthy molecular dynamics simulation of trimeric spike proteins of SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV has shown that the spike protein of SARS-COV-2 has significantly lower total free energy (-67,303 .28 kcal/mol) than the spike protein of SAR-CoV (-63,139.96 kcal/mol) . Similarly, the free energy of the RBD of SARS-COV-2 spike protein is relatively lower than that of SARS-CoV. The results thus explained increased stability of SARS-COV-2 spike protein at higher temperature (He et al. 2020) . Several studies have been carried out on the effect of relative humidity on the survival and infectivity of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses (Benbough 1971; Shaman and Kohn; Pica and Bouvier, 2012; Marr et al. 2019) . When the virus is released into the environment as part of a respiratory fluid droplet, relative humidity of environment controls the amount of water evaporated from the droplet until equilibrium with the surrounding air is maintained/reached (Prussin et al.,",

Moreover, at lower relative humidity and higher temperature the respiratory droplet will undergo evaporation at a higher rate and the desiccated state of droplet will remain unaffected by the changes in temperature, causing higher infection rates. Infection is further enhanced due to more mobility of the smaller droplet size under high temperature and low humidity as such droplets can easily enter the human host. As predicted in this study, the experiments conducted by Prussin et al. (2018) showed that at 37 0 C temperature Phi6, a surrogate of influenza and coronaviruses, had the highest infectivity at 20-40% relative humidity. However, in the same experiment the virus showed a significantly higher level of infection throughout the entire range of relative humidity at lower temperature of 14 and 19 0 C. In our models for such temperature, infection occurs over a wide range of humidity but the level of infection is not very high.",

Probably at higher humidity with appropriate droplet size SARS-CoV-2 could remain wet by keeping it at slightly higher temperature with respect to the lower surface temperature of the droplet and thus remains viable for infection. However, our study indicates a complete reduction in infectivity of the virus under lower temperature and lower humidity condition. Under such condition, probably SARS-CoV-2 virus could not remain wet inside the droplets which are of smaller size and the lipid and 20 .

From Figure 1 Model (B), one can see that at temperature 35 0 C, the number of infected cases is more for relative humidity 40% than that for relative humidity 55 %. So in Figure 5 , there is steeper rise in I during 30 to 35 days than that during 0 to 30 days. The temperature 35 0 C and relative humidity 75% is in the region where viral infections are not viable in Figure 1 Model (B). F 2 is actually negative in this region which should be interpreted as the fall in the spreading of the virus with which I is related. Once the weather is in such no viable region (which can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2 for various models) for the SARS-CoV-2 viral infections for some 10-14 days, one might expect that COVID-19 could go away. In statistical fitting the increase in I has been considered with time T i. In Figure   5 , the period from 35 to 65 days, corresponds to a fall in the spreading of the virus. We have considered that the function F 1 (which indicates the time evolution) and F 2 (which indicates the interactions of virus with the environment), will remain the same even during this period. Figure 5 is an illustrative example of how large cities could be free from COVID-19 in a natural way due to the change in the meteorological factors in the environment.",

In various Figures except the last one, we have not considered the variations of T, H, W with time T i. Although wind velocity appears to be not so significant statistically, but according to Figure 3 Model (F), the higher wind velocity possibly could reduce the transmission of the virus by a small amount as observed in Figure 2 and 3 for Model (F). We have not analysed the data of infected cases where lock-down/travel restrictions have been imposed quite early like the case of India say. But even in such cases, the functional form of F 2 and F 1 in I , should not differ except that some scaling on I should be considered. This scaling will differ from place to place depending on the stringent nature of the restrictions. One may find such scaling by taking the ratio of the expected number of infected cases from the models with total population N after taking into account the time T i and also the variation of various meteorological parameters at different time; to the actual number of infected cases. This could be useful only to estimate approximately the actual number of infected cases in the future. But the general features regarding spreading of the virus as reflected in different figures shown in this work, remain the same. Such scaling should be considered for smaller cities also to understand and estimate approximately the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, where the movement of people are different with respect to large cities.",

The increase in I may be linked with various kind of transmission of the virus. Violent respiratory events like coughs and sneezes help transmitting virus. There could be long-range air-borne transmission of viruses as well as short-range large droplet transmission. Also the virus could be transmitted through direct contact. All these together, will result in an increase in the number of infected persons as well as an increase in I . Comparing with the motion of an object, the transmission of virus could be thought of as the velocity which is initially zero. The reason behind the increase in the rate of increase of I with time is linked with F 2 as discussed earlier. Let us consider the statistically most significant model (B) in which F 2 depends on temperature T and relative humidity H. Our statistical analysis through function F 2 indicates a complex interaction between COVID-19 infection and meteorological parameters.
