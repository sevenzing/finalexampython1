Anti-galactocerebroside staining showed that this cytopathic effect involved the disintegration of oligodendrocytes. A similar effect was produced following infection of myelinating neural cell cultures with rubella virus, but virus multiplication could not be detected in pure neuron cultures. Measles virus was found to multiply and produce a cytopathic effect in primary cultures of both neurons and glial cells. These results are discussed in relation to the ability of measles and rubella viruses to trigger human multiple sclerosis.",

The demyelination occurs in discrete plaques of the CNS, and is immune-mediated. Although it has long been postulated that a virus may be involved in the aetiology of MS, definitive proof of this has not been obtained. It is clear, however, from epidemiological studies, that the event which triggers MS occurs many years before symptoms of the disease become manifest. In the absence of any other plausible hypothesis for the aetiology of MS, the viral theory remains a possibility (Waksman & Reingold, 1986) . One difficulty in establishing a viral connection with MS is that the virus may only trigger the disease, and disappear before biopsy and autopsy specimens are available. It has, however, recently been suggested that one or more of the components of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine may be involved in triggering MS (Alvord, 1989) .",

Other animal models of virus-induced demyelination, such as Theiler's virus infection of mice (Rodriguez, Oleszak & Leibowitz, 1987) and murine coronavirus infection of mice and rats (Buchmeier, Dalziel & Koolen, 1988; Massa, Wege & Ter Meulen, 1986b) , have shown that demyelination is associated with virus persistence. Because of this, work aimed at associating human viruses with MS has centred on this possibility. Our recent work using the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mouse model has indicated that demyelination may persist in the absence of virus persistence (Smyth, Sheahan & Atkins, 1990) . Persistent demyelination may be induced in this way in the SJL mouse strain which carries a T-suppressor defect, and is susceptible to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Lando, Teitelbaum & Amon, 1980; Hood, Steinmetz & Malissen, 1982) .",

For immuno-gold silver staining (IGSS), Lab-Tek 4802 2-chamber tissue culture slides were used (Nunc Inc., Naperville, Illinois, USA). The method used was the indirect staining method described previously (Atkins et al., 1990b) , and gives a yellow, brown or black colouration. Mouse monoclonal antibody to galactocerebroside (anti-GC; Ranscht et al., 1982 ) was a gift of Dr B. Ranscht, La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, California, USA. It was used at a dilution of 1/20. Myelinating cultures were set up as for neurons, but the concentration of cytosine arabinoside was reduced from 10 pg/ml to 5 pg/ml, allowing the survival of some glial cells. multiplication in glial cells was accompanied by slow lysis of a proportion of cells in the culture (see below). For measles virus, a typical cytopathic effect became apparent (Figure 3 ), which eventually affected the whole culture. Some staining of measles-infected glial cells with anti-measles antiserum was possible, but such staining could not be demonstrated for rubella virus. This probably reflected the low infectious virus titres produced by the rubella-infected glial cells (Figure 1 ).",

We have found that omission of cytosine arabinoside inhibits myelination, probably by overgrowth of the culture by protoplasmic astrocytes; reduction in concentration allows the survival of some oligodendrocytes which are able to form myelinated fascicles. Infection of such cultures with rubella virus disrupts the fascicles and leads to the generation of myelin debris.",

            "text": "Based on our previous work with SFV, we postulated that autoimmune demyelination may be induced by presentation of myelin antigens to T-helper lymphocytes through the generation of myelin debris. Such stimulation of T-helper cells may occur by molecular mimicry, that is immune cross-reactions between virus and host components (Oldstone, 1987) . To explain the apparently conflicting evidence and hypotheses regarding MS, we propose the mechanism shown in Figure 7 , which is based on work carried out by many authors and has been proposed before in different forms. Central to this mechanism is the presentation of myelin antigens to T-helper cells in individuals who carry a genetic defect in T-suppressor cell function. Presentation of such antigens could be carried out by macrophages, and possibly also by other cells such as astrocytes. . This antigen presentation occurs in association with type I1 histo-. compatibility molecules, which are recognized by the CD4 receptor on T-helper cells. The expression of type I1 histocompatibility molecules is augmented by the secretion of gammainterferon, which is produced by T-lymphocytes during virus infection in response to antigenic stimulation. The expression of type I1 histocompatibility molecules may also be induced directly by virus infection (Massa, Dorries & Ter Meulen, 1986a) . Although there has been controversy about whether MS patients show immunity to myelin antigens, it has recently been shown that T-helper cells from MS patients proliferate in response to myelin peptides, if these are presented by macrophages in conjunction with HLA-DR (human type I1 histocompatibility) molecules (Baxevanis et af., 1989) . The scheme shown in Figure 7 involves triggering of autoimmune demyelination, and does not assume virus persistence or the involvement of any specific virus or agent. According to this hypothesis, sensitization to myelin antigens may occur by molecular mimicry, or by release of myelin antigens following damage to oligodendrocytes. We have obtained evidence to suggest that rubella virus could trigger autoimmune demyelination by generation of myelin debris (this study), or by molecular mimicry (Atkins et af., 1990a) . We have shown that there is a sequence similarity between the amino-terminal of myelin proteolipid protein, and rubella envelope El protein (Atkins et al., 1990a) . Although the present study does not provide evidence for selective damage to oligodendrocytes by measles virus, there is sequence similarity between measles virus and the same amino-terminal sequence of myelin proteolipid proteins (Atkins et al., 1990a) .",
