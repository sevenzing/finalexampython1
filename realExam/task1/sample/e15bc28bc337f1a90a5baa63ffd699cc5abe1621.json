Physical distancing (also called social distancing) control measures are policies that aim to minimize close contacts within communities and include individual-level (e.g., quarantine, isolation) and community-level (closure of educational and recreational settings, nonessential businesses, and cancellation of public/mass/crowded gatherings) approaches. 7, 8 In Iran, the physical distancing and isolation interventions were scaled up in late February and early March by nationwide closure of schools/universities, cancellation of sports events and Friday/congregational prayers as well as the closure of all non-essential services, tourism sites, and shopping malls (Figure 1 ). Iran also closed its holy shrines in Mashhad and Qom in mid-March. Moreover, while there were no mandatory shelter-in-place or lockdown orders, people were encouraged to stay at home. People were also asked to avoid travelling during the New year Holidays (i.e., Nowruz) from March 19 to 26; however, no restrictions for domestic (via flight, train or bus) or international travels (i.e. no border closure) were imposed. 9 Despite implementing various physical distancing control measures, our understanding of their impact on the magnitude of COVID-19-related new infections, hospitalization, and death remains limited.

A modeling study from China for example, 15 showed that a stepwise (25% of the workforce working in weeks 1 to 2, 50% of the workforce working in weeks 3 to 4, and 100% of the workforce working and school resuming from week 5 forward) return to work or school at the beginning of April (about five months after the first case reported from China), is much more effective than the beginning of March. This study estimated that just a one-month delay in the stepwise lifting of the physical distancing measures would reduce the magnitude (92% by mid-2020, 24% by end-2020) the epidemic and delay its peak by two months and therefore avoid overwhelming the healthcare systems. 15 In Iran, a recent executive order from the government lifted the restrictions on nationwide business shutdown and allowed most people to return to work only 2.5 months after the identification of the first COVID-19 case in Iran. 9, 20 The government has also planned to reopen schools in lowrisk cities and non-essential low or medium-risk jobs (e.g., all production units in industrial, business, technical service, and distributional sections), as well as removing the shelter-in-place order and resuming domestic and international travels. These decisions are mainly derived from the Iranian government's economic challenges that have been elevated by the comprehensive sanctions imposed by the USA. 21,22 While these concerns are understandable and longer shutdown of an already overstretched economy is a tough decision and would be very taxing on the government and the public, our findings as well as lessons learned from China, 15,23,24 suggest that this approach is not justified by evidence and would most likely risk overwhelming the healthcare systems with soon-to-come second and further waves of COVID-19 epidemic in Iran; costs that .

As of April 8, 2020, public hospitals in Iran, which are mainly responsible for the COVID-19 response, had 146,137 beds(9,134  in intensive care units [ICU] and 9,730 ventilators).By discharging inpatient cases and postponing elective medical care and surgeries, Iran has currently allocated 100,437 empty beds, 5,790 empty ICU beds, and 4,650 ventilators towards COVID-19 patients. This might be sufficient for sever COVID-19 patients as predicted by scenario B which would still require appropriate supplies and staffing. As of April 8, 2020, there were 0.41 physician and 1.14 nurse per public hospital bed in Iran. Even under scenario C, the shortage of healthcare workers would be challenging.In addition to individual-and community-level physical distancing control measures that have been implemented in Iran from late February to late March, the number of testing for COVID-19 screening was also increased from 1,000 tests per day on March 12, 2020 to about 10,000 tests per day on April 11, 2020. This has led to an increase in case finding, contact tracing of new cases, and isolation of confirmed cases. Despite the persistent increase in testing, the number of confirmed cases per day peaked at 3,200 on March 30 and then decreased to 1,374 cases per day 18.16  Moreover, measuring the real intensity and coverage of physical distancing in Iran is challenging as these practices have not been closely followed during to the new year (i.e., Nowruz) holidays between March 19 and 26. 17,18 Such a significant increase in travels made the government to enforce physical distancing by closing the roads. While we did account for the Nowruz effect in our model by increasing the number of contacts per day (parameter c) from 5 to 6 from 21 to 31 March, the true effect of Nowruz is still unknown on the current and future projected numbers.Based on the peak time for the number of confirmed cases per day, scenarios C is likely to be the most plausible one for COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. Under this scenario, 10,100 new infections occurred on April 5, which is four times the number of confirmed cases. This scenario expects the total number of infections and deaths by mid-June to be around 950,000 and 17,600, respectively; around four times the number of observed deaths to date (i.e., 5,118 cases by April 19). Our findings however, suggest that scenario B is the most plausible scenario in the Capital city of Tehran which highlights the importance of implementing special measures and policies in this city to reduce the spread of the disease. Our findings in scenario B are comparable with other dynamic model estimations in Iran, 19 that have predicted around 1.6 million (90% UI, 0.9M -2.6M) cases, and 58,000 (90% UI, 32,000-97,000) deaths under their most optimistic scenarios. However, this model had three structural assumptions on three major parameters (i.e., duration of illness as 14 days, asymptomatic period as 4 days, and transmission probability as 0.25 during the asymptomatic period) and did not account for seasonality distribution. 19 Our projections of the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios are insightful for government's policies regarding relaxing the physical distancing and isolation interventions.
