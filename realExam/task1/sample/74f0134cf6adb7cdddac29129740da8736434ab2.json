One of the specimens with discordant results (specimen 3, Table 2 ) was a tracheal aspiration. The package insert of the Xpert Flu assay indicates that nasal aspirates/washes and nasopharyngeal swab specimens can be used for the assay. Therefore, the discordant result in case of specimen 3 might be because a tracheal aspiration is not an appropriate specimen type for testing in the Xpert Flu assay. The Influenza A/B r-gene assay was performed on all available discordant specimens (12/15, 80%) and confirmed the multiplex RT-PCR assay result in all cases. Therefore, the results of the Xpert Flu assay were considered false-negative. The Xpert Flu assay contains an internal control (SPC; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ) that was positive in all discordant specimens excluding PCR inhibition as the reason for false-negative results. A lack of sensitivity of the Xpert Flu assay could be the cause of false-negative results. A finding that supports this hypothesis is that the median Ct value of false-negative specimens was significantly higher than that of concordantly positive specimens (Supplementary Table 1 ). However, sensitivity of the Xpert Flu assay has previously been reported to be higher than 93% compared to another molecular assay (Dugas et al., 2014; Novak-Weekley et al., 2012) . Most of the discordant results in our study were obtained in comparison with the Allplex Respiratory Panel 1 (Table 1) . A possible explanation might be that the Allplex Respiratory Panel 1 is more sensitive than the Anyplex RV16 assay and the assay used in these previously published studies. However, according to the package insert, the sensitivity of the Allplex Respiratory Panel 1 is not higher than that of the Anyplex RV16 assay.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1482, "end": 1502, "text": "(Dugas et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1530, "text": "Novak-Weekley et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 293, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 921, "end": 927, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 932, "end": 952, "text": "Supplementary Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1347, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1651, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Data provided by the manufacturers in the package inserts of the Xpert Flu and the r-gene assays demonstrate that the sensitivity of the assays varies between different influenza virus types and strains. Although the package inserts of the Anyplex RV16 and Allplex Respiratory Panel 1 assays do not mention that the sensitivity of the assays varies between different virus types and strains, it probably is the case. Therefore, differences in sensitivities of the assays to detect certain virus strains may partly explain the discordant results between the Xpert Flu assay and the other assays. Interestingly, in 5 of the discordant specimens there was a difference of 2 Cts or more between the Influenza A/B r-gene assay and the Allplex Respiratory Panel 1. This might also be due to different sensitivities of the two assays for the detection of different influenza virus strains. Failure of an assay to detect a specific virus strain due to mutations in the primer or probe regions has been previously reported (Binnicker et al., 2013) . We cannot rule out that this was the reason for the false-negative results of the Xpert Flu assay because primer and probe sequences are not known to us. However, in the current study, false-negative results were detected for both influenza A and B, therefore our findings do not support the hypothesis that the false-negative results were due to primer or probe mismatches. Furthermore, our analysis of the details of the Xpert Flu assay suggests Table 1 Results of the multiplex RT-PCRs for respiratory viruses and the Xpert Flu assay (cohort A). erroneous automatic interpretation as the main cause of false-negative results. In fact, the detailed analysis of endpoint values and amplification curves suggests that target amplification and detection had occurred in most of the specimens with false-negative results, although the automatic result interpretation indicated \"negative\". Once we had become aware of this problem, we therefore carefully verified the amplification curves (after zooming) and endpoint values of each specimen and reported the specimens with a visible curve as \"weakly positive\" or \"indeterminate\". This approach allowed us to avoid reporting falsenegative results in 9 of the 15 discordant specimens described in the current study. Importantly, since February 2016, this approach was prospectively applied to specimens tested routinely in the Xpert Flu assay only. In total, 16 of 2108 (0.8%) specimens (including the 9 specimens mentioned above) that were interpreted as negative by the automatic result interpretation of the Xpert Flu assay, were reported \"weakly positive\" (n = 7) or \"indeterminate\" (n = 9) by the laboratory physician. However, we did not retrospectively review the amplification curves after zooming of all Xpert Flu assay results performed during the study period (n = 2108). Therefore, we might have missed a number of false-negative results. Taken together, our findings suggest that automatic result interpretation is not completely reliable and could represent a concern in case of use as point of care test. We suggest that the automatic result interpretation should be changed to report \"indeterminate\" instead of \"negative\" in case of amplification curves of low amplitude or slightly elevated endpoints. This would alert the user who could come up with a personal interpretation after careful review of both amplification curves and endpoint data and then decide whether to report the assay result, to perform another assay or to recommend testing a second specimen. The study has the following limitations: testing of respiratory specimens by both techniques was done either if prescribed by the physician in charge of the patient (cohort A, 150/159, 94.3%) or if the laboratory physician in charge of result validation had a doubt about the result of the Xpert Flu assay (cohort B, 9/159, 5.7%). A doubt occurred when an amplification curve was visible or an endpoint value was elevated but the automatic result interpretation indicated \"negative\". Furthermore, a doubt arose when the first specimen yielded a negative result and a second specimen from the same patient yielded a positive result in the Xpert Flu assay. Nine of 22 (41%) and 6 of 9 (67%) multiplex RT-PCR positive specimens yielded negative results in the Xpert Flu assay in cohort A and cohort B, respectively. There is enrichment in discordant results in cohort B. For this reason, results of cohort A and B were presented separately.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1014, "end": 1038, "text": "(Binnicker et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1489, "end": 1496, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, we have analyzed specimens with false-negative results in the Xpert Flu Assay and show that these are mainly due to erroneous automatic interpretation.
