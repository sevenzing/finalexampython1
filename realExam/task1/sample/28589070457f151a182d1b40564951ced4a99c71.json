Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to a high level of uncertainty or even lack of essential data, the standard epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptibleinfected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19 and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are used to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. Based on the results reported here, and due to the complex nature of the COVID-19 outbreak and variation in its behavior from nation-to-nation, this study suggests machine learning as an effective tool to model the outbreak.

Note that definition of various classes of outbreak may vary. For instance, R is often referred to those that have recovered, developed immunity, been isolated, or passed away. However, in some countries, R is susceptible to be infected again and there exists uncertainties in allocating R a value. Advancing SIR-based models requires several assumptions.

The key success of an SIR-based model relies on choosing the right model according to the context and the relevant assumptions. SIS, SIRD, MSIR, SEIR, SEIS, MSEIR, and MSEIRS models are among the popular models used for predicting COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide. The more advanced variation of SIR-d models carefully considers the vital dynamics and constant population [16] . For instance, at the presence of the long-lasting immunity assumption when the immunity is not realized upon recovery from infection, the susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model was suggested [18] .

SEIR models through considering the significant incubation period of an infected person reported to present relatively more accurate predictions. In the case of Varicella and Zika outbreaks the SEIR models showed increased model accuracy [20, 21] . SEIR models assume that the incubation period is a random variable and similarly to the SIR model, there is a disease-free-equilibrium [22, 23] . It should be noted, however, that SEIR models can not fit well where the contact network are non-stationary through time [24] . Social mixing as key factor of non-stationarity determines the reproductive number 0 which is the number of susceptible individuals for infection. The value of 0 for COVID-19 was estimated to be 4 which greatly trigged the pandemic [1] . The lockdown measures aimed at reducing the 0 value down to 1. Nevertheless, the SEIR models are reported to be difficult to fit in the case of COVID-19 due to the non-stationarity of mixing, caused by nudging intervention measures. Therefore, to develop accurate SIR-based models an in-depth information about the social movement and the quality of lockdown measures would be essential. Other drawback of SIR-based models is the short lead-time. As the lead-time increases, the accuracy of the model declines. For instance, for the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, the accuracy of the model reduces from = 1 for the first five days to = 0.86 for day 6 [17] . Overall, the SIR-based models would be accurate if firstly the status of social interactions is stable. Secondly, the class R can be computed precisely. To better estimate the class R, several data sources can be integrated with SIR-based models, e.g., social media and call data records (CDR), which of course a high degree of uncertainty and complexity still remains [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .

More work is required if this technique is adequate in all cases and for different population types and sizes. Nonetheless, the learning approach could overcome imperfect input data. Incomplete catalogs can occur because infected persons are asymptotic, not tested, or not listed in databases. Tests in a closed environment such as large aircraft carriers in France and the US have shown that up to 60% of the infected personnel were asymptomatic. Of course, military personals are not representative of large and mixed populations. Nonetheless, it shows that false negatives can be abundant. In emerging countries, access to laboratory equipment required for testing is extremely limited. This will introduce a bias in the counting. Finally, it is unclear if all the cases are registered. In the UK for example, it took public pressure for the government to make the casualties in retirement hospices known. And there is still doubt in the community that China produced complete data for political reasons. At the same time, national governments and local administrations implemented containment measures such as confinement and social distancing. These actions have a huge impact on transmissions and thus on cases and casualties. Access to modern medical facilities is also a parameter that mainly affects the number of casualties. All these aspects will affect traditional estimation procedures whereas learning algorithms might be able to adapt, especially if multiple datasets are available for a given region. Not only can our approach outperform the commonly used SIR but it requires fewer input data to estimate the trends.

Two scenarios were proposed. Scenario 1 considered sampling the odd days and Scenario 2 used even days for training the data. Training the two machine learning models ANFIS and MLP-ICA were considered for the two scenarios. A detailed investigation was also carried out to explore the most suitable number of neurons. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using both training and validation data. The training data are used to train the algorithm and define the best set of parameters to be used in ANFIS and MLP-ICA. After that, the best setup for each algorithm is used to predict outbreaks on the validation samples. The validation is performed for nine days with promising results which confirms the model accuracy. In this study due to the lack of adequate sample data to avoid the overfitting, the training is used to choose and evaluate the model with higher performance.

Both machine learning models, as an alternative to epidemiological models, showed potential in predicting COVID-19 outbreak as well as estimating total mortality.

Considering the availability of a small amount of training data, further investigation would be essential to explore the true capability of the proposed hybrid model. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no major interruption occurs. For instance, if other outbreaks would initiate in the other cities, or the prevention regime changes, naturally the model will not maintain its accuracy.

The outputs of the first layer imports to the second layer and carries prior values of membership functions (MFs). Fuzzy rules are concluded from the nodes on second layer related degree of activity. The third layer normalizes the degree of activity of any rules. The fourth layer adopts the nodes and function and produces the outputs[87] and send them to the output layer. The important factors for determining the accuracy of ANFIS is the number and type of MFs, the optimum method and the output MF type[88][89][90][91][92].ANFIS model was developed by ANFIS toolbox on MATLAB. Input parameters were independent variables of each scenario and the output variable was the number of cases or mortality rate. The ANFIS model was trained with three triangular, trapoizidal and gaussian MFs. This step was performed in order to select the best MF.
