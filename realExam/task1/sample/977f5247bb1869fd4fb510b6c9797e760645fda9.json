When setting up a surveillance programme, it is important to consider exactly what information is required to avoid collecting data that will not be used, wasting both time and resources. A key purpose of communicable disease surveillance is to detect the occurrence of outbreaks or epidemics so immediate action can be taken to identify and control the source (e.g. outbreaks of food poisoning) or to enable health services to quickly implement emergency plans to deal with an increased number of patients (e.g. during an infl uenza epidemic). Therefore, it is essential that data are collected quickly and efficiently, providing timely information for action (Table 1 ) . Most data are now collected electronically and automatically imported into databases, resulting in improved data quality and timeliness (Buchler 2012 ; Thacker et al. 2012 ) .

Usually, in countries like the UK or the USA, there will be a 2-3-month period during the winter when the level of clinical infl uenza activity rises above the baseline threshold. As well as using data from laboratory confi rmed cases of infl uenza, reports of patients visiting their GP with infl uenza-like illness (ILI) can be used to identify increasing rates of infection ( Fig. 1 ).

To do this, it is essential to have a good understanding of what the surveillance system can and cannot realistically deliver. It is also important to consider timeliness of reporting and representativeness (Noah 2006 ) . Surveillance data generally only represent the tip of the iceberg (Fig. 4 ) . However, the proportion of cases reported is likely to depend on factors such as the severity and duration of disease. For example, most cases of meningococcal meningitis will require treatment and are likely to be reported, while only a small proportion of patients with a foodborne illness will seek healthcare (Somerville et al. 2012 ). However, trends in the proportion of cases that are reported for different conditions generally remain relatively constant over time. When interpreting changes in rates over time, it is important to consider whether any factors have changed within the system, for example, changes in diagnostic testing protocols or an increase in media publicity, etc. which may distort the results. number of cases in different sized groups or populations. However, this type of graph provides very little useful data for policy makers or public health practitioners since it gives no indication of whether these rates vary in different areas of the country or in different groups of the population. To address these issues, the tuberculosis surveillance programme in the UK is an 'enhanced surveillance programme' which collects information on variables such as country of birth and ethnicity, in addition to routine demographic information such as age and sex. This information can be used to help develop policies focusing on improving the health of vulnerable groups. For example, Fig. 5b shows the rates of tuberculosis in two groups of the population: those born in the UK and those born elsewhere (non-UK born). It clearly shows that the rates of infection are over 20 times higher in the non-UK born population than in UK born.

Which age groups are most at risk? Does the severity of symptoms appear to be changing? It can also indicate when the number of cases has peaked. Conversely, syndromic surveillance can also provide reassurance about an absence of incidents during a mass gathering. The main limitation of syndromic surveillance is a lack of specifi city.
