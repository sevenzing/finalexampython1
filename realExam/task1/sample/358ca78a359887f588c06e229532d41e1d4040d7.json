In the early days of the pandemic experts debated whether asymptomatic transmission was possible, a necessary precondition for transmission through transfusion given rigorous donor screening practices [7] . That question; however, is no longer debated as the degree of community transmission in Italy and now New York have accelerated despite symptomatic screening. COVID-19 is characterized by viral shedding which starts during an initial asymptomatic phase that can last more than 14 days, followed by active disease and post-resolution viral shedding that can persist for up to 37 days [7] . Furthermore, findings of viral RNA in multiple bodily fluids tested including blood raises considerable concern regarding the safety of convalescent plasma [8] . From initial reports in patients from Wuhan, China, viremia was found in 6/41 (15%) patients. The median PCR cycle threshold value was 35.1 (95% CI: 34.7-35.1), suggesting a very low RNA concentration in the range between 10 2 to 10 3 copies per mL [8, 9] . Significantly, no difference was observed between patients with severe disease and patients with mild symptoms. Several of these reports have indicated viremia in asymptomatic patients. This may pose particular risk in blood donation due to the potential to escape health screening during donation. In one study, viral RNA was detected in the blood of 96.8% of affected patients [10] . While SARS--CoV, the causative agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have not been documented to cause transfusion-transmitted disease, those pathogens resulted in higher mortality, but lower infectivity due to a lower binding efficiency with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors, respectively. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 binding strength to the ACE2 receptor is higher, suggesting a cause for the greater propensity for human to human transmission [11, 12] .

The current novel coronavirus pandemic exhibits higher viral loads in blood samples and far greater human-to-human spread. Early in the course of the pandemic in the United States, FDA suggested a 28-day deferral for travel-associated risk; however, with over 85 thousand cases at the time of writing and no states free of cases, this strategy is no longer tenable. As a result, decisions have been made to allow donation of convalescent plasma at 28 days post-disease resolution and in absence of antibody at time of donation, although some groups have suggested a relaxation of the testing requirement at donation. Such strategies rely on the comparability of COVID-19 disease to past experiences with SARS and MERS, where transfusion transmission has not been observed. It assumes that similarities in disease behavior and lack of evidence of transfusion transmission in the past cases are relevant to the current situation with SARS-CoV-2. These assumptions could be correct, but it is also important to note that differences in the behavior of this virus, the tissues that it infects, the manifestation of the disease in terms of an asymptomatic phase and transmission characteristics that are different than these prior cases may also suggest that such extrapolation could be flawed.

M.B. Pagano et al. described their experience with adapting to pandemic conditions in Washington State and stated that blood donations fell precipitously as the number of cases rose exponentially [16] .
