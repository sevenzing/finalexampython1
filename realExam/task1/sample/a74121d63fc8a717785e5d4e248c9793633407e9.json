Symptoms and history that can differentiate allergic from nonallergic causes are summarized in Table 1 . Seasonal allergies correspond to pollenosis from wind-pollinated plants, whereas perennial allergies are year-round and caused mostly by indoor allergens. Typically, spring allergens are caused by tree pollen, late-spring and summer symptoms by grass pollen, and fall symptoms by weed pollenosis. Indoor animals, feather pillows containing dust mites, rainfall and humidity-increasing mold exposure, as well as cockroach exposure, all elicit symptoms consistent with perennial allergic rhinitis. Food allergies rarely are a source of allergic rhinitis in adults. Physical findings vary depending on the severity of allergic reaction. The rhinorrhea is typically clear, although occasionally the density of eosinophils and neutrophils imparts a yellow-to-green color to the secretions. The turbinates may appear pale and slightly blue (cyanotic) with clear secretions. A transverse crease may result from a child rubbing the anterior portion of their nose upward (allergic salute). Persistent postnasal drainage may induce lymphoid follicular hyperplasia of the posterior pharynx (cobblestone appearance). Ocular signs vary in intensity from mild conjunctival erythema to marked cobblestoning of the inner eyelids. Edema of the eyelids may occur, especially when the patient rubs the eyes repeatedly. Chemosis occurs as a result of swelling of the limbus around the iris. Finally, \"allergic shiners\" appear as dark circles under the eyes and are caused by vascular congestion of venous drainage of the nose.",

Such false impressions are long-lasting in most patients who desire a diagnosis for their complaints.

Likewise, smokers are reluctant to acknowledge the effect of smoke as an irritant.
