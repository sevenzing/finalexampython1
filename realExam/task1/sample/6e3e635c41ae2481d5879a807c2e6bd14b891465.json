Viruses may also infect cranial or spinal blood vessels leading to ischemic injury. Systemic or CNS infection by viruses or other infectious agents may elicit a host immune response that is crossreactive with components of neural tissue, resulting in encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, injury to peripheral nerves, or optic neuritis.",

            "text": "Before a virus can infect the CNS, it must first breach the cutaneous or mucosal barriers that protect the patient from the outside environment and then penetrate the blood-brain barrier to gain access to susceptible cells in the meninges, brain, or spinal cord. At each step, the virus must infect specific cell populations and produce progeny virus in order to continue the infection. Viruses can enter the body through ingestion, as in enterovirus infections, by the respiratory route, as in influenza or chicken pox, by inoculation across skin, as in arthropodborne encephalitides or rabies, or across mucosal membranes, as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Virtually all viruses capable of infecting the CNS do so via hematogenous spread; exceptions are the rabies virus and herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), all of which travel from the periphery to the CNS within peripheral nerves. Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is transported within nerves during reactivated infection. Infection at the cellular level may occur through several mechanisms. Herpesviruses are taken into the cell following fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell. 1 The human polyomavirus, JC virus (JCV), the etiologic agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), reacts with serotonin and other receptors in this process. 2 Alphaviruses, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus, recognize cell surface laminin and heparan molecules. 3 Viral replication within the host cell may result in various outcomes including lytic infection with cell death; productive infection with budding of viruses across the cell membrane without death of the host cell; or persistent infection, with the virus remaining latent over time. 2, 4 Classic examples of viruses causing latent infection include HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV, all of which persist in sensory ganglia and may reactivate to cause several syndromes including cutaneous lesions and CNS disease. 4 Host response to viral infections initially involves innate immune responses and natural killer cells. Resolution of infection, however, involves both production of antibody and development of specific T-cell-mediated immune responses. Antibody is required to control and clear enteroviruses, and failure of antibody response may result in progressive enteroviral encephalitis. In contrast, immune control of West Nile virus (WNV) involves both B and T cells. 5, 6 Failure of host T-cell response is a major factor in the pathogenesis of PML, as is alteration in CNS T-cell immune surveillance following treatment with the immunomodulatory drug natalizumab in disorders such as multiple sclerosis. 2, 7 CD8 + T cells are important in maintaining HSV and VZV in their latent states and in controlling both primary and reactivated infection. 4 In general, the host immune response is protective, although the inflammatory process that results may augment cerebral edema; however, CNS or systemic infections may also elicit an immune response cross-reactive with antigens to the central or peripheral nervous system, leading to postinfectious neurologic injury.",

            "text": "Acute viral meningitis is most commonly a disease of children and young adults and is the most frequent CNS complication of viral infection. 8 Viral meningitis accounts for an estimated 400,000 hospitalizations yearly in the United States. Major causative agents in Western countries are enteroviruses (accounting for up to 77% of cases), HSV-2 (10 to 20% of cases), and VZV (10 to 20% of cases) (Table 43-1). [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] A minority of cases are caused by WNV or other arthropod-borne agents, HIV, HSV-1, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), or other agents. [13] [14] [15] [16] In northern Europe, cases may be associated with tick-borne encephalitis virus and in southern Europe with Toscana virus. 16, 17 In Asia, Japanese encephalitis virus is a common etiologic agent. 18 In 35 to 50 percent of cases, no agent is identified. 9, 16 The clinical presentation of viral meningitis in adults is similar to that of bacterial meningitis, although patients usually are less acutely ill (Table 43-2) . Onset of meningeal symptoms may be preceded by fever and other symptoms of systemic illness, but viral meningitis often is of abrupt onset with severe headache and nuchal rigidity. 8 Although headache is most commonly the presenting symptom, it may be not be evident in infants and may be less prominent in young children and immunosuppressed individuals. Patients may exhibit photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and, in some cases, irritability and lethargy. Progression to obtundation or coma is rare without accompanying encephalitis. Some patients may have other evidence of systemic viral infection such as pharyngitis or rash, but abnormalities on general physical examination are often absent. Meningeal signs are typically less severe than in bacterial meningitis and may be subtle. The neurologic examination otherwise is usually unremarkable, and the presence of focal neurologic signs should raise concern that some other process is present. 8",

Acute enterovirus infection is usually asymptomatic or may result in mild gastroenteritis or pharyngitis; less than 5 percent of patients will develop meningitis or encephalitis. 19 Enteroviral CNS infection typically causes meningitis rather than encephalitis, with fever, headache, and stiff neck. 19 These symptoms commonly last for 1 to 3 weeks in older children and adults.

WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and California encephalitis virus are transmitted by mosquitoes and tend to be more common in summer and early autumn months. The tick-borne agents Powassan virus and Colorado tick fever virus can cause a rash and most frequently occur during spring and early summer months. An important consideration in patients with suspected Colorado tick fever is the tick-borne rickettsial illness Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which also has a peak incidence in spring and summer, usually has a rash, and requires antibiotic treatment. 31 LCMV is an arenavirus whose natural host is mice but which can cause meningitis and, less frequently, encephalitis in humans. The virus is present in mouse urine and is acquired by the respiratory route. At one time, it was thought to account for roughly 4 percent of diagnosed cases of viral meningitis, but in recent years it has become much less common, for unknown reasons. 15,32 LCMV infections are classically most common in autumn and winter. Occasional outbreaks of infection have been associated with exposure to mice in animal facilities or to pet hamsters or guinea pigs. 15 The meningitis associated with LCMV may be accompanied by low CSF glucose levels, which may persist in cases of prolonged recovery over weeks to months. 33 In neonates, LCMV may cause a fatal systemic and CNS infection. 34 Outbreaks of severe infection with high mortality have also been reported in which LCMV Retrospective diagnosis may be made by comparing antibody titers in acute and convalescent sera or by comparing serum:CSF ratios of antibody against those of other agents. c Diagnostic methods for common agents such as HSV-1, HSV-2, enteroviruses, West Nile virus, and varicella zoster virus are readily available through many hospital and commercial laboratories. Advice concerning less usual infections may be obtained through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. d Less frequent forms of illness are shown in parentheses. e Not available in the United States. f HSV-2 meningitis may occur as a single event but may also be recurrent and is the major cause of Mollaret meningitis. g Mild cases of HSV-2 meningitis may not require treatment. Severe HSV-2 meningitis may require treatment with acyclovir. Treatment of recurrent HSV-2 meningitis may employ valacyclovir. has been transmitted by organ transplantation. 35, 36 Reliable antiviral therapy for LCMV infection is not available; one patient with transplant-acquired LCMV infection recovered after reduction of the patient's immunosuppressive regimen and treatment with ribavirin. 35 Mumps virus, once a major cause of meningitis worldwide, is now rare in developed countries but remains a significant cause of meningitis in areas where mumps immunization is not practiced. 37 The virus has caused occasional epidemics in Western countries in unvaccinated populations exposed to individuals who have visited areas where mumps is still prevalent. [37] [38] [39] Human Immunodeficiency Virus CNS invasion occurs early in the course of primary HIV infection, and meningitis due directly to HIV occurs in 9 to 24 percent of patients (see Chapter 44) . 40, 41 The meningitis usually develops near the time of seroconversion and often occurs in the setting of an acute, mononucleosis-like retroviral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy; CNS findings of disorientation, confusion, or psychosis accompany this syndrome in some patients. 40 Primary HIV meningitis should be considered in young adults with meningitis, particularly when they have HIV risk factors or a coexistent mononucleosis-like syndrome. The symptoms of meningitis are usually not severe and resolve in most but not all cases; in some patients, HIV meningitis becomes chronic. 40 The CSF typically reveals a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein content, and normal glucose level. 40 Standard serologic tests for HIV (as well as tests for home use) are negative in many patients with this acute syndrome; serologic tests first become positive 22 to 27 days after onset of acute infection. 41 The diagnosis of acute HIV meningitis is made by detecting viral RNA or viral p24 antigen in serum or plasma; the viral RNA usually becomes detectable 3 to 5 days prior to the detection of p24 antigen and is typically present in copy numbers greater than 50,000 copies/ml. 41 Treatment of HIV is with antiretroviral therapy, and follow-up assay for antiviral antibodies is used to confirm the diagnosis. In approaching patients with suspected HIV meningitis, it must be kept in mind that lymphocytic meningitis in patients with HIV infection may be caused by a wide variety of other agents, many of which are treatable. 40",

Because asymptomatic enterovirus infections are common in the summer months, enterovirus isolation from throat or stool does not make a definitive diagnosis of enterovirus meningitis. In one study, use of an enterovirus PCR assay in the emergency department in children with aseptic meningitis resulted in significantly less antibiotic use, shorter length of hospitalization, and lower hospital costs. 42 Although it is the diagnostic study of choice in many viral meningitides, CSF PCR may be negative early in the disease course, and diagnostic yield may be highest when CSF is obtained within 3 to 14 days of onset of meningitis. 43 In certain instances, the detection of CSF immunoglobulins may have greater diagnostic sensitivity than PCR. This is the case in WNV neuroinvasive disease and other arbovirus infections, in which detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) is more sensitive than PCR. 33 Similarly, detection of virus-specific IgG in CSF may prove diagnostic in infections due to protracted or reactivated VZV where PCR is negative. 44 Identification of the causative agent in viral meningitis may be made retrospectively by detecting a rise in IgG antibody titers between acute and convalescent (obtained after 3 to 6 weeks) serum or, at times, by detecting an abnormal serum:CSF ratio of antiviral antibodies.",

            "text": "Viral meningitis is sometimes referred to by the older term \"aseptic meningitis.\" This term, however, subsumes a broad range of clinical entities characterized by a meningeal reaction but distinct from purulent bacterial meningitis. It may include not only viral meningitis but also infections by bacteria that are not readily detected in routine cultures (Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), meningeal involvement by Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, or Anaplasma, and infection by parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii. The possibility of infection by one of these agents should be kept in mind in a patient with suspected viral meningitis, since all are amenable to antibiotic treatment. In particular, Borrelia burgdorferi can be a major cause of lymphocytic meningitis in endemic areas (see Chapter 40) . 45, 46 Aseptic meningitis may also be associated with a variety of pharmacologic agents including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, augmentin, carbamazepine, intravenous immunoglobulin G, and the murine monoclonal antibody OKT3. 47, 48 Treatment of viral meningitis is supportive in most cases. Analgesics may be required for individuals with severe headaches, and antiemetics for those with considerable nausea and vomiting. Hospitalization is seldom required except when vomiting is severe enough to cause dehydration or when bacterial meningitis cannot be excluded. Acyclovir and valacyclovir have been used to shorten the duration of illness in acute meningitis due to HSV-2 and VZV (Table 43-3) . 49 However, controlled studies do not exist, and no standardized regimen has been developed. 24, 50 Patients with recurrent HSV meningitis may wish to keep oral acyclovir or valacyclovir at home and take the drug at the onset of meningeal symptoms. Ongoing twice daily treatment with valacyclovir at a dose of 0.5 mg has not been shown to prevent recurrence, but higher dosages were not studied. 25 The antiviral agent pleconaril, which prevents uncoating of viral RNA, has been used in enteroviral meningitis but is not routinely available in the United States. 51, 52 As a group, patients with viral meningitis generally make a complete recovery within 1 to 2 weeks. Not all patients recover this quickly, however, and symptoms such as fatigue may last for weeks or even months. CSF abnormalities may also persist for well beyond the initial period of recovery. 33 In addition, there have been occasional reports of permanent sequelae, usually but not always in small children, including cognitive impairment, deafness, and cranial nerve palsies. [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] Aqueductal stenosis with hydrocephalus is a rare complication of HSV-2 and mumps meningitis. 58, 59 VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS Viral encephalitis is caused by viral infection of cells within the brain parenchyma (Table 43-4 ). The cell populations in which viral replication occurs differ among the various viruses and may involve neurons, glia, or, at times, vascular endothelial cells. The result of the infection may be death of specific cell populations or more widespread destruction involving multiple cell types. Viruses affecting unique populations of cells include rabies, which infects neurons exclusively; poliomyelitis, which involves spinal and other motor neurons; and JC virus, which causes lytic infection almost exclusively in oligodendrocytes. Viruses infecting multiple cell types, often with extensive parenchymal destruction, include HSV and agents of the arthropodborne encephalitides. Parenchymal destruction in severe infections such as herpes simplex encephalitis may be accompanied by hemorrhage. Virtually all viral encephalitides are accompanied by some degree of meningeal inflammation and cerebral edema, the latter of which may be severe enough to cause death. 60, 61 Viral encephalitis occurs worldwide, with a particularly high incidence in the tropics. ( and women equally, and may occur at any age. 63, 66 Immunosuppression does not increase the risk of encephalitis, but the course may be atypical in these individuals. 67, 68 The virus has a predilection for orbitofrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which it may involve unilaterally or bilaterally. 63 The cingulate cortex is also involved in many patients. Occasionally herpes simplex encephalitis involves the occipital cortex or brainstem, in rare cases without temporal lobe involvement. 69 Vascular congestion and petechial or larger hemorrhages may be present; progression of the infection results in extensive and frequently hemorrhagic destruction of brain. 70 Herpes simplex encephalitis presents with an almost universal triad of headache (in over 90% of cases), fever, and alteration in mental state. 20, 63 Changes in mental state at presentation may range from confusion, frank psychosis, or somnolence to stupor or coma. Temporal lobe involvement may be manifested by olfactory or gustatory hallucinations, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu phenomena, and upper quadrant visual field defects. 63 Bilateral temporal involvement may result in the loss of ability to store and recall new information, and involvement of the dominant hemisphere can result in aphasia. Rare patients present with symptoms and signs referable to the occipital lobes. 71 Focal or generalized seizures may occur at any point during the acute illness or after recovery.",

Complications of acyclovir therapy are usually mild. The major concern is nephrotoxicity due to deposition of drug crystals, which can be avoided by careful hydration. Although acyclovir resistance has been reported in other conditions, acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex encephalitis is rare. 78, 79 Prior to the introduction of acyclovir, overall mortality from herpes simplex encephalitis was over 70 percent, with mortality approaching 100 percent in patients over the age of 40 years. 80 The advent of acyclovir has reduced the overall mortality to 28 percent, and instituting antiviral therapy at presentation when the diagnosis is suspected has reduced 1-year mortality to 14 percent. 81 Patients who are A B alert or lethargic when treatment is initiated have an excellent likelihood of survival, but mortality in patients treated when semicomatose or comatose still approaches 25 percent. 63 The likelihood of death or serious neurologic impairment is greater when the patient is elderly, initiation of acyclovir treatment is delayed, or evidence of extensive CNS involvement is present on initial neuroimaging. Even with prompt initiation of treatment, up to two-thirds of patients are left with permanent neurologic deficits including epilepsy, impaired cognition, aphasia, anterograde amnesia, or motor deficits. 63, 81, 82 Neurologic improvement takes place over months, and some patients who are severely impaired immediately after treatment have a good functional recovery over time.",

            "text": "VZV, like HSV, is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that is worldwide in distribution. The virus is acquired by the respiratory route and replicates initially in tonsillar tissue to produce a viremia followed by seeding of multiple tissues including skin. Primary infection classically results in chicken pox, but individuals may also be infected acutely with little or no rash. Virus is then taken up by nerves supplying infected skin or other tissues and is transported to sensory ganglia, establishing lifelong persistence. 83 VZV thus differs from HSV in that it produces an acute viremic illness and only then persists secondarily and spreads within neurons. Viral latency in sensory ganglia is heavily controlled by T-cell-mediated immunity, and reactivation of infection may occur with waning of immune response during old age or in states of compromised host immunity. 83 Cutaneous zoster (shingles), the most common manifestation of reactivated VZV infection, affects roughly 1 million adults in the United States annually. 83 The likelihood of developing zoster is higher in individuals who acquired chicken pox during infancy. 83 Most cases of zoster occur in patients older than 50 years. Neuropathologic correlates of cutaneous zoster include focal meningeal inflammation, necrosis of associated neurons, and degeneration of motor and sensory nerve roots in the involved area. 83 Cutaneous zoster may develop without known precipitating cause or may be triggered by systemic cancer, spinal irradiation, HIV infection or other immunosuppressed states, or spinal trauma. 83 Many patients experience a sharp, burning discomfort in a dermatomal distribution for 2 to 5 days before onset of the rash. A localized redness with red macules then develops and progresses to vesicles in the same dermatomal pattern as the pain. 83 Additional vesicles may appear over the next 2 to 7 days. The distribution of herpes zoster is usually unilateral and involves a single dermatome. The rash involves the trunk in 50 percent, the head in 20 percent, the arms in 15 percent, and the legs in 15 percent of cases. Over the next month, the dermatomal pain slowly disappears, leaving residual hypoalgesia or hyperalgesia. Occasional patients may present with dermatomal pain without rash, termed zoster sine herpete. 83 Treatment with oral valacyclovir (1 gram three times daily for 7 to 10 days) shortens the duration of rash and acute pain. 83, 84 Recommended treatment in immunocompromised individuals is 5 to 10 mg/kg of usually intravenous acyclovir given three times daily for 5 to 7 days. 83 Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)-pain occurring in the distribution of the original rash and persisting for longer than 3 months-occurs in 9 to 14 percent of patients following shingles and increases with advancing age. 85 The pain may be relentless, episodic, or paroxysmal and may be elicited by cutaneous contact or stimulation. Postherpetic itch is also common. The live attenuated Oka strain VZV vaccine has been shown to reduce the incidence of cutaneous zoster in healthy individuals by 50 percent and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by 67 percent. 86 To what extent antiviral treatment of acute zoster lessens the likelihood of PHN has not been clearly demonstrated. 84 Symptomatic treatment of PHN is often disappointing. Tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, controlled-release morphine sulfate, oxycodone, and lidocaine patches have moderate to high efficacy, but are sometimes completely unhelpful. 87 Aspirin in cream or ointment form, topical capsaicin, and intrathecal methylprednisolone are less effective, limited by side effects, or both. 87 For most of these medications, treatment involves escalating dosages of medication until pain relief is achieved or unacceptable side effects occur.",

            "text": "VZV may invade the CNS during primary or reactivated infection and, in reactivated infection, may do so in the absence of cutaneous zoster. 88 Prior to the advent of PCR testing, CNS invasion by VZV was considered unusual. It is now realized, however, that CNS involvement by VZV is much more frequent; in one series VZV was found to be the most common agent identified in viral meningitis and encephalitis (29% of isolates). 88 Studies from France and England have identified the agent in 5 to 15 percent of encephalitis isolates. 89, 90 The virus is now known to cause a wide range of syndromes of neurologic injury involving not only brain and spinal cord but also cranial nerves and brainstem or peripheral ganglia. 88 CNS invasion in reactivated VZV infection occurs following spread of virus from trigeminal or spinal sensory ganglia; in this process, the virus may produce ophthalmic involvement or may produce Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, in which infection of the tympanic membrane and surrounding structures is accompanied by facial nerve palsy. 88 Of greater concern and unlike HSV, VZV may infect both large and small vessels supplying the brain or spinal cord, at times followed by spread of the infection into neural parenchyma. 88, 91 Involvement of vessels may produce focal or multifocal ischemic injury or may cause vessel-wall necrosis with resulting arterial dissection, aneurysm formation, or hemorrhage within the subarachnoid space or brain parenchyma. 88 The classic presentation of VZV vasculopathy is herpes zoster ophthalmicus, in which there is initial superficial zoster in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve followed days to weeks later by stroke in the territory of the carotid or middle cerebral artery. 88 However, VZV vasculitis may occur with or without preceding cutaneous zoster or herpes zoster ophthalmicus or oticus and may involve virtually any vascular territory within the brain or spinal cord. VZV vasculitis may be significantly more severe in HIV infection or other immunosuppressed states, and immunosuppressed patients may develop a more slowly progressive CNS vasculopathy or myelitis. 88 CSF in acute VZV CNS infection may reveal a mononuclear pleocytosis, at times with red blood cells and sometimes hypoglychorrhachia. 33, 88 VZV encephalitis in the setting of acute VZV infection may be diagnosed by PCR; however, the reaction rapidly becomes negative, so a negative PCR does not exclude the diagnosis. 88 Diagnosis of VZV vasculopathy in the setting of reactivated infection may also be made by the presence of elevated titers of anti-VZV IgG antibodies in CSF. 83, 88 Oligoclonal bands are commonly present and are reactive with VZV proteins. 88 Treatment of VZV encephalitis is with acyclovir, 10 mg/kg, usually intravenously, every 8 hours for a minimum of 14 days. Oral prednisone, 1 mg/ kg, given daily for 5 days, may be used to treat the inflammatory component of the vasculitis; more prolonged treatment is avoided to prevent steroidinduced immunosuppression. 88",

            "text": "WNV, a single-stranded RNA flavivirus virus, is currently the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis in the United States. 92, 93 The virus infects multiple species of animals and birds, in particular crows, jays, magpies, and ravens. Culex species mosquitoes, predominantly C. tarsalis and C. pipiens, are the primary vectors for human infection. WNV produces infection predominantly in the summer and early autumn, when mosquitoes are most active. As of December 2012, 5,387 cases of WNV infection had been reported to the CDC for the year, with 243 deaths (Fig. 43-2 ). Of these cases, 2,734 (51%) represented neuroinvasive disease (Fig. 43-3) . In most individuals, WNV infection is silent or produces only trivial symptoms. In 20 percent of infected patients, symptomatic West Nile fever develops, characterized by malaise, fatigue, anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, fever, eye pain, and a nonspecific maculopapular rash. 92 The illness usually lasts less than 7 days, although a minority of patients may remain symptomatic for as long as 6 weeks. 92 Less than 1 percent of infected patients develop neuroinvasive disease, which is more common in the elderly and is especially severe in immunosuppressed patients or transplant recipients. 92, 94 West Nile encephalitis typically presents with fever, headache, and altered mental state, stupor, or coma. Other signs of parenchymal involvement may include cerebellar ataxia or movement disorders including tremor, myoclonus, and parkinsonian symptoms. 94, 95 WNV infection may also result in a syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis similar to that seen with polio virus. 94,95 A minority of patients develop chorioretinitis or vitritis. 96 CSF in neuroinvasive WNV infection typically shows a mild elevation in opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, mild elevation of protein level, and normal glucose concentration. Cell count is usually 50 to 260 cells/mm 3 but may be as high as 2,600 and may be heavily polymorphonuclear, in particular at presentation. 33, 95 In one series, cell count was normal in 20 percent of patients. 97 Occasional patients have low serum sodium levels indicative of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). MRI is often normal, although a minority of patients have areas of increased signal on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences in the substantia nigra, basal ganglia, and thalamus. 98, 99 Patients with WNVinduced flaccid paralysis may show increased signal in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. 99 acute, cerebrospinal fluid specimen positive for WNV-specific IgM antibodies is diagnostic of WNV neuroinvasive disease. 98 PCR is less reliable. Paired sera positive for WNV-specific IgM antibodies (a fourfold or greater rise in titer from the \"acute\" serum, obtained 0 to 7 days after symptom onset, and the \"convalescent\" serum, obtained 14 to 21 days after symptom onset) also provide serologic confirmation.",

Cases of St. Louis encephalitis have been reported from almost every area of the United States, but the majority occur in the central Midwest and Texas. The virus is usually seen with scattered rural infections but may also cause urban epidemics. St. Louis encephalitis resembles neuroinvasive West Nile disease but rarely if ever produces a flaccid, polio-like illness. 101 The two diseases are both more severe in the elderly and they have similar CSF findings. Diagnosis of St. Louis encephalitis is either by CSF IgM, by a rise in antibody titers, or both. Eastern equine encephalitis virus is an agent of wading and migratory birds that is found predominantly along the Atlantic seaboard, the Gulf of Mexico, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. 101, 102 Although the virus does not usually produce severe infection in its natural hosts, it can infect horses and may cause epizootic outbreaks of infection in flocks of turkeys or in exotic or game farm birds. Eastern equine encephalitis is rare in humans, with approximately 5 cases occurring annually. 101, 102 The virus is most apt to cause encephalitis in infants and in individuals over 55 years of age. A prodromal illness which may include fever, headache, and abdominal pain frequently occurs. 103 Onset of encephalitis may be fulminant: nearly 70 percent of patients present in stupor or coma, and presentation only with meningeal symptoms is uncommon. 103 Corticospinal or extrapyramidal signs are often present, and the illness may be complicated by focal or generalized seizures. Overall mortality is around 35 percent, with one-third of survivors suffering significant neurologic impairment. 103 Two groups of arthropod-borne infections occur outside the United States and should be considered when evaluating patients with encephalitis coming from endemic areas (Table 43-1) . Tick-borne encephalitides relate to multiple viral agents existing throughout Eurasia, with greatest prevalence in northern Europe and Asia. 104 Japanese encephalitis virus, endemic in eastern and southeastern Asia, results in 15,000 deaths annually. 18 Both tick-borne encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis may present with findings similar to those produced by WNV, including flaccid paralysis. 17, 18 ",

Rabies virus exists worldwide and predominant reservoirs are bats, skunks, foxes, and raccoons in developed countries where there is mandatory rabies vaccination for dogs. 105 Mostbut not all-human cases acquired in the United States have resulted from bat bites. 105 In less developed countries, dogs are the source of most human cases; other animals including infected monkeys, sometimes kept as pets, may account for a minority of cases. 105, 106 Rabies virus is typically acquired through the bite of an infected animal; rare cases have occurred following exposure to aerosolized rabies virus or after inadvertent transplantation of infected tissue. 105, [107] [108] [109] The virus may remain latent at the site of an infected bite for 6 or more years before the onset of neurologic disease. 110 Unlike most other viruses causing encephalitis, rabies is specifically neurotropic: the virus enters peripheral nerve fibers at the site of inoculation, is carried proximally by reverse axoplasmic flow, and progressively infects the CNS through neuron-to-neuron spread (the centripetal phase of infection). The virus then spreads outward within nerves (the centrifugal phase of infection) to involve multiple tissues including salivary glands, corneas, and the heart. In animals, this centrifugal phase of infection, with shedding of salivary virus, may occur prior to clinical disease. 106, 111, 112 Rabies classically begins with dysesthesias at the site of the bite, followed by progressive neurologic involvement with a clinical picture (termed \"furious rabies\") of agitated delirium, stimulus-sensitive laryngeal spasm with hydrophobia, prolonged inspiratory spasm, and progression to coma and death. 105 Rabies may also present as a more classic encephalitis with stupor and coma (\"dumb rabies\"), or as an ascending paralysis, similar to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, followed by signs of CNS involvement. 105 Rabies should be considered in appropriate clinical settings, in particular when there is a history of animal bite or of recent or remote travel to, or residence in, countries where rabies is a significant health problem. There may no history of bite, however; the minute punctures caused by bat bites may go unnoticed, or, alternatively, the animal bite may have occurred long enough ago to have been forgotten. 110, 113 MRI may show ill-defined, mild T2-hyperintensities in the brainstem and hippocampus; early in the disease these lesions may fail to enhance with gadolinium. 114 Specific diagnosis of rabies is made by identifying rabies antigen in nuchal biopsy or by PCR from saliva or CSF.",

[126] [127] [128] The association of EBV with specific disease presentations, however, is made difficult by two properties of the virus. First, EBV infects and can remain latent in B lymphocytes for many years. For this reason, PCR amplification of EBV DNA from CSF in patients with suspected CNS infection may simply indicate the presence of the virus in lymphocytes rather than proving it as a causative agent. Second, like HSV, EBV can reactivate under situations of physiologic stress, so that a rise in antibody titer in the setting of acute illness may or may not be indicative of disease causation.",

In untreated AIDS, however, 4 percent of patients will die of PML, which can be the presenting feature. 144 In recent years, PML has become increasingly frequent in patients treated with the more aggressive immunosuppressive regimens now used for collagenvascular diseases and solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 145 PML has also become a significant-although infrequent-complication of treatment with natalizumab and other monoclonal immunosuppressive agents such as rituximab, efalizumab, alemtuzumab, and TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors. 146 The course of PML is that of the progressive development of multifocal neurologic deficits that may involve motor control, sensation, speech, vision, or cognition. Occasional patients develop cerebellar or brainstem signs, but clinical involvement of the spinal cord is virtually never present. Rarely AIDS patients have been reported to develop JCV infection of cerebellar granule or other neurons. 147 PML is presumptively diagnosed by MRI, which typically shows multifocal white matter lesions in the cerebrum or, less often, brainstem or cerebellum (Fig. 43-4) ; PML lesions are often not apparent on CT. Although PML lesions usually do not enhance, gadolinium enhancement may occur in AIDS-and natalizumab-associated PML. 2,148 A definitive diagnosis of PML is made by PCR amplification of JCV DNA from the CSF. 2,33 Sensitivity of PCR in early studies approached 80 to 90 percent. 149 However in HIV patients treated with antiretroviral therapy, PCR is positive in only 58 percent of cases 150 .",

Signs indicating temporal lobe involvement suggest herpes simplex encephalitis, but other viral encephalitides may have a similar presentation as may occasional bacterial infections or autoimmune encephalitis from antineuronal antibodies. Patients often have an elevated peripheral white blood cell count, but signs of systemic infection may also be absent. Diagnosis relies heavily on clinical findings, MRI, and the results of CSF analysis. MRI in herpes simplex encephalitis characteristically shows abnormalities of one or both temporal lobes, at times with involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, or cingulate gyrus. Similar findings, however, may be seen in other potentially treatable conditions including neurosyphilis and autoimmune encephalitis. 155, 156 The CSF in viral encephalitis typically shows significant pleocytosis and an elevated protein but normal glucose concentration. The pleocytosis is commonly lymphocytic, but is neutrophilic in rare cases. 33 A depressed CSF glucose level, while not typical, has been described in VZV, LCMV, mumps, and HSV-2 infections. 33 CSF should be sent for PCR for HSV, and consideration should be given to ordering PCR for other agents. Detection of virus-specific IgM in CSF is more sensitive than PCR for the diagnosis of WNV and may be useful in other arboviral infections where PCR is negative. Similarly, elevated CSF titers of IgG may be more sensitive than PCR in encephalitis due to reactivated VZV. Lumbar puncture may need to be deferred when there is evidence on examination, CT, or MRI of increased intracranial pressure or mass lesion.",

            "text": "Prion diseases represent a group of rare disorders including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), new variant CJD (vCJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Schenker disease, familial fatal insomnia, kuru, and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. 158, 159 Prion diseases of animals include scrapie of sheep (the prototype for this group of conditions), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, wasting disease of deer and elk, and transmissible mink encephalopathy. 159 Prion diseases are not caused by viruses but rather by a self-replicating isoform of a normal intracellular sialoglycoprotein. The normal cellular protein is termed \"PrP(c)\" and the self-replicating protein causing disease is referred to as \"PrP(Sc).\" PrP(Sc) does not contain nucleic acid, its presence does not elicit an immune response, and it is not inactivated by many agents normally used for decontamination. 159, 160 Interaction of PrP(Sc) with PrP(c) appears to be essential for disease. 159, 160 Except in familial cases, PrP(Sc) is thought to arise from a spontaneous mutation in PrP(c). Several different subtypes of CJD have been associated with homozygosity or heterozygosity of methionine or valine at codon 129 of the PrP gene, differences in variation in glycosylation patterns of PrP(Sc), and patterns of electrophoretic mobility of PrP(Sc) after proteinase K digestion. 159, 160 Prion diseases have repeatedly been shown to be transmissible through PrP(Sc)-contaminated material, including PrP(Sc)containing human grafts of dura mater or other tissues, contaminated electrodes used for intracerebral recording, and human pituitary-derived growth hormone. In the case of vCJD, transmission has occurred predominantly through ingestion of contaminated beef, but it has also occurred through blood transfusion. 159, 161 The most common human prion disease is CJD, which occurs worldwide with 1 to 2 cases per million population per year. 159 The average age at onset is 60 years, with an equal gender distribution. Most cases are sporadic (sCJD), but 12 percent cluster in families. 159 The condition affects the CNS only, without systemic symptoms. The onset of CJD is typically with subtle changes in cognition and personality changes that may include apathy, irritability, depression, or paranoia. 159 Occasional patients present with ataxia, spasticity, or visual complaints. These initial symptoms are followed by progressive dementia, often involving parietal lobe symptoms and, at times, aphasia. As the disease progresses, over 85 percent of patients develop stimulus-sensitive myoclonic jerks that tend to disappear as the disease progresses to profound dementia and a vegetative state. CJD is untreatable, and its course is relentlessly progressive, resulting in death within 6 months to 2 years. 159 The diagnosis of CJD is made on the basis of clinical presentation, EEG, MRI, and evaluation of CSF for the proteins 14-3-3, tau, and neuron-specific enolase. The yield of these studies, however, varies among the different subtypes of CJD. 162 CSF cell count and protein levels are usually normal, such that significant pleocytosis suggests strongly that the diagnosis is incorrect. The EEG initially may show only mild slowing but subsequently becomes strikingly abnormal, with repetitive, periodic, stereotyped, bilaterally synchronous sharp waves that usually occur at a frequency of 1 to 2 per second and are often associated with myoclonic jerks. 163, 164 This periodic EEG activity may give way to generalized slowing late in the disease. 163, 164 MRI has become the major diagnostic test in suspected CJD and typically shows foci of increased signal in the putamen, caudate, thalamus, and gray matter of the cerebral cortex. These findings are most prominent on diffusion-weighted sequences and, with less sensitivity, FLAIR sequences ( Fig. 43-6) ; MRI changes are not reliably present in familial CJD. 165 Detection of 14-3-3 and tau proteins as well as neuron-specific enolase in CSF provides supportive evidence for the presence of CJD in patients with clinical, EEG, or MRI markers of the disease. 166 None of these CSF markers is specific for CJD, however, and their use in unselected patients may lead to erroneous diagnosis. 166 Postmortem diagnosis can be made by the characteristic brain histopathology and staining with specific prion antibodies or by demonstration of prions from homogenized brain using immunodiagnostic procedures.",

In contrast to the general population, all patients studied with vCJD have been homozygous for methionine at codon 129 of the PrP gene.

            "text": "Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is defined as an acute, monophasic demyelinating illness occurring (Table  43 -5). The condition bears strong similarity to two other conditions: postvaccination encephalomyelitis, which follows immunization (see Chapter 48) , and the experimental autoimmune demyelinating disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). 169, 170 Postinfectious encephalomyelitis and postvaccinal encephalomyelitis have been grouped under the common term acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which is therefore a final common pathway of autoimmune CNS injury that may be produced by a variety of infectious agents or immunizations. 169, 170 Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is more common in children than in adults and is rare in the elderly. In children, the peak age of onset is 5 to 8 years. The onset of postinfectious encephalomyelitis may be preceded by fever, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, or combinations of these symptoms. These prodromal symptoms are followed by the abrupt-at times fulminant-onset of CNS dysfunction. Altered mental state is almost universal and may range from drowsiness to frank coma. Meningeal signs are common. Neurologic examination may reveal unilateral or bilateral corticospinal tract signs, hemiplegia, ataxia, aphasia, sensory loss, visual field defects, or cranial nerve palsies. Focal or generalized seizures occur in up to 70 percent of children under 5 years of age, 80 percent of whom may develop status epilepticus. 171 Occasionally, postinfectious encephalomyelitis may be accompanied by optic neuritis or by involvement of the peripheral nervous system. The simultaneous occurrence of central and peripheral demyelinating events appears to be more common in adults than children. 172 A syndrome of ataxia may be seen in patients following chicken pox or, less frequently, other viral infections. 173 The presence of multifocal neurologic signs should raise the level of suspicion of ADEM, as should the presence of signs referable to both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system. Excluding active nervous system infection is important. CSF typically shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis; however, roughly 30 percent of patients will have a mixed pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance. 174 Traditionally, the presence of oligoclonal bands was considered unusual; in one study, however, oligoclonal bands were detected in 20 percent of patients with ADEM. 175 In a longitudinal study, oligoclonal bands were reported in 65 percent of individuals presenting with illnesses initially diagnosed as ADEM, but over 50 percent of these patients were subsequently diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. 176 MRI with gadolinium enhancement is the diagnostic study of choice in ADEM. T2 and FLAIR sequences classically show multiple, large, asymmetric, irregularly shaped lesions involving subcortical white matter and the gray-white junction of both cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 43-7) . 176 Periventricular white matter may be involved, but lesions confined to the corpus callosum are unusual, in contrast to multiple sclerosis. 172 Gadolinium enhancement is seen in 30 to 100 percent of patients and may vary with stage of the disease. 171 Ringenhancing lesions are sometimes found but should raise particular concern regarding brain abscess or other active CNS infection. 172 Spinal cord involvement, usually with extensive edema and swelling, may occur in children or adults and has a predilection for the thoracic region. 172 The majority of these lesions will resolve over time. 172",

Symptoms typically include fever, back and leg pain, muscle weakness, sensory disturbances, and sphincter dysfunction. Neurologic examination may demonstrate corticospinal tract signs and level-specific sensory loss. The patient may initially exhibit flaccid weakness that progresses over weeks to spasticity. CSF usually shows a lymphocytic or polymorphonuclear pleocytosis with protein levels that may be as high as 500 mg/dl. MRI of the spinal cord often demonstrates focal areas of increased T2 signal. Acute transverse myelitis may represent the first episode of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica. 179 MRI may have diagnostic value in differentiating these entities from postviral transverse myelitis: partial transverse lesions are more likely to indicate multiple sclerosis, whereas longitudinal involvement of multiple segments is associated with neuromyelitis optica. 180",

            "text": "Initial approach to the patient with suspected Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome involves hospitalization and, if the patient is demonstrating respiratory failure, intubation (see Chapter 59) . The major initial step in patients with suspected postinfectious encephalomyelitis is to exclude multifocal CNS infection or, less likely, vasculitis. In patients with transverse myelitis, extrinsic spinal cord compression requiring surgery must be excluded. Lumbar puncture is of diagnostic value in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In contrast, the most valuable diagnostic test in postinfectious encephalomyelitis or transverse myelitis is contrast-enhanced MRI. In Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, the efficacy of plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin G has been demonstrated in controlled trials, as discussed in Chapter 59. In contrast, the treatment of ADEM is typically based on case reports and observational studies; some evidence exists for the use of methylprednisolone, usually given at a dose of 1 gram daily for 5 days. 154, [172] [173] [174] 181 Plasma exchange (usually five exchanges in total, performed daily or every other day) and intravenous immunoglobulin G, given as a total dose of 2 g/kg over 3 to 5 days, have also been used, either in combination with methylprednisolone or after methylprednisolone failure. 174 A variety of other immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide have been used in individual cases. Initial treatment of acute transverse myelitis typically involves high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. 181 Although treatment of acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis is frequently unsuccessful, occasional patients have survived after early treatment with combinations of methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin G, plasma exchange, or cyclophosphamide. 172 ",
