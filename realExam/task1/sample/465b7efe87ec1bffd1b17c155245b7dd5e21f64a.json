A total of 419 students from two faculties were invited to participate in this 8-week intervention, 155 participants in the control group and 264 in the experimental group. In the experimental group, the researchers incorporated guided activities Module Intervention Model (MIM) using mobile devices into the ESL lessons whereas the control group lessons were without guided activities. Participants from both groups were asked to record their daily mobile device use for activities related to English language learning using an online form. These data were compared to the results of the tests conducted pre-and post-treatment. At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students. However, treatment group students who spent more time using mobile devices to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spent minimal time. This finding re-established the importance of guided activities as intervention to facilitate students' learning and points to the need for curricular modernization and faculty development in the instructional use of technology. Due to the increased need for online instruction precipitated by \"social distancing and isolation' required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, the need for faculty to acquire skills in guided use of mobile devices for school-related learning is anticipated to be greater than ever.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Technology has undergone significant progress that benefits many, including educational stakeholders.

This is seen in the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 for higher education where Globalised Online Learning has been outlined as the 9th shift that will spur continued excellence in the higher education system (Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015). However, based on the current observation of language classes in higher institution, the usage of mobile learning is rarely continuous. Rather, it is utilised once in a while to ease information transfer and to attract language learners' attention to the lessons. There is no proper long-term target of enhancing learners' proficiency.

Meanwhile, Barrs (2011) recommended that detailed guidance and explanation on how to use smartphones appropriately in classroom settings is imperative if meaningful learning is to take place. Along the same vein, Chen's (2013) action research investigated how students used tablet computers for informal language learning and observed their attitudes towards the new mobile technology. It was found that simply providing students with the mobile device did not result in its effective use in language learning. Learners need to be properly guided not only technologically, but also methodologically, as some students lack the necessary knowledge and experience to solve problems in the process of adopting new technologies. Similarly, Ng et al. (2017) found that facilitating the use of smartphone is essential and the findings recommended that future studies should focus on ways to facilitate learners' intentional behaviour towards the use of smartphones so that they will develop the capacity to use them to assist their learning processes.

This change has not only affected students' learning but also the teaching approaches adopted by teachers. As technology is advancing and becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it has become inseparable from our daily lives. Nowadays, such technological advancements as smartphones and computers have become necessities upon which people are relying to stay socially connected and to access information. Irrefutably, education institutions are among the places where the advancement of technology has taken effect, especially in the classrooms. Students and teachers now have the access to multiple free applications as well as other online learning tools that are useful in enhancing learning. Students and teachers have seen the advances, noticing how technology has expanded the opportunity to study (Navarro 2012) . As technological devices are becoming more important, the Internet has assumed a critical role teaching and learning. In schools, for instance, the number of computers inside the classroom continues to increase making the computer the most important tool in school, making the Internet influence a big part of students' lives (Navarro 2012) . The use of technology in education however, has to be well managed and tuned in order to unleash its true potential for positive impact on teaching and learning. Educational technology is not, and never will be, transformative on its own as it requires the assistance of educators who integrate technology into the curriculum, align it with student learning goals, and use it for engaged learning projects (Navarro 2012) .

This indicates that on an average day, the students spent about 1.9 h engaging in the 6 types of use in their learning. Using smartphone to view PowerPoint presentation and reviewing class notes seem to be the highest use of time among the 6 types of use. This could be due to the reason that in tertiary level of teaching and learning, lecturers use PowerPoint to present their teaching contents. These materials are usually uploaded to the university learning website to be accessed by students either before or after the classes. Thus, it is not a surprise that these 2 types of use top the rest as they are both interrelated. Students would spend time on their smartphone viewing the PowerPoint to review the notes or content delivered by their instructors. In line with this, Raver and Maydosz (2010) found that students who were provided with their instructors' lecture notes or PowerPoint slides before or after the lecture performed better in a pre-test/post-test comparison than students who were not provided with these aids. In order to determine whether the time spent in using mobile devices to learn language significantly increases learners' language performance, the second hypothesis of the study was tested. Treatment group students who spend more time in using mobile devices to learn language was hypothesized to display better performance compared to those who spend lesser time. Pearson correlation was use to correlate the relationship between time spent on the activities using mobile devices and the students' performance. The following table shows the correlations. Table 6 displays the correlations of the variables used in this study among the experimental group. The results reveal there is a positive significant correlation at p = .000 between post-test mark and mark change. However, there is no significant correlation between post-test mark, mark change and time spent in the activities using smartphone.

Treatment group students who spent more time for in using smartphone to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spend minimal time.

In this study, the possibility of such outcome could be explained by the starting point or the pre-test marks which were already high in comparison with the post-test marks.
