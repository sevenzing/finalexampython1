In Europe, even the legal concept of data ownership is unclear. We reflect on requirements analyses, reference architectures and solution concepts pursued by the International Data Spaces Initiative to address these issues. The second part will more deeply explore our current interdisciplinary research in a visionary \"Internet of Production\" with 27 research groups from production and materials engineering, computer science, business and social sciences. In this setting, massive amounts of heterogeneous data must be exchanged and analyzed across organizational and disciplinary boundaries, throughout the lifecycle from (re-)engineering, to production, usage and recycling, under hard resource and time constraints.
