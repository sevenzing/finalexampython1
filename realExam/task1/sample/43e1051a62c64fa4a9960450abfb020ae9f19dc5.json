Her highest recorded temperature was 38.0\u00b0C; in addition she had a wet cough characterized by a small amount of sputum that was white in color and easy to expectorate. There was no cold sensitivity, chills, muscle aches, chest tightness, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, chest pain, or other discomfort. Her medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, her temperature was 38.0\u00b0C, her blood pressure was 146/67 mmHg, and coarse breath sounds were auscultated in both lungs; no other abnormalities were found. Chest CT revealed multiple ground glass opacities (GGOs) in both lungs, predominantly distributed subpleurally and in the middle and lateral lung fields, especially in the right lung, where they had partially fused into patches. Local interlobular septal thickening was also observed. Consequently, the possibility of viral pneumonia was considered ( Fig. 1A-C) . Laboratory tests demonstrated a reduced total white blood cell count (2.43 \u00d7 10 9 /L; normal reference values: 4-10 \u00d7 10 9 /L) and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (18 mg/L; normal reference values: 0-3.00 mg/L).

Aerosol transmission is possible when exposed to a high aerosol concentration for a long period in a relatively closed environment. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days, most commonly 3 to 7 days, and the elderly are more susceptible to this infection. The major clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue, and dry cough and can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. 6 The principal confirmatory laboratory test is the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, which is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Additionally, reduced total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts and elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase levels are observed in some patients along with elevated CRP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate noted in the majority of patients. Our patient was from an epidemic area, and the clinical manifestations were presented with a history of intermittent fever which was accompanied by a wet cough. Laboratory tests demonstrated a reduced total white blood cell count and elevated CRP level which was consistent with the findings in other reports.",

            "text": "Imaging investigations are vital for the management of COVID-19. Owing to the fast imaging speed and high-intensity resolution, chest CT, especially high-resolution CT, has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected COVID-19 cases or patients who have negative results on nucleic acid tests. Based on the lung imaging findings, COVID-19 can be divided into four stages. While there is overlap between the imaging manifestations of each stage, the findings in the critical stage are relatively specific. [7] [8] [9] In the early stage, diffuse subpleural GGOs or small nodular opacities can be found in both lungs, with interlobular septal thickening and fine grid-like shadows observed locally, with the lesions mostly located subpleurally in the lung periphery. In the progressive stage, the lesions undergo rapid progression and changes involving multiple lung lobes and spread from the periphery to the center of both lungs. Some GGOs will fuse into patches with a significant increase in intrapulmonary consolidation. In addition, the \"crazy-paving\" sign and air bronchograms can be observed, along with significant interlobular septal thickening that may be accompanied by fibrous cord-like shadows, often without pleural effusion. In the critical phase, lesions may increase by more than 50% within 48 hours, and both lungs may show extensive or diffuse consolidation, even presenting with \"white-out lung\" in severe cases. Air bronchograms can still be observed locally and may be accompanied by a small amount of unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion; lymphadenopathy, meanwhile, is seldom observed. In the recovery stage, bilateral lesions are gradually absorbed and start shrinking, meanwhile, dispersed fibrous cord-like shadows can be observed, showing interstitial fibrotic changes. The imaging manifestations of the present case were consistent with those of previous reports. With respect to the above stages, the case reported here tended toward an imaging diagnosis of the progressive stage.",

Viral pneumonia generally manifests as pulmonary interstitial changes with alveolar wall edema. The CT findings mainly include GGOs, partial fusion and consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, grid-like shadows, and fibrous cord-like shadows. Given the similarities in the imaging findings of different viral pneumonias, however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 should be considered only after taking into account the clinical data, epidemiology, and laboratory test results, and the final diagnosis should be confirmed by pathogenic tests. Furthermore, COVID-19 must be differentiated from non-viral pneumonia such as bacterial pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumonia (both common in children and adolescents), non-infectious diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic pneumonia, and mixed infections.",
