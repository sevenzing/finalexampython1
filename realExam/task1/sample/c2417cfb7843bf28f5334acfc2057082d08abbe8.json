However, theoretically, SLA by itself has small net positive effect on RGR because any increase in SLA inevitably causes a decrease in area-based leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC a ), another RGR component. It was hypothesized that, for a correlation between SLA and RGR, SLA needs to be associated with specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR), which counteracts the negative effect of SLA on LNC a . \u2022 Five trees and six herbs were grown under optimal conditions and relationships between SAR and RGR components were analyzed using a model based on balanced growth hypothesis. \u2022 SLA varied 1.9-fold between species. Simulations predicted that, if SAR is not associated with SLA, this variation in SLA would cause a 47% decrease in LNC a along the SLA gradient, leading to a marginal net positive effect on RGR. In reality, SAR was positively related to SLA, showing a 3.9-fold variation, which largely compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNC a . Consequently, LNC a values were almost constant across species and a positive SLA-RGR relationship was achieved. \u2022 These results highlight the importance of leaf-root interactions in understanding interspecific differences in RGR.",

If so, the decreases in LNC a caused by SLA are compensated for, and an 'apparent' correlation between RGR and SLA may be established. From Eqn 4, the negative effect of SLA can be compensated if LNP or 'a' negatively, or SAR positively, correlates with SLA. However, LNP may generally positively correlate with SLA (Wright & Westoby, 2000) , and nitrogen allocation between organs may not be systematically different between species (Osone & Tateno, 2005b) . Thus, the most likely candidate appears to be SAR. In fact, Osone & Tateno (2005b) demonstrated, by means of a comparative experiment and a physiologically controlled experiment, that SAR positively affects leaf : root ratio, leaf nitrogen, and maximum photosynthesis rate. Furthermore, limited studies showed that SLA correlates positively with SAR across species, and the close associations between SAR and RGR reported in these studies also suggest a strong involvement of SAR in determining RGR Garnier, 1991; Poorter et al., 1991; Reich et al., 1998b; Wright & Westoby, 2000) . However, how SAR interacts with each of these leaf parameters and how much SAR contributes to RGR remain poorly understood.",

Seeds of all tree species except Salix spp. and Z. serrata were germinated on moist vermiculite or moist filter paper, and the seedlings with two leaves were transplanted individually into 1.6 l polyethylene pots filled with washed river sand. The collected Z. serrata seedlings were first transplanted onto moist vermiculite for 1 wk to allow the roots to recover from any damage or injury sustained at the time of collection and then transplanted individually into pots. Seeds of the herb species and Salix spp. were germinated directly in polyethylene pots filled with washed river sand then the seedlings were thinned to only one per pot. Nutrient solution was given to allow the species to absorb nitrogen at their potential rates through the entire experimental period. Since the maximum nitrogen absorption rate reported in an earlier study was 0.1 g N g \u22121 d \u22121 for a herb species (Poorter et al., 1991) , the nitrogen content of the pots was maintained well above a concentration that allowed absorption at this maximum. In the early stages of the experiments, each plant was given 500 ml of nutrient solution once a day, then later, when the plants were larger, twice a day to avoid nutrient depletion. Every 2 d, the pots were flushed with tap water to avoid salt accumulation. The air temperature in the chamber was maintained between 22 and 26\u00b0C over each 24 h period to follow the daily time course of the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).

Before Path analysis, all data were lntransformed. Based on the balanced growth hypothesis, our path model assumed that SLA, LNP, leaf : root ratio and SAR affect LNC a , and that the leaf : root ratio adjusts the balance between carbon inflow (SLA and LNP) and nitrogen inflow (SAR). The relationships between LNP, SLA, and SAR were set as covariations, that is, with no direct effects between these variables. However, it is conceivable that SLA, in part, directly affects LNP, since it is mostly determined by lamina thickness and the density of the leaf tissues, which affect the net photosynthetic rate per unit leaf nitrogen by influencing the degree of attenuation of photons passing through and the rate of CO 2 diffusion in the leaves (Hikosaka, et al., 1998; Poorter & Evans, 1998) . However, anatomical factors are not the only factors affecting photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency. Hikosaka et al. (1998) showed that differ-ences in allocation of nitrogen to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, a key enzyme of photosynthesis, and specific activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase also affect photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency. Thus, we assumed that SLA and LNP would covary with each other so as to follow the 'plant trait syndrome', that is, multiple plant traits having evolved in a coordinated manner showing a specific combination between species (Reich et al., 1992; Grime, 2001) .",

This inconsistency suggests that there are one or more factors compensating for the negative effect of SLA on LNC a preventing LNC a of larger SLA species from decreasing. Figure 3 shows the relationships between SLA and the other parameters in Eqn 4. The leaf : root ratio decreased slightly with SLA (Fig. 3a) . Although the trend was not statistically significant, this may to some extent compensate for the negative effect of SLA. To estimate how much of an effect this might have, we calculated species LNC a values using Eqn 4, assigning measured species values to SLA and the leaf : root ratio, while fixing other parameters with the values obtained from Z. serrata between species (simulation 2). LNC a values calculated in this simulation (Fig. 2a , open circles) were generally larger than those in simulation 1, but still smaller than the measured LNC a values. This suggests that the leaf : root ratio partly compensated for the negative effect of SLA on LNC a , but there should be factors also affecting LNC a positively. LNP increased with SLA (Fig. 3b) . Since an increase in LNP negatively affects LNC a (Eqn 4), this should not compensate for the negative effect of SLA. In a similar manner to simulation 2, the coupled effects of SLA and LNP on LNC a values were calculated assigning measured species values to SLA and LNP in Eqn 4 while fixing other parameters (simulation 3). The calculated LNC a values showed only a slight decrease compared with simulation 1 (Fig. 2b) , suggesting that the negative effect of LNP was small, even though LNP showed the same degree of variation as SLA (Fig. 1a,c) . The coefficient of the relationship between mass-based leaf nitrogen concentration and plant nitrogen concentration, a, was almost constant across species (Fig. 3c) , and therefore had little effect on LNC a (Fig. 2c, simulation 4) . Finally, SAR showed a large increase with SLA (Fig. 3d) . LNC a values calculated using Eqn 4 by assigning observed values to SLA and SAR with all other parameters kept constant across species were much larger than those in simulation 1 and close to the measured LNC a values (Fig. 2d, simulation 5 ). This suggests that the negative effect of SLA on LNC a was largely compensated for by SAR.",

Because of the smaller LNC a of species with a larger SLA, the calculated RGR increased only marginally with increases in SLA (Fig. 4a) . Although LNP by itself had a less negative effect on LNC a (Fig. 2b) , the slope of RGR on LNP was also reduced because of the correlation with SLA (Fig. 4b) .

Across all species, LNC a showed no significant relationship with SAR but instead showed convergence. However, within the five species with similar SLA (SLA between 30 and 36 m 2 kg \u22121 , closed circles), LNC a showed a strong positive relationship with SAR (r 2 = 0.89, P = 0.001). As the variation in SLA was small among these species, this increase in LNC a represents the positive effects of SAR on LNC a , excluding the effects of SLA. On the other hand, a between-group comparison showed the effects of SLA on LNC a excluding the effects of SAR. At the same SAR, species with smaller SLA (open squares) generally showed a larger LNC a than the five species described (located above the regression line of the five species), while those with larger SLA (open circles) showed a smaller LNC a (located below the regression line of the five species), indicating that SLA negatively affected LNC a . The apparent convergence of LNC a when all species were included was thus a result of these opposing effects of SLA and SAR counteracting each other. Similar patterns were observed for the leaf : root ratio when grouping species by SLA (Fig. 5b) ; at a similar SAR, the leaf : root ratio was smaller in larger SLA species, while at a similar SLA, it was larger in larger-SAR species. This suggests that the leaf : root ratio was also affected by SLA and SAR in a coordinated manner. Figure 6 shows the data collected from studies by Poorter and co-workers Poorter et al., , 1991 and by Reich et al. (1998a,b) together with the present data. Note that the parameters were plotted against SAR so as to contrast parameters that affect LNC a negatively on the y-axis with SAR, which affects LNC a positively, on the x-axis. As in the present study, SLA and LNP were strongly correlated with SAR in these earlier studies (Fig. 6a,b) , although LNP showed distinct between-study differences. The leaf : root ratio increased with SAR slightly in Poorter's dataset, but showed no consistent relationship in Reich's dataset (Fig. 6c) . In Poorter's study, LNC a decreased with SAR only slightly, Fig. 4 Simulated relationships between relative growth rate and specific leaf area (a), and relative growth rate and leaf nitrogen productivity (b). Closed circles, measured values; open circles, simulated values. For simulated relative growth rate (RGR) values, area-based leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC a ) was first calculated using Eqn 4, assuming that parameters other than specific nitrogen absorption rate of roots (SAR) were constant across species (assuming that there was no positive effect of SAR); RGRs were then calculated with Eqn 2, assigning these LNC a values.

On the other hand, in Reich's study, LNC a decreased with SAR more greatly. At first glance, this was different from the present result, but in fact did not contradict the balanced growth hypothesis. In Reich's dataset, slopes of SLA and LNP on SAR were larger than those in the present study and Poorter's study, indicating that the negative effects of SLA and LNP on LNC a were more dominant over the positive effects of SAR on LNC a than in these other studies. Therefore, if the balanced growth hypothesis is true, LNC a should decrease more steeply than the other datasets. Equation 4 showed that in Reich's dataset, where 3.6-and 3.4-fold variations in SLA and LNP were associated with a 7.6-fold variation in SAR, compensation of the negative effects of SLA and LNP by SAR should be 40% (LNC a should decrease by 60% with increasing SAR). This is almost in accordance with the observed 64% decrease in LNC a in the dataset, suggesting that the behavior of LNC a followed the balanced growth hypothesis. As a result of the combined behaviors of LNC a and LNP on SAR, NAR increased with SAR in the present and Reich's study and showed no consistent pattern with SAR in Poorter's study (Fig. 6e) .",

The path model that was derived was not significantly rejected (\u03c7 2 = 2.5, 1 df, P = 0.11). Further, each of the path coefficients predicted by the model was significantly different from zero (P < 0.05) and all signs of the path coefficients were in the predicted direction except for that from LNP to the leaf : root ratio. The lack of a significant relationship between LNP and the leaf : root ratio was caused by the relatively large betweenstudy differences in the two variables, which might reflect the differences in experimental conditions between studies.

Given that a larger SLA increases carbon inflow and a larger SAR increases nitrogen inflow to plants, these responses are analogous to the phenotypic response of the leaf : root ratio to changes in the external environment. In general, plants increase their leaf : root ratio in response to factors that increase nitrogen inflow relative to carbon inflow such as increased soil nitrogen availability, and decrease the ratio in response to factors that decrease nitrogen inflow relative to carbon inflow, such as increased light intensity (Kachi & Rorison, 1989; Olff, 1992; Poorter, 1999; Osone & Tateno, 2005a) . These phenotypic responses are adaptive, allowing plants to compensate for relatively growth-limiting resources and maintain high growth rates under a wide range of environmental conditions (\u00c5gren & Ingestad, 1987; Hirose, 1987; Kachi & Rorison, 1989; Ishizaki et al., 2003; Osone & Tateno, 2005a) . Similar to this phenotypic response, a plant species with a specific combination of SLA and SAR may adjust its biomass allocation to increase either the carbon or nitrogen inflow, depending on which is more growth-limiting for the species. However, these trends were masked when all species were included in the comparisons, because the covariation of SLA and SAR caused counteraction of these Fig. 6 Interaction between leaf and root properties in the present study and in the two previous studies.

Since NAR is generally a curvilinear function of LNC a , with the x-intercept larger than zero (Hirose, 1986; Van der Werf et al., 1993; Osone & Tateno, 2005a,b) , LNP is maximized at LNC a when the tangent from the origin touches the NAR-LNC a curve, and is decreased with LNC a moving away from the point. If this relationship were included, the decreases in LNC a of larger SLA species would be less than what was actually calculated, because the concomitant decreases in LNP should alleviate further decreases in LNC a (see Eqn 4).",

In the present study, SRL varied approx. fivefold between species and positively related with SAR (r 2 = 0.41, unpublished data), but the area-based nitrogen absorption rate differed only 1.5-fold between species.

Consistent with the present study, the negative effects of SLA and LNP on LNC a were largely compensated for by SAR in Poorter's dataset (Fig. 6d) . However, in Reich's study, the negative effects were only compensated for by 36% (a 64% decrease in LNC a , Fig. 6d ). This lower degree of compensation might be caused by differences in the experimental conditions. In Reich's study, plants were given nutrient solution with a nitrogen concentration almost half that of the present study once a day, compared with twice a day in the present study. Therefore, species with higher carbon gain (i.e. higher SLA and LNP) might experience nitrogen depletion as they grow and absorb nitrogen at a lower rate than their potential, while other species might absorb nitrogen near their potential. This should result in a relatively small SAR to SLA (a steep SLA-SAR slope), and thus a decreased LNC a in larger SLA species. From these results, we tentatively conclude that the covariation of SAR with SLA and LNP is a general trend, but that the degree of compensation by SAR may differ between datasets or experimental conditions. To generalize what experimental conditions causes partial or full compensation requires further studies.",

This might be because of the difference in light conditions. In the present study, where plants were grown in a naturally illuminated growth chamber, they gradually closed their stomata from early afternoon when the light intensity was maximized (1700 \u00b5mol m \u22122 s \u22121 ) and accordingly the photosynthetic rate decreased. On the other hand, in Poorter's study, where plants were grown under a constant weaker photon flux density of 315 \u00b5mol m \u22122 s \u22121 under 14-h-day period, plants were possibly able to photosynthesize at a constant rate during the daytime. This might have caused a larger daily assimilation (NAR), and thus LNP, in Poorter's study than in the present study (Fig. 6b,e) , although the average light intensity during the daytime was lower in the former. When carbon inflow is limiting, plants generally increase leaf : root ratio to compensate for the small carbon inflow (Hirose, 1987; Hilbert et al., Fig. 7 A hypothetical path model for leaf and root properties. Singleheaded arrows represent direct relationship or causality. Doubleheaded arrows represent indirect relationship or covariation.

Numbers beside each arrow represent standardized path coefficients. 1991). Thus, the larger leaf : root ratio in the present study might be a response to the smaller daily assimilation (Fig. 6c) . It is notable, however, that the LNC a -SAR relationships were still conservative between the two studies (Fig. 6d) , despite the large difference in LNP. These results suggest that the leaf and root physiological properties and biomass allocation are strictly coordinated between species.",

            "text": "Despite broad agreement on the relationship between RGR and SLA, no consensus has been reached with regard to the relationships between RGR and NAR, and RGR and LMR, in studies of comparative growth analysis (reviewed by Poorter & Van der Werf, 1998) . A possible explanation for the inconsistency is the differences in ambient light adopted in different studies (Poorter, 1999; Ryser & Wahl, 2001; Shipley, 2002 Shipley, , 2006 ; see also Medek et al., 2007) . In an experiment where plants experience a weak ambient light at which photosynthesis is not light-saturated, the species difference in NAR is small, and thus SLA remains the main determinant of RGR. Conversely, in an experiment where higher ambient light is adopted, species differences in NAR are highlighted, and thus NAR will become the main determinant of RGR. Shipley (2006) provided strong support for this contention by meta-analysis, but also pointed out that substantial inconsistencies between studies still remain that cannot be accounted for by differences in light conditions. The present study may provide a supplementary explanation for this issue. From our hypotheses, the pattern of species LNC a in a dataset depends on the net effects of parameters that affect LNC a both positively (SAR) and negatively (SLA, LNP). Therefore, theoretically, LNC a could either decrease or increase independently with LNP between species. Since NAR is a product of LNC a and LNP, these inconsistent behaviors of LNC a and LNP may interfere with a consistent pattern of NAR between studies. In a dataset where LNC a and LNP are negatively related, a positive relationship between LNP and RGR is always offset to a certain extent by the negative relationship between LNC a and RGR. In this case, the extent of the relationship between RGR and NAR will be determined by the relative strength of the relationships between LNP and RGR, and between LNC a and RGR in the dataset. The datasets of Poorter and Reich in Fig. 6 provide good examples of this. In the two datasets, the relationships between SAR and other parameters presented in Fig. 6 can be equated by the relationships between RGR and the parameters, since SAR was strongly related to RGR (P < 0.001). In Reich's study, LNP increased and LNC a decreased with SAR (and thus RGR), and LNP showed a much steeper increase with SAR than the decrease in LNC a with SAR (Figs 6b,d) . Consequently, NAR, the product of LNP and LNC a , showed a positive relationship with SAR (and thus RGR) (Fig. 6e) . In Poorter's dataset, LNP and LNC a also showed inverse trends with SAR, but the increase in LNP balanced the decrease in LNC a (Fig. 6b,d) . As a result, NAR was almost constant with SAR (and thus RGR) (Fig. 6e) . In a dataset in which LNC a does not show a distinct converse trend with LNP, without such countervailing effects between LNC a and LNP, a positive relationship between NAR and RGR might exist. An example of this is provided by the present study. In the present study, LNC a was almost constant to RGR (Fig. 1d) , while LNP increased with RGR (Fig. 1c) , which results in NAR being positively related to RGR (Fig. 1b) . Similarly, Wright & Westoby (2000) suggested that the negative correlation between LNP and LNC a and the different degrees of correlation between studies could cause the lack of a general pattern in the RGR-NAR relationship between studies.",
