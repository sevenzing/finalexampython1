was unprecedented in the number of cases and fatalities, geographic distribution, and number of nations affected, highlights the need for safe, effective, and readily available antiviral agents for treatment and prevention of acute Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) or sequelae 1 . No antiviral therapeutics have yet received regulatory approval or demonstrated clinical efficacy. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule GS-5734, a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue, with antiviral activity against EBOV. GS-5734 exhibits antiviral activity against multiple variants of EBOV and other filoviruses in cellbased assays. The pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) is efficiently formed in multiple human cell types incubated with GS-5734 in vitro, and the NTP acts as an alternative substrate and RNA-chain terminator in primer-extension assays using a surrogate respiratory syncytial virus RNA polymerase. Intravenous administration of GS-5734 to nonhuman primates resulted in persistent NTP levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (halflife, 14 h) and distribution to sanctuary sites for viral replication including testes, eyes, and brain. In a rhesus monkey model of EVD, once-daily intravenous administration of 10 mg kg \u22121 GS-5734 for 12 days resulted in profound suppression of EBOV replication and protected 100% of EBOV-infected animals against lethal disease, ameliorating clinical disease signs and pathophysiological markers, even when treatments were initiated three days after virus exposure when systemic viral RNA was detected in two out of six treated animals. These results show the first substantive post-exposure protection by a small-molecule antiviral compound against EBOV in nonhuman primates. The broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GS-5734 in vitro against other pathogenic RNA viruses, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and coronaviruses, suggests the potential for wider medical use.

Structurally, the 1\u2032-cyano group provides potency and selectivity towards viral RNA polymerases, but because of slow first phosphorylation kinetics, modification of parent nucleosides with monophosphate promoieties has the potential to greatly enhance intracellular NTP concentrations 20 . GS-5734, the single Sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl l-alaninate phosphoramidate prodrug (Supplementary Information), effectively bypasses the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step of the Nuc (Fig. 1a) . In human monocyte-derived macrophages, incubation with GS-5734 caused rapid loading of cells with high levels of NTP that persist with a half-life (t 1/2 ) of 24 h following removal of GS-5734 (Extended Data Fig. 1a) , resulting in up to 30-fold higher levels compared to incubation with Nuc (Fig. 1b) . In cell-based assays, GS-5734 is active against a broad range of filoviruses including Marburg virus and several variants of EBOV (Fig. 1c) . GS-5734 inhibits EBOV replication in multiple relevant human cell types including primary macrophages and human endothelial cells with half-maximum effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 0.06 to 0.14 \u03bcM ( Table 1) .

In contrast, NTP did not inhibit human RNA polymerases (Fig. 1e) . These data suggest that GS-5734 selectively inhibits EBOV replication by targeting its RdRp and inhibiting viral RNA synthesis following efficient intracellular conversion to NTP. Rodent models were not suitable for GS-5734 in vivo efficacy evaluations because high serum esterase activity, present in many rodent species, degrades the GS-5734 promoiety and adversely impacts its pharmacokinetic profile 23 . Like humans, rhesus monkeys do not express high levels of serum esterase; rhesus lymphoid cells efficiently activated GS-5734 in vitro, although NTP levels were reduced relative to human cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b) .

The assay plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 1 \u00d7 PBS. The secondary detection antibody was an anti-mouse (or rabbit) IgG conjugated with Dylight488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue number 405310). The secondary antibody was diluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer and was added to each well in the assay plate. Assay plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using Draq5 (Biostatus) or 33342 Hoechst (ThermoFisher Scientific) for Vero and HFF-1 cell lines. Both dyes were diluted in 1\u00d7 PBS. The cytoplasm of HFF-1 (EBOV assay) and Vero E6 (MERS assay) cells were counter-stained with CellMask Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell images were acquired using a Perkin Elmer Opera confocal plate reader (Perkin Elmer) using a \u00d710 air objective to collect five images per well. Virus-specific antigen was quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 488 nm wavelength and the stained nuclei were quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 640 nm wavelength. Acquired images were analysed using Harmony and Acapella PE software. The Draq5 signal was used to generate a nuclei mask to define each nuclei in the image for quantification of cell number. The CellMask Deep Red dye was used to demarcate the Vero and HFF-1 cell borders for cell-number quantitation. The viral-antigen signal was compartmentalized within the cell mask. Cells that exhibited antigen signal higher than the selected threshold were counted as positive for viral infection. The ratio of virus-positive cells to total number of analysed cells was used to determine the percentage of infection for each well on the assay plates. The effect of compounds on the viral infection was assessed as percentage of inhibition of infection in comparison to control wells. The resultant cell number and percentage of infection were normalized for each assay plate. Analysis of dose-response curve was performed using GeneData Screener software applying Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for curve-fitting strategy. The curve-fitting process, including individual data point exclusion, was pre-specified by default software settings.

After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 3-12 h, 10 \u03bcl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 10 \u03bcl of the loading dye (98% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol and 0.1% bromophenol blue), heated at 75 \u00b0C for 5 min, and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel (8 M urea). The gel was dried for 45 min at 70 \u00b0C and exposed to a phosphorimager screen. The full length product, 363 nucleotide runoff RNA, was quantified using a Typhoon Trio Imager and Image Quant TL Software. Inhibition of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Twenty nanomolar POLRMT was incubated with 20 nM template plasmid (pUC18-LSP) containing POLRMT light-strand promoter region and mitochondrial (mt) transcription factors TFA (100 nM) and mtTFB2 (20 nM) in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1 mg ml \u22121 BSA, and 10 mM MgCl 2 34 . The reaction mixture was pre-incubated to 32 \u00b0C, and the reactions were initiated by addition of 2.5 \u03bcM of each of the natural NTPs and 1.5 \u03bcCi of [ 32 P]GTP. After incubation for 30 min at 32 \u00b0C, reactions were spotted on DE81 paper and quantified. Molecular modelling. A homology model of RSV A2 and EBOV polymerases were built using the HIV reverse transcriptase X-ray crystal structure (PDB:1RTD). Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2015-1: Prime, version 3.9 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC), default settings with subsequent rigid body minimization and side-chain optimization. Loop insertions not in 1RTD of greater than 10 amino acids were not built. qRT-PCR for in vivo studies. For quantitative assessment of viral RNA nonhuman primate plasma samples, whole blood was collected using a K3 EDTA Greiner Vacuette tube (or equivalent) and sample centrifuged at 2500 (\u00b1 200) relative centrifugal force for 10 \u00b1 2 min. To inactivate virus, plasma was treated with 3 parts (300 \u03bcl) TriReagent LS and samples were transferred to frozen storage (\u221260 \u00b0C to \u221290 \u00b0C), until removal for RNA extraction. Carrier RNA and QuantiFast High Concentration Internal Control (Qiagen) were spiked into the sample before extraction, conducted according to manufacturer's instructions. The viral RNA was eluted in AVE buffer. Each extracted RNA sample was tested with the QuantiFast Internal Control RT-PCR RNA Assay (Qiagen) to evaluate the yield of the spiked-in QuantiFast High Concentration Internal Control. If the internal control amplified within manufacturer-designated ranges, further quantitative analysis of the viral target was performed. RT-PCR was conducted using an ABI 7500 Fast Dx using primers specific to EBOV glycoprotein. Samples were run in triplicate using a 5 \u03bcl template volume. For quantitative assessments, the average of the triplicate genomic equivalents (GE) per reaction were determined and multiplied by 800 to obtain GE ml \u22121 plasma. Standard curves were generated using synthetic RNA. The limits of quantification for this assay are 8.0 \u00d7 10 4 \u2212 8.0 \u00d7 10 10 GE ml \u22121 of plasma. Acceptance criteria for positive template control (PTC), negative template control (NTC), negative extraction control (NEC), and positive extraction control (PEC) are specified by standard operating procedure. For qualitative assessments, the limit of detection (LOD) was defined as C t 38.07, based on method validation testing. An animal was considered to have tested positive for detection of EBOV RNA when a minimum of 2 of 3 replicates were designated as 'positive' and PTC, NTC, and NEC controls met specified method-acceptance criteria. A sample was designated as 'positive' when the C t value was <LOD C t . Pharmacokinetic evaluations. Three uninfected male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were used for the pharmacokinetic study. GS-5734 was formulated in solution at 5 mg ml \u22121 with 12% sulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin in water, pH 3.5-4.0, and 2 ml kg \u22121 was administered by slow bolus (approximately 1 min) for a final dose of 10 mg kg \u22121 . Blood samples for plasma and PBMCs were collected from a femoral vein/artery and were taken from each monkey over a 24-h period. Plasma samples were obtained at predose and at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h postdose. PBMC samples were obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Blood samples for plasma were collected into chilled collection tubes containing sodium fluoride/potassium oxalate as the anticoagulant and were immediately placed on wet ice, followed by centrifugation to obtain plasma. Blood samples for PBMC isolation were collected at room temperature into CPT vacutainer tubes containing sodium heparin for isolation. Plasma and isolated PBMC samples were frozen immediately and stored at \u226460 \u00b0C until analysed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Data reporting."}, {"text": "For plasma analysis, an aliquot of 25 \u03bcl of each plasma sample was treated with 100 \u03bcl of 90% methanol and acetonitrile mixture (1:1, v:v) and 10% water with 20 nM 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole as an internal standard. Then, 100 \u03bcl of samples were filtered through an Agilent Captiva 96 well 0.2 \u03bcm filter plate. Filtered samples were dried down completely for approximately 20 min and reconstituted with 1% acetonitrile and 99% water with 0.01% formic acid. An aliquot of 10 \u03bcl was injected for LC-MS/MS using a HTC Pal autosampler. Analytes were separated on a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP 30A column (75 \u00d7 2.0 mM, 4.0 \u03bcm) using a Waters Acquity ultra performance LC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), a flow rate of 0.26 ml min \u22121 , and a gradient from Mobile phase A containing 0.2% formic acid in 99% water and 1% acetonitrile to mobile phase B containing 0.2% formic acid in 95% acetonitrile and 5% water over 4.5 min. For MS/MS analysis, we used a Waters Xevo TQ-S in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode using an electrospray probe. Plasma concentrations of GS-734, alanine metabolite and Nuc were determined using an 8-point calibration curve spanning a concentration range of over three orders of magnitude. Quality control samples were run at the beginning and end of the run to ensure accuracy and precision within 20%. Intracellular metabolites in PBMCs were quantified by LC-MS/MS as described above for in vitro activation studies. Radiolabelled tissue distribution. Six cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were administered a single dose of [ 14 C]GS-5734 at 10 mg kg \u22121 (25 \u03bcCi kg \u22121 ) by intravenous administration (slow bolus). Tissues were collected from three animals at 4 and 168 h postdose. The tissues were excised, rinsed with saline, blotted dry, weighed, and placed on wet ice. Tissues (testes, epididymis, eyes and brain; following homogenization) and plasma were analysed by liquid scintillation counting. Concentrations were converted to ng equivalents of GS-5734 per gram of sample. In vivo efficacy. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were challenged on day 0 by intramuscular injection with a target dose of 1,000 PFU of EBOV Kikwit (Ebola virus H. sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit), which was derived from a clinical specimen obtained during an outbreak occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) in 1995. Challenge virus was propagated from the clinical specimen using cultured cells (Vero or Vero E6) for a total of four passages. Animals (3-6 years old) were randomly assigned to experimental treatment groups, stratified by sex (with equal number of males and females per group) and balanced by body weight, using SAS statistical software. Study personnel responsible for assessing animal health (including euthanasia assessment) and administering treatments were experimentally blinded to group assignment of animals. The primary endpoint for efficacy studies was survival to day 28 following virus challenge. GS-5734 was formulated at Gilead Sciences in water with 12% sulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (SBE-\u03b2-CD), pH adjusted to 3.0 using HCl. Formulations were administered to anaesthetized animals by bolus intravenous injection at a rate of approximately 1 min per dose in the right or left saphenous vein. The volume of all vehicle or GS-5734 injections was 2.0 ml kg \u22121 body weight.

Serum chemistry was analysed using a Vitros 350 Chemistry System (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics), and coagulation parameters were evaluated using a Sysmex CA-1500 coagulation analyser (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Haematology analysis was conducted using a Siemens Advia 120 Hematology System with multispecies software (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). On days in which GS-5734 or vehicle dosing were scheduled with blood sample collection for clinical pathology or viraemia analysis, blood samples were collected immediately before dose administration. Viral genomic sequence analysis. Analysis of viral genomic sequence was conducted with the purpose of evaluating genomic sequence change patterns consistent with development of resistance against GS-5734. Attempts were made to obtain sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (L) of Ebola virus from all EBOV-RNA-positive rhesus monkey plasma samples obtained during the efficacy studies. Deep sequencing screening of the L gene was completed using previously described methods 36, 37 .
