Sequencing revealed a highly simplified microbiota consisting largely of two 28 single bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of Vibrionaceae and Piscirickettsiaceae. The 29 esophagus was dominated by a single ASV of the genus Vibrio. Imaging revealed bacteria in the 30 family Vibrionaceae distributed in a discrete layer that lines the esophagus. This Vibrio was also 31 the primary ASV found in the microbiota of the stomach, cecum, and intestine, but occurred at 32 lower abundance as determined by qPCR and was found only scattered in the lumen rather than 33 in a discrete layer via imaging analysis. Treatment of animals with the commonly-used antibiotic 34 enrofloxacin led to a nearly 80% reduction of the dominant Vibrio ASV in the esophagus but did 35 not significantly alter the relative abundance of bacteria overall between treated versus control 36 animals. Data from the gills was dominated by a single ASV in the family Piscirickettsiaceae, 37 which imaging visualized as small clusters of cells. We conclude that bacteria belonging to the 38 Gammaproteobacteria are the major symbionts of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis cultured from 39 eggs in captivity, and that the esophagus and gills are major colonization sites. Symbiotic associations between invertebrates and bacteria are common. Among cephalopods, the 61 most intensely studied association is the colonization of the light organ of the bobtail squid 62",

The accessory nidamental gland and egg 66 cases of the squid Doryteuthis (Loligo) pealeii and the Chilean octopus (Octopus mimus) have 67 also been reported to contain Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (3, 4) . These 68 associations indicate that bacteria can play a key role in the physiology of cephalopods. In particular, results showed a consistent and highly simplified microbiota in the 103 esophagus ( Figure 1 ; Table 1 ).

The gastrointestinal tract was 272 dissected into four components: esophagus, stomach, cecum, and intestine. Gill tissue and skin 273 from the mantle was sampled as well (~ 0.5g per sample). All tissues were stored in separate 274 sterile cryogenic tubes and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 275Following a pilot study of three individual cuttlefish, we included 24 cuttlefish(16 test, 8 276 control) in an experiment designed to test the effect of the antibiotic treatment on the 277 composition of the cuttlefish microbiome. The experimental design consisted of administering 278 antibiotic to animals in the treatment group (n = 16) via injection into the food source (grass 279 shrimp, Palaemonetes sp.), which was then fed to the animals. Prior to feeding, shrimp were 280 injected with enrofloxacin (Baytril \uf0d2 ; 22.7 mg/mL, Bayer HealthCare LLC, Shawnee Mission, 281 KS, USA) using a 0.5 cc, U-100 insulin syringe with an attached 28 g x 1/2\" needle (Covidien 282 LLC, Mansfield, MA, USA). The antibiotic dosage was 10 mg/kg rounded up to the nearest 283 hundredth mL.

We maintained 8 animals as 285 controls, none of which received antibiotic treatment. Experimental animals were held in two 286 separate water tables and control animals a third, all of which were connected to the same open-287 filtration system fed by filtered seawater.
