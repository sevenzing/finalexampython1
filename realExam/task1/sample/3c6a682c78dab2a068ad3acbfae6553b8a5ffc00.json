[1] and Fouchier et al. [2] . HCoV-NL63 has been shown to cause respiratory tract disease in young children [3, 4] . Esper et al. have reported a novel HCoV designated the \"New Haven coronavirus\" (HCoV-NH) that has been shown by sequence analysis to be very similar to HCoV-NL63 [5] . Esper et al. also reported that HCoV-NH was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 8 (72.7%) of 11 respiratory tract samples from children with Kawasaki disease (KD) and in 1 (4.5%) of 22 age-matched samples from control subjects [6] . On the basis of these data, they suggested that HCoV-NH infection was associated with KD. To further investigate whether HCoV-NH disease is associated with KD, we performed a retrospective study. From October 2002 to May 2003, 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 19 children who fulfilled the criteria for KD and who were treated at Tenshi Hospital in Sapporo, Japan. All of the samples were collected after informed consent was obtained from the children's parents. All of the samples were obtained within 7 days of the onset of illness. The mean age of the children with KD was 22.6 months (range, 4 months-5 years). We used as controls 208 nasopharyngeal swab samples that were collected from children with diagnoses of respiratory tract disease who were admitted to hospitals in Sapporo, Japan, during the same period. All of these samples were examined after the possibility of infection with human respiratory syncytial virus or influenza A or B was excluded by rapid antigen-detection tests. The mean age of the children with respiratory tract disease was 21.6 months (range, 4 months-5 years). After extraction of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA, we performed RT-PCR to detect the HCoV-NH genome, as described by Esper et al. [6] . The primer set and the PCR conditions in our PCR assay were the same as those used in their PCR assays. Sequencing of the PCR products was also performed to confirm the presence of HCoV-NH.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 95, "end": 98, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 119, "end": 122, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 203, "end": 206, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 207, "end": 209, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 643, "end": 646, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1901, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Lack of Association between New Haven Coronavirus and Kawasaki Disease"}, {"text": "Although RNA sequences of HCoV-NH were detected in samples from 5 (2.4%) of the 208 control children with respiratory tract disease, we could not detect any RNA sequences of HCoV-NH in 19 samples from children with KD (table 1) .

Twenty-five-microliter reactions containing 5 mL of the extracted nucleic acid were prepared with the 1-step Access RT-PCR System (Promega). The first primer set used for amplification was an HCoV-NH/ HCoV-NL63-specific primer described by Esper et al.

The amplification program consisted of a reverse-transcription (RT) step of 45 min at 45\u040aC and 2 min at 94\u040aC, to denature the reverse transcriptase; 40 cycles of 1 min at 94\u040aC, 1 min at 55\u040aC, and 1 min at 72\u040aC; and 10 min at 72\u040aC, for final amplicon extension.
