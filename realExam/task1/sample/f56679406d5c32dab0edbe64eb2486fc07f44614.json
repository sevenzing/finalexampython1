The main concern of physicians caring for patients with inflammatory disease treated with immune-targeted therapies is the risk of potentially increased severity in these patients, including the risk of severe pneumonia. However, initial results have highlighted the impact of cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities [10] rather than that of possible immunosuppression, leading some to even consider a protective role for immunosuppressive drugs in severe pneumonia [11] [12] [13] . The limited information currently available comes from a Chinese cohort of 20,000 patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, and from 3 hospitals in Wuhan: no cases of infected patients have been reported [14] . The mystery remains. Are they really uninfected with COVID-19? Have they developed pauci-symptomatic forms? Were our Chinese colleagues too busy with more severe patients to notice a signal in chronic inflammatory diseases?",

            "text": "Recommendations for the management of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection are conditioned by the severity of the patients. While the symptomatic management of respiratory failure is the priority, as early as March 5 the High Council of Public Health proposed the use of specific antiviral treatments (lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir), although none of these molecules has benefited from clinical studies in COVID-19. Since then, the first study of the lopinavir/ritonavir combination has not been able to demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy [15] . However, the health emergency justifies the deployment of all potentially active strategies that are effective in vitro on SARS-CoV-2, sometimes tested during MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1, or proposed in the context of COVID-19 infection in China despite a low level of evidence. The evidence of very high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of intensive care in patients compared to other patients justified a strategy of using biotherapies (tocilizumab, adalimumab). An open-label clinical trial has been published, suggesting, on a cohort of 15 patients, the efficacy of tocilizumab on the cytokine storm potentially responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome [13] . Other drugs, well known among specialists in inflammatory diseases such as hydroxychloroquine [12] and baricitinib [11] , could limit the entry of the virus into the cell and ultimately reduce the viral load. These hypotheses deserve clinical trials, and as such, multicenter studies on hydroxychloroquine have been launched. On the other hand, these same treatments prescribed over the long term, due to the potential immuno-depression induced in our patients suffering from chronic inflammatory disease, could lead to fears of an increased risk of developing a serious form of infection. This risk has notably been evoked in the context of hepatitis B, with fulminant hepatitis B.",

One might, however, regret waiting until him to be get with his back to the wall for decisions to be taken. The use of telemedicine should enable us to avoid exposure of our patients. This is a response to the urgency of the situation. But it must also allow us to ensure continuity of care specific to the management of inflammatory pathology. Suddenly plunged into the deep end, we are going to have to familiarize ourselves with this new tool and make it our own. We can thus think that at the end of this pandemic, we will be able to ensure the follow-up of some of our well-known patients. We may also have developed new skills to identify urgent situations at a distance, such as an infectious complication or a severe outbreak of the disease.

Activity-based pricing (T2A), was introduced in 2004 to harmonize the methods of financing public and private structures and to force public structures to increase their activity, \"forgetting\" that public and private patients often have very different profiles. Hospital fees are set by GHMs (homogeneous groups of patients), weighted by the length of hospital stay.

We are overwhelmed by agencies, including the National Performance Support Agency, which sets bed occupancy rate targets: 92% for a conventional hospitalization service, barely less for an intensive care unit.
