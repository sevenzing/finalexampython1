Much of what we know about viral immunity comes from studies using mouse models. Experiments using the Friend virus (FV) model have been particularly informative in defining highly complex anti-retroviral mechanisms of the intrinsic, innate and adaptive arms of immunity. FV studies have unraveled fundamental principles about how the immune system controls both acute and chronic viral infections. They led to a more complete understanding of retroviral immunity that begins with cellular sensing, production of type I interferons, and the induction of intrinsic restriction factors. Novel mechanisms have been revealed, which demonstrate that these earliest responses affect not only virus replication, but also subsequent innate and adaptive immunity. This review on FV immunity not only surveys the complex host responses to a retroviral infection from acute infection to chronicity, but also highlights the many feedback mechanisms that regulate and counter-regulate the various arms of the immune system. In addition, the discovery of molecular mechanisms of immunity in this model have led to therapeutic interventions with implications for HIV cure and vaccine development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": ", at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Atlantic City, Charlotte Friend reported on the isolation of a virus that produced a fatal leukemia when inoculated into adult mice. This was a time when the concept of viruses causing cancer was still viewed with extreme skepticism and the presentation of such data by a young woman not long out of graduate school was met with disbelief and derision' (Diamond 1994) . Not only did Dr Friend prove to be correct, but Friend virus (FV) became a primary tool for studying viral leukemogenesis, oncology and host resistance to infection. In her original report, Dr Friend tested seven different strains of mice and found only two strains were susceptible to leukemia. This finding elicited a great deal of interest in determining the genetics of host susceptibility and resistance, but Mendelian studies were complicated by the fact that in most genetic crosses, susceptibility and resistance were controlled by multigenic factors (Fieldsteel, Dawson and Bostick 1961; Franker and Quilligan 1966; Mirand 1966; Mirand, Grace and Buffett 1966; Lilly 1967) . In the mid 1960s, Frank Lilly mapped the first FV susceptibility trait to chromosome 17, linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the mouse (Lilly, Boyse and Old 1964; Lilly 1966) . This was only the second viral susceptibility trait ever mapped. At that time, the MHC was known to control graft acceptance and rejection between mouse strains, but the mechanisms of action were not understood, and the link to virus susceptibility and resistance was very intriguing. Then in 1974, landmark papers by Zinkernagel and Doherty elucidated the connection between the MHC and T cell responses to viral infection. Their studies suggested that discrimination between self and non-self in tissue grafts extended to T cell recognition of 'altered self' in virally infected cells (Zinkernagel and Doherty 1974a,b) , a phenomenon now understood to be a viral peptide (non-self) bound to MHC molecules (self). In collaboration with Jack Stimpfling in 1974, Bruce Chesebro used MHC recombinant mice to map an FV resistance trait to a specific gene within the MHC, H-2D b . Within the next few years the immunological mechanisms of genetic resistance were uncovered, including roles for H-2D brestricted T cell responses (Friedman, Lilly and Nathenson 1974; Blank, Freedman and Lilly 1976; Chesebro and Wehrly 1976a,b; Chesebro and Wehrly 1978; Plata and Lilly 1979) and Rfv3-dependent B cell responses Chesebro et al. 1981) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 433, "text": "(Diamond 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 995, "end": 1032, "text": "(Fieldsteel, Dawson and Bostick 1961;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1060, "text": "Franker and Quilligan 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1073, "text": "Mirand 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF171"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1105, "text": "Mirand, Grace and Buffett 1966;", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 1106, "end": 1117, "text": "Lilly 1967)", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 1275, "end": 1302, "text": "(Lilly, Boyse and Old 1964;", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1314, "text": "Lilly 1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1937, "text": "(Zinkernagel and Doherty 1974a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2377, "text": "(Friedman, Lilly and Nathenson 1974;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2409, "text": "Blank, Freedman and Lilly 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2410, "end": 2438, "text": "Chesebro and Wehrly 1976a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2439, "end": 2464, "text": "Chesebro and Wehrly 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2465, "end": 2486, "text": "Plata and Lilly 1979)", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 2523, "end": 2544, "text": "Chesebro et al. 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FRIEND VIRUS INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "As immunological studies moved into the era of molecular immunology, several key findings allowed the development of tools that enabled the study of FV resistance at a much more detailed and mechanistic level. The discovery that MHC molecules presented peptides to T cells (reviewed in van Bleek and Nathenson (1992) ; Blum, Wearsch and Cresswell (2013) and Roche and Furuta (2015) ) led to the identification of the FV DbGagL peptide presented by H-2D b class I molecules (Chen et al. 1996) , and the FV env 122-141 peptide presented by H2-A b class II molecules (Iwashiro et al. 1993; Shimizu et al. 1994) . These peptide identifications further enabled the development of tetramers to quantify FV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Schepers et al. 2002) as well as the development of TCR transgenic mice carrying CD8+T cells specific for DbGagL (Ohlen et al. 2002) and CD4+ TCR transgenic mice specific for FV env 122-141 . Use of these immunological tools has greatly advanced the discovery of immunological mechanisms of resistance to FV infection with relevance to human immunity in several chronic viral infections. In addition to the adaptive immune responses required for resistance to FV, innate and alelles provide for the best CD8+ T cell responses. The H-2 b alelle of MHC class II gene, H-2A is also resistant. H-2 b/b homozygous mice are more resistant than heterozygous mice (Hasenkrug et al. 1994) . 2 The r alelle is resistant (LF-Stk), s is susceptible (SF-Stk). FV2 susceptibility is dominant because one copy of the SF-Stk gene product allows interaction with SFFV gp55, which induces erythroproliferation, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly 3 The r alelle is resistant, s is susceptible.

F-MuLV is classified as a simple gammaretrovirus with a standard arrangement of 2 LTRs flanking gag, pol and env genes (Troxler, Ruscetti and Scolnick 1980 ). An alternate CUG start site (Prats et al. 1989 ) is used to produce an additional protein, glycosylated gag (glycogag), which is expressed on viral particles and the surface of infected cells (Evans, Dresler and Kabat 1977; Fujisawa et al. 2001; Nitta et al. 2010) . Interestingly, the defective SFFV is the predominant pathogenic component in FV infection of adult mice. SFFV encodes a defective env protein (gp55) with oncogenic properties (Li et al. 1987; Li and Baltimore 1991) . The gag and pol genes of SFFV are also defective so SFFV must co-infect a cell infected with replication competent F-MuLV (helper) in order for the SFFV genome to get packaged and form transducing virions. The cellular tropism of FV is broad and FV can infect any dividing cell except hepatocytes, which do not express the mCAT-1 receptor for viral entry (Closs et al. 1993) . That said, the preferred target for FV is nucleated erythroid precursors. Spread of virions is greatly enhanced by the binding of SFFV gp55 to the erythropoietin receptor and the short form of the stem cell kinase receptor (SF-Stk, previously known as Fv2) (Li et al. 1987; Persons et al. 1999; He et al. 2010) . These gp55/Epo-Stk interactions deliver potent proliferative signals to nucleated erythroid progenitors significantly magnifying the erythroid target population of dividing cells and resulting in gross splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and bone marrow hypertrophy. In fact, mice with the long form of Stk (LF-Stk), which does not interact with gp55, are highly resistant to FVinduced splenomegaly and disease (Table 1) . FV also infects B cells and myeloid cells, whereas infection levels of T cells are much lower (Windmann et al. 2019) . In resistant mice, infected erythroid precursors are efficiently eliminated by T cells, but the infected immune cell populations can partly escape from T cell killing. Infected T and B cells subsequently accumulate in B cell follicles (Windmann et al. 2019) , a specific immunological niche that cytotoxic cells usually can't excess and that also harbors the viral reservoir in HIV infected humans or SIV infected monkeys (Connick et al. 2014; Fukazawa et al. 2015) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 291, "text": "(Kabat 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 413, "end": 449, "text": "(Troxler, Ruscetti and Scolnick 1980", "ref_id": "BIBREF245"}, {"start": 481, "end": 499, "text": "(Prats et al. 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 645, "end": 676, "text": "(Evans, Dresler and Kabat 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 677, "end": 698, "text": "Fujisawa et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 699, "end": 717, "text": "Nitta et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 895, "end": 911, "text": "(Li et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 912, "end": 934, "text": "Li and Baltimore 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1311, "text": "(Closs et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1587, "text": "(Li et al. 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1608, "text": "Persons et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1624, "text": "He et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2157, "text": "(Windmann et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF253"}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2417, "text": "(Windmann et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF253"}, {"start": 2582, "end": 2603, "text": "(Connick et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2604, "end": 2625, "text": "Fukazawa et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2029, "end": 2038, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "FRIEND VIRUS INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "In susceptible mice that fail to mount rapid T helper cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell responses, the SFFV genome eventually integrates into and activates the Spi-1 transcriptional factor gene (Moreau-Gachelin, Tavitian and Tambourin 1988; Paul et al. 1989; Lavigueur and Bernstein 1991; Paul et al. 1991; Schuetze et al. 1992; Hegde, Hankey and Paulson 2012) , inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor gene (Munroe, Peacock and Benchimol 1990; Johnson and Benchimol 1992; Johnson, Chung and Benchimol 1993) , and produces a malignant erythroleukemia in a multistage manner (Cmarik and Ruscetti 2010) .

Whereas highly susceptible strains of mice such as Balb/c never recover from acute FV infection and develop rapid erythroleukemia, resistant mice recover from acute infection within a few weeks, but then go on to develop a life-long chronic infection. Thus, resistant mice are powerful tools to not only study mechanisms of resistance to acute infection, but also mechanisms by which retroviruses evade complete eradication and establish and maintain chronicity. Such mechanisms of immunological resistance to acute infection ranging from intrinisic immunity to innate and adaptive immunity will be discussed. Studies of chronic FV in resistant mouse strains yielded the first insights that responses by CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppressed critical CD8+ T cell responses during infections and thereby promoted the establishment of chronic FV (reviewed in Hasenkrug, Chougnet and Dittmer (2018) ).

Since in vivo passaged FV complex was always more virulent than cultured virus stocks from cloned viruses, studies requiring highly pathogenic virus were historically done using mouse-passaged swarm stocks. An unintended consequence of the use of in vivo passaged stocks was the propagation of an endemic mouse virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). Evidence indicated that LDV was present in FV stocks as early as 1963 (Riley 1963) and may have been a component of the FV complex from its first isolation. LDV is a positive-stranded, enveloped RNA virus classified in the order Nidovirales, which also contains coronaviruses (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003) . Its name derives from its capacity to rapidly infect and cytolyse a subset of macrophages that clear excess lactate dehydrogenase from the circulation (Inada and Mims 1985) . LDV induces rather dramatic effects on the immune system. Among the reported effects are impaired antigen presentation by macrophages (Isakov, Feldman and Segal 1982) , polyclonal B cell activation (Coutelier and Van Snick 1985) , NK cell activation (Markine-Goriaynoff et al. 2002) , impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (Inada and Mims 1986) , and inhibited cellular immune responses (Howard et al. 1969) . These immunosuppressive effects of LDV allow FV titers to reach much higher levels before the infection comes under immunological control (Robertson et al. 2008a; Duley et al. 2012) . Consequently, much lower doses of FV were required to establish chronic FV infections in the presence of LDV than in its absence.

During acute FV infection, TLR3 is an important sensor involved in the control of viral replication (Gibbert et al. 2014 ). Up to 10 days post FV infection, mice deficient in TLR3 had significantly higher viral loads compared to wild-type mice (Gibbert et al. 2014) . During acute FV infection, TLR3 signaling was critical for the activation of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), which subsequently resulted in increased cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells and natural killer (NK) cells mediating the reduction in viral loads. In contrast, TLR7 and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), an important adaptor molecule for the signaling pathway of all TLR family members, except TLR3, were not required for viral control during initial FV infection. However, after 2 weeks of FV infection MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice failed to control the virus due to an impaired humoral immune response (Browne and Littman 2009; Kane et al. 2011; Gibbert et al. 2014 ). MyD88 and TLR7-dependent sensing of murine leukemia viruses (MLV) was crucial for the development of neutralizing antibody responses, but T cell responses were only partially dependent on this pathway (Browne and Littman 2009; Kane et al. 2011) . TLR3 is mainly expressed by myeloid DCs, indicating that antigen presenting cells are primarily activated by TLR3, whereas TLR7 is highly expressed by different B cell subsets, and thus the humoral immune response depends on TLR7 signaling. Indeed, another study showed that TLR7 is an important sensor in FV infection that facilitates the induction of germinal center B cells (Browne 2011) . Also, CD4 + helper T cell responses are diminished in FV-infected TLR7 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whereas CD8 + T cell responses are TLR7 independent (Browne 2011) . In a subsequent study, the same authors suggested that TLR7 sensing might also be critical during early FV infection because TLR7 sensing influenced IgM antibody production, but the differences in viral loads between TLR7 \u2212/\u2212 and wildtype mice were rather small (Browne 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 399, "end": 419, "text": "(Gibbert et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 543, "end": 564, "text": "(Gibbert et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1202, "text": "(Browne and Littman 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1220, "text": "Kane et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1240, "text": "Gibbert et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1470, "text": "(Browne and Littman 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1488, "text": "Kane et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 1868, "end": 1881, "text": "(Browne 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2030, "text": "(Browne 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2295, "end": 2308, "text": "(Browne 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "VIRUS SENSING"}, {"text": "Recent work implies that retroviral reverse transcripts are also detected by cellular DNA sensors such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), DExD/H-box helicase 41 (DDX41) and interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16).

Alternatively, deposition of complement fragments on the pathogen's surface enhances clearance by phagocytosis (Carroll and Isenman 2012) . Besides its role in innate immunity, the complement system bridges the innate and adaptive immune response and is involved in antibody maturation, memory B-cell formation and modulation of T cell responses (Carroll and Isenman 2012; West, Kolev and Kemper 2018) . Retroviruses can activate the complement system by either direct or Ab-independent interaction with C1q, the first component of the classical pathway (Ebenbichler et al. 1991; Stoiber et al. 1994 ). In addition, interactions of retroviruses with the mannose-binding lectin, the initial trigger of the lectin pathway, were described (Thielens, Tacnet-Delorme and Arlaud 2002; Ji, Gewurz and Spear 2005) . After seroconversion, pathogen-specific antibodies further trigger complement activation by initiating the classical complement pathway. As complement proteins are expressed in nearly all compartments of the host, invading pathogens are confronted with this first line of immune defense from the very beginning of an infection. To avoid complement-mediated virolysis retroviruses have adapted two main strategies. Similar to the host cell, viruses bind fluid-phase regulators of complement activation (RCAs), such as factor H (fH), on their surface to avoid destruction by activated complement. This defense strategy was shown for human-and simian-derived retroviruses (Freissmuth, Dierich and Stoiber 2003; Miller-Novak et al. 2018 ), but also for F-MuLV (Housiaux, Hill and Petersen 1988) . In addition, incorporation of membrane-anchored RCAs such as CD55 or CD59 into the viral membrane during the budding process shields against complement attacks. Several retroviruses found in primates take advantage of this defense mechanism (Montefiori et al. 1994; Saifuddin et al. 1995; Spear et al. 1995; Stoiber et al. 1996) . As shown for Mouse Mammary Tumor viruses (MMTV) and F-MuLV, murine retroviruses adapt CD55 and CR1-related gene/protein/Y (Crry), an RCA specific for rodents (H.S. unpublished observation).

Indeed, F-MuLV-reactive CD4+ T cells demonstrate robust follicular helper (Tfh) differentiation, which can be much stronger than that of CD4+ T cells responding to other viral infections (Ploquin, Eksmond and Kassiotis 2011; Danelli, Donnarumma and Kassiotis 2018) . F-MuLV-reactive CD4+ T cells also promote cellular immunity. Although dispensable for priming of F-MuLV-reactive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cell help promotes survival of cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells (Nair et al. 2010) . Moreover, F-MuLV-reactive CD4+ T cells exhibit direct antiviral activity, independently of other arms of adaptive immunity (Hasenkrug, Brooks and Dittmer 1998; Iwashiro et al. 2001b ). CD4+ T cells have long been shown to mediate rejection of FVinduced transplantable tumors, including those lacking MHC II expression (Greenberg, Cheever and Fefer 1981; Greenberg, Kern and Cheever 1985) .

FV-specific CD4+ T cells have also been shown to acquire cytotoxic activity against MHC II-expressing targets during chronic FV infection (Malyshkina et al. 2017) . This cytotoxic activity is FasL-dependent, whereas granzyme-dependent cytotoxicity, which can develop in response to F-MuLV env 124-138 immunization delivered by heterologous viral vectors (Donnarumma et al. 2016) , appears suppressed by CD4+ Tregs in the natural FV infection (Manzke et al. 2013; Malyshkina et al. 2017) .

All TCRs have to succeed through thymic selection, where excessive self-reactivity is a disadvantage.

The anti-viral activity of the CD8+ T cells is clearly associated with their ability to produce cytotoxic molecules. Activated FVspecific CD8+ T cells produce the granzymes A and B as well as perforin (Zelinskyy et al. 2005) , and execute efficient killing of GagL-presenting target cells in vivo (Zelinskyy et al. 2009a) .

We found that granulocytic MDSC restrict the functional activity of FV-specific CD8+ T cells and that this suppression involved arginase 1, PD-L1, and the ATP dephosphorylating enzyme CD39. In addition, NK cells were also able to suppress CD8+ T cell responses during the later phase of FV infection, but the molecular mechanisms remains to be determined (Littwitz et al. 2013 ). Thus, CD8+ T cell responses are strongly modulated/restricted during FV infection (Fig. 2) . Such tight control is necessary as overactive CD8+ T cells can be more dangerous for the host than the virus infection itself. The other edge of the sword though, is that suppression of the CD8+ T cell response can allow chronic infection to develop. From an evolutionary point of view, chronic infections often produce less severe selective pressures than immunopathology.

The importance of these antibodies was demonstrated in studies showing that passive antibody transfers of FV-specific antibodies could be protective against FVinduced leukemia (Wheelock et al. 1972) . However, passive antibody transfers only protected mouse strains that were also able to mount essential cell-mediated immune responses. Thus, depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells ablated antibodymediated protection (Hasenkrug, Brooks and Chesebro 1995a) . In 1979, it was found that the ability of different mouse strains to mount virus-neutralizing antibody responses was controlled by a single autosomal, non-MHC gene. The gene was termed Rfv-3 (Recovery from Friend virus gene 3) and was shown to be essential for control of viremia and prevention of leukemia Britt and Chesebro 1983) . Further studies revealed that mice depleted of CD4+ T-cells in vivo showed undetectable FV-neutralizing antibody responses, high viremia and reduced survival times. Thus, CD4+ T-helper cells were required for the Rfv-3-controlled FV-neutralizing antibody responses, including IgM responses (Super et al. 1998 ). These T helper cells are now known to be Follicular T helper or Tfh cells (Kassiotis and O'Garra 2009) , and FV infections induce a strongly biased differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Tfh cells (Danelli, Donnarumma and Kassiotis 2018) . Microsatellite mapping experiments undertaken in an effort to determine the identity of the Rfv-3 gene showed that it mapped to a 20 centimorgan region of chromosome 15 (Hasenkrug et al. 1995b) , and further studies narrowed the location to a 0.83 centimorgan region (Super et al. 1999; Kanari et al. 2005) . The identified region was very gene rich though, containing at least 61 genes unlinked to the MHC, the immunoglobulin loci or T cell receptor loci. One gene of particular interest, Mouse APOBEC3 (see chapter 3.2), exhibited striking functional polymorphisms that correlated with the Rfv3 phenotype of inbred mouse strains. Rfv3 resistant mice such as B6 express a truncated mA3 protein lacking exon 5 that is more resistant to retroviral protease (Abudu et al. 2006; Li et al. 2012) .

The indirect effect is linked to the unique mechanism by which mA3 to restricts acute FV replication. It was shown that although mA3 decreased titers of infectious virus during acute FV infection, plasma viral RNA loads were maintained . These findings indicated that mA3 restriction promoted neutralizing antibody responses by maintaining high concentrations of virions with native B cell epitopes, but in the context of low virion infectivity. The direct effect of mA3 on antibody responses is through somatic hypermutation. Somatic hypermutation is an integral process in the affinity maturation of antibodies important for the development of the highly avid antibodies necessary for protection from viral infections. Somatic hypermutation occurs via the enzymatic activity of activation-induced deaminase (AID), and enzyme evolutionarily related to mA3. However, in contrast to AID, which prefers to mutate deoxycytidines preceded by a purine, all APOBEC3 members, including mA3, preferentially mutate deoxycytidines preceded by a pyrimidine (Chelico, Pham and Goodman 2009) . Studies showed that mA3 complemented AID in driving immunoglobulin gene somatic hypermutation during retrovirus infection. This revealed a novel mechanism through which mA3 promoted the neutralizing antibody responses essential for recovery from retroviral infection (Halemano et al. 2014) . Apobec-mediated somatic hypermutation may also be relevant in HIV-1 vaccine development, as most broadlyneutralizing antibodies that achieve cross-clade HIV-1 neutralization are heavily mutated.

In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the kinetics and production levels of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and also reduced FV viremia.

Thus, depletion of Tregs, even in na\u00efve mice, strongly upregulates costimulatory molecule expression on B cells and enhances their APC function for CD8+ T cell priming (Moore et al. 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 373, "end": 391, "text": "(Bila et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 480, "end": 497, "text": "Shen et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF222"}, {"start": 851, "end": 870, "text": "(Moore et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1067, "text": "(Ploquin, Eksmond and Kassiotis 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1409, "text": "(Moore et al. 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF174"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "B cell responses and antibodies"}, {"text": "As discussed earlier, FV infections induce the activation and proliferation of Tregs with immunosuppressive activity for both T cells and B cells. Unexpectedly, the FV-induced Treg response is dependent on B cells, which provide essential signals for Treg expansion during FV infection (Fig. 2) . Treg responses are greatly diminished in B cell-deficient mice but can be restored by adoptive transfers of B cells at the time of infection. The feeble Treg responses in B cell-deficient mice are associated with enhanced virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses and accelerated virus control during the first 2 weeks of infection. In vitro experiments demonstrated that B cells promote Treg activation and proliferation through a glucocorticoid-induced receptor superfamily member 18 (GITR) ligand-dependent mechanism. Thus, B cells play paradoxically opposing roles during FV infection. They provide proliferative signals to immunsuppressive Tregs, which slows early virus control through suppression of T cell and B cell responses, and they also produce virus-specific antibodies, which are essential for long-term virus control (Moore et al. 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1125, "end": 1144, "text": "(Moore et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF173"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 286, "end": 294, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "B cell responses and antibodies"}, {"text": "Another interesting interaction between lymphocyte subsets responding to FV infections is that the expansion of Tfh cells, which is necessary to promote B cell responses, is enhanced by the presence of Tregs.

Thus, on one hand, FV-induced expansion of Tregs enhances Tfh differentiation thereby promoting antibody responses, but on the other hand, the B cell response is suppressed by FV-induced Tregs as discussed above.

In the acute phase, one of the first anti-viral effectors is type I IFNs, which are sometimes used to treat viral infections in the clinic. Since FV induces only a very weak endogenous type I IFN response upon infection, exogenous IFN\u03b1 was thought to be an interesting approach of immunotherapy and also an interesting model to test the hypothesis that different IFN\u03b1 subtypes would have varying efficacies in virus control. Indeed, certain IFN\u03b1 subtypes were able to restrict acute FV replication in vivo (Gerlach et al. 2009; Gibbert et al. 2012) . The mechanisms of action were most likely the direct induction of anti-viral restriction factors (see chapter 3.1), but also the immunomodulatory properties of IFN\u03b1. Mouse IFN\u03b14 was able to augment early FV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, whereas IFN\u03b11 and \u03b111 mainly activated NK cell responses (Gerlach et al. 2009; Gibbert et al. 2012) . Similar findings were made when IFN Antibodies, CD8+ T cells (Stromnes et al. 2002 ) (Duley et al. 2012) responses were induced by TLR ligands rather than IFN\u03b1 injections. Here TLR-9 (Olbrich et al. 2002) and TLR-3 ligands (Gibbert et al. 2010 ) mediated IFN-dependent direct anti-viral activity as well as stimulatory effects on virus-specific T cells. Beside IFN\u03b1 subtypes, other cytokines that enhance NK cell responses were shown to restrict initial FV replication, including IL-2 specifically targeted to NK cells (Littwitz-Salomon et al. 2015) and IL-15/IL-18 (Littwitz-Salomon, Dittmer and Sutter 2016; Littwitz-Salomon, Schimmer and Dittmer 2017a) . In contrast to IFN\u03b1, these effects exclusively relied on the activity of NK cells and no other immunological mechanisms were involved. Therapeutic effects during early FV infection could also be achieved by stimulating NKT cells with their exogenous activator \u03b1GalCer (Littwitz-Salomon, Schimmer and Dittmer 2017b) . Antibodymediated blockade of the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor on Tregs during acute FV infection produced faster Th1 responses and reduced virus loads and pathology. Interestingly, this immunotherapeutic also improved long-term CD8+ T cell functionality ). Although IFN\u03b3 is generally considered a potent antiviral cytokine, experiments in FV-infected mice co-infected with LDV demonstrated that LDV-induced IFN\u03b3 was actually detrimental to control of acute FV. Delivery of IFN\u03b3 -blocking antibodies during acute FV resulted in significantly reduced virus levels and better CD8+ T cell responses in the absence of IFN\u03b3 (Duley et al. 2012) . This negative effect of IFN\u03b3 on CD8+ T cells was indirect, not involving IFN\u03b3 receptors on the CD8+ T cells. Another effect of the IFN\u03b3 was to promote FV infection of B cells. Interestingly, the detrimental effects of IFN\u03b3 on early FVspecific immune responses were replaced at about 2 weeks post-infection by a requirement for IFN\u03b3 to maintain virus control, especially in terms of developing high titer, class-switched antibody responses (Stromnes et al. 2002) .

The combination of chronic antigen stimulation and suppression by Tregs and MDSCs establishes an immunosuppressive milieu that presents a complicated therapeutic situation. During the chronic phase of infection, the cytotoxic and cytokine-mediated antiviral activities of effector CD8+ T cells are largely incapacitated (Zelinskyy et al. 2005; Zelinskyy et al. 2009a) , although recent results indicate that a small subset of CD8+ T cells expressing SIRP\u03b1 remains functional (Myers et al. 2019) . Thus, immunotherapy in chronic viral infection mainly aims to restore the functionality of virusspecific T cells or expand the functional subsets. This concept is also very relevant for chronic human infections with viruses like HIV or HBV and for the treatment of cancers. We have shown that blocking inhibitory signals by Treg depletion , PD-1 antibody blockade (Dietze et al. 2013 ), or MDSC depletion (Drabczyk-Pluta et al. 2017 , results in reactivation of CD8+ T cells and significant reduction in chronic FV set points. Combination therapies targeting PD-1 and Tregs at the same time further improved this checkpoint immunotherapy (Dietze et al. 2013) . In addition to enhancing control of chronic virus by modulating suppression and co-inhibitory molecules, it was also shown that immunostimulatory therapies could be useful. Agonistic antibodies targeting the co-stimulatory molecule CD137 reactivated FV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells (Malyshkina et al. 2017; Malyshkina et al. 2019 ) and made them refractory to Treg suppression (Robertson et al. 2008b) . They could even reprogram Tregs into effector T cells that kill FVtransformed tumor cells (Akhmetzyanova et al. 2016) .

Such findings are important for the development of immunotherapies and vaccines. These areas of research were also informed by novel discoveries of immune regulation during chronic FV infection.

Effector CD8+ T cell responses can be suppressed by virus-activated NK cells, Tregs as well as gMDSCs.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Resistance (in decreasing order) of commonly used mouse strains for FV studies.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Resistance genes\n</td></tr><tr><td>Mouse strain (abbreviation) </td><td>MHC1 </td><td>FV22\n</td><td>Rfv3 (Apobec3)3\n</td></tr><tr><td>C57BL/10 (B10) </td><td>H-2b/b </td><td>FV2r/r </td><td>Rfv3r/r\n</td></tr><tr><td>C57BL/6 (B6) </td><td>H-2b/b </td><td>FV2r/r </td><td>Rfv3r/r\n</td></tr><tr><td>(A.BY x B10)F1 (Y10) </td><td>H-2b/b </td><td>FV2s/r </td><td>Rfv3s/r\n</td></tr><tr><td>(A/Wy x B10)F1 (Y10.A) </td><td>H-2a/b </td><td>FV2s/r </td><td>Rfv3s/r\n</td></tr><tr><td>(Balb/c x B10)F1 </td><td>H-2d/b </td><td>FV2s/r </td><td>Rfv3s/r\n</td></tr><tr><td>A.BY </td><td>H-2b/b </td><td>FV2s/s </td><td>Rfv3s/s\n</td></tr><tr><td>A/Wy </td><td>H-2a/a </td><td>FV2s/s </td><td>Rfv3s/s\n</td></tr><tr><td>Balb/c </td><td>H-2d/d </td><td>FV2s/s </td><td>Rfv3s/s\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Approaches for immunotherapy during acute and chronic FV infection.
