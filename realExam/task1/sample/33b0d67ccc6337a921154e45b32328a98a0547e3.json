Four HPIV serotypes (types 1-4) have been identified. Previous attempts to identify HPIV-4 have proved difficult as HPIV-4 has little cytopathic effect in culture, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) panels have not routinely included HPIV-4, and HPIV-4 serology is time consuming with limited commercial availability. As a result, most studies have focused primarily on types 1-3, leaving the epidemiology and clinical significance of HPIV-4 largely unknown [1] [2] [3] [7] [8] [9] . The recent development of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) capable of detecting HPIV-1-4 has aided in the detection of all HPIVs from respiratory specimens [10] . There are 2 subtypes of HPIV-4, 4a and 4b, both of which have been implicated in causing human disease [7] . Prior studies suggest that HPIV-4 may be associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, these studies have primarily been conducted outside North America and are limited by small sample sizes and often included patients with concurrent respiratory viral infections, making it difficult to assess the true clinical significance or epidemiology of HPIV-4 in pediatric patients.

Our study shows year-round prevalence of HPIV-4 with peaks in the autumn of odd-numbered years. Our study also demonstrates that parainfluenza viruses are common respiratory pathogens in children. The rate of parainfluenza virus detection was similar to both influenza and RSV during the study period. The rate of viral coinfection with HPIV-4 was high. Rhinovirus was the most frequently encountered coinfection, likely because rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus during the study period. The number of samples with \u22653 viruses detected was higher than previous studies have reported [12] . Clinical characteristics of patients in our study varied widely among parainfluenza types. Previous studies on HPIV-4 have reached varying conclusions about its clinical relevance. Some reports suggest that HPIV-4 has minimal clinical impact, whereas others find associations with significant illnesses [7, 11, 12, 14] . Most of these studies have had small sample sizes, did not exclude patients with concurrent viral infections, did not use sensitive detection methods, or relied on laboratory-developed PCRs that may have different performance characteristics [10, 12, [14] [15] [16] . Due to the large number of patients included in our study without any known coinfections, we were able to ascertain several clinical features of the virus. HPIV-4 was the only HPIV that did not cause croup. HPIV-4, along with HPIV-3, was associated with hypoxia, lower respiratory tract infections, abnormal radiographic findings, abnormal lung findings, and neurologic presentation. This is well demonstrated in the literature for HPIV-3 and has been suggested for HPIV-4, although minimal data are available [7, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In agreement with other studies, we found an association of HPIV-1-4 with febrile seizures in otherwise healthy children [19] . CRP was mildly elevated for both HPIV-3 and -4. Elevated CRP has been reported with HPIV infection, although not for specific HPIV types [3] . There was an increased incidence of otitis media in HPIV-4; however, numbers were low.

Use of rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing such as PCR for respiratory viruses has the potential to limit additional diagnostic studies and decrease the use of antibiotics in children. Previous studies have suggested that for children without underlying medical conditions, rapid testing for viral respiratory pathogens does not change diagnostic testing, admission rates, length of stay, or antibiotic use [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, many of these tests were not rapid enough to impact clinical care, and rapid diagnostic testing, such as rapid PCR, may be more useful in directing diagnostic testing and treatment in medically complex patients, although its role has not been fully explored.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 706, "end": 710, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 711, "end": 715, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 716, "end": 720, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "There are several limitations to this study. The study was performed at a large tertiary care children's hospital, most likely selecting the more seriously ill patients with HPIV infections. Underlying medical conditions are also likely higher in this population compared to the general population. Clinicians' decision to test for viral infection and, at the beginning of our study, the initial use of DFA as opposed to RVP in non-critical care settings may cause selection bias toward children with increased severity of symptoms. Therefore, our data do not necessarily reflect the overall burden of HPIV respiratory disease in the general pediatric population. Additionally, the availability of RVP results may have influenced clinicians' medical decision making with regards to diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition. We also acknowledge that the presence of viral RNA in a respiratory specimen does not always reflect the cause of current symptoms. It is possible that some patients had a positive RVP result due to prolonged shedding from a prior unrelated infection or asymptomatic carriage of a virus with signs and symptoms due to another disease process or infectious agent [28] [29] [30] .
