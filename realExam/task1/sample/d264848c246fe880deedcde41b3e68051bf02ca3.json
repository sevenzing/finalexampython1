            "text": "The Situation in Northern Italy. The epicenter of the current epidemic in Italy, the Lombardy region, is fighting a hard battle against an invisible enemy, the propagation of SARS-CoV-2. At the time of writing (March 17, 2020) 1 the region registers more than half (51%) of the total national confirmed cases (31.506) with a fatality rate at almost 8%. Of special concern, in general, and for me personally, is the situation in the province of Bergamo, with almost 4000 cases (3993) and many fatalities (460, almost 12%), where two small towns not far from where I was born and raised are paying a brutal toll. Of little comfort is the knowledge that the majority of infected people (up to 80%) are likely asymptomatic and go by undetected, as revealed by a study conducted in the small village of Vo' Euganeo (not far from Padua), where all 3000 residents were tested after lockdown. 2 These results mirror those recently published by Li and co-workers. 3 Teaching and Academic Research in Milan. This balance and the constant sound of the ambulance sirens is weighing heavily on our minds when thinking about keeping doing science. At the University of Milan, where I work, since the 24th of February we have been caught up in a crescendo of restrictive measures, at first stopping on-site lectures and then locking research laboratories 2 weeks later. Even professors and assistant professors have been discouraged from accessing the site for preparing or carrying out online teaching: please do it from home. Only essential in-person activities, such as refills of cryogenic gases to NMR instruments, are currently authorized in our department.",

This of course leads to personal concerns about being able to fulfill the commitment made upon receiving both national and European funding. Not less worrying is that the must of social distancing, if long lasting, would negatively impinge on the intrinsically collective nature of research groups. Returning to business as usual might not be as straightforward as one might think. As a society, especially for the younger generations, a useful lesson would be realizing that social media cannot fully substitute human contact and face-to-face talking.",

Even before the appearance of COVID-19 cases in Italy, a group led by Prof. Zehender at the University of Milan performed a temporal reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. 7 The results suggest that the epidemic originated between October and November 2019, a few weeks before the identification of the first cases. We now know that this is spot on, since the first confirmed case reported has been fixed at November 17th. 8 Analysis of the reproduction number R of the virus (i.e., the number of secondary cases induced by a single infected individual) increased in December 2019, leading to the current pandemic ( Figure 2 ). R usually decreases over the course of an epidemic, due to the reduced number of susceptible individuals, but in this case the increase might be due to the acquisition of a more efficient human-to-human transmission trait (i.e., via the now infamous droplets).",

This is the fundamental question that two colleagues of the University of Milan, Prof. Bollati and Dr. Milani, are trying to answer. They designed a study to determine whether a large cohort of asymptomatic people already have circulating antibodies against the virus, both short-term response and memory antibodies. In parallel, volunteers will be tested for the presence, in the respiratory tract, of the virus itself. This will lead, in the first place, to an understanding of whether the virus had been circulating long before the outbreak of the epidemic (allowing the immune system to generate a long-term immune response in some individuals) and, second, to a cross-checking of the results of swabs and detection of false negatives. The results will need to be interpreted cautiously. Indeed, viral RNA quantification is an established diagnostic tool, but the interpretation of the presence of specific antibodies is still under debate, as it is currently unknown whether they will confer long-term immunity against future infections. The protocol for safe sample collection (timing of individual appointments and access to the dedicated location) has been designed in collaboration with the Italian Association of Blood Donors (AVIS). The call for voluntary participation to all the people working at the university registered more than 1500 volunteers in less than 24 h. The study, named UNICORN (UNIversity against CORoNavirus), funded by the University of Milan, has already obtained ethics committee approval and is ready to start as soon as citizens' mobility restrictions are lifted.",
