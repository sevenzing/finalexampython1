The iatrogenic HIV infection scandal refers to a series of cases of infection with the human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, caused by the failure to apply safety measures to blood products. Included in these blood products were coagulationfactor products, which are pharmaceuticals effective against hemophilia. The raw material for these products is prepared from the blood of many donors, and the lack of a procedure for virus inactivation left no defense against viral infection. The reported discovery of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981 led to concerns over the risk of infection through blood products, but despite the warnings from many specialists, the use of these products continued and resulted in some 2,000 cases of HIV infection. According to a 1997 White Paper from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, of the 4,028 people with HIV as of February 1997, 1,872 had been infected by blood products. Meanwhile, of the 1,484 people who had developed AIDS symptoms, 641 had been infected by blood products. The reality was that almost half of those with HIV infection were victims of the scandal. This affair raised issues regarding the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing by the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the culpability of the involved organizations and individuals in industry (pharmaceutical manufacturers); in government (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare); and in academia (the AIDS Research Group led by Dr. Z).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 155, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Worldwide HIV Hazard"}, {"text": "Iatrogenic HIV infection differs from many other cases of iatrogenic drug damage in that it is a 'progressive condition'. What this means is that even when use of the drugs stops, the progression of the symptoms does not. This is because iatrogenic HIV infection arises not from the drug's side-effects, as with most other cases of iatrogenic drug damage, but from viral contamination of the blood that is the raw material for the drugs (Osaka HIV) [6] . In the absence of effective therapy, HIV causes a gradual weakening of the immune system, leading to the onset of AIDS. As of July 1998, there had been 493 deaths from iatrogenic HIV infection, while the number infected was 1,434, of whom 631 had developed AIDS. The number of deaths continues to increase. The fact that many children were affected is another distinctive feature of iatrogenic HIV infection, making all the more urgent the task of limiting the damage and developing therapies. Of those affected, 14 % were 10 years old or younger, while 30 % were 15 years or below, and those aged 20 or below accounted for more than half of all victims. This is why, in the first report by the Research Group for Preventive Therapies for People with HIV Infection, the group's chief researcher, Professor K. Yamada, called iatrogenic HIV infection \"one of the greatest medical tragedies of this century\". The group's report is subtitled The AIDS Scandal [7] . Table 5 .1 summarizes the iatrogenic HIV problem in terms of the number of HIV-infected people and the (estimated) number infected by blood products in the major developed countries. The number of people infected iatrogenically through pharmaceuticals is particularly high in the United States and France, indicating that the damage was spread through a combination of natural and human-made disasters. In many countries including Japan, court actions were brought against the government and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In Spain, where 90 % of bloodcoagulant products were imports from the United States, it is reported that 82 % of the 2,700 hemophiliacs became infected with HIV (Osaka HIV) [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 449, "end": 452, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1413, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2114, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1416, "end": 1423, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Spread of HIV Infection through Pharmaceutical Drugs"}, {"text": "In the case of the 'non-heat-treated' coagulation-factor products which were the medium of infection, although there were safety issues involved, the fact remained that they were effective for many hemophiliacs and user-friendly.

Moreover, self-injection of coagulation-factor products by hemophiliacs was authorized in February 1983, offering a greater degree of user-friendliness than cryoprecipitate, which in principle had to be administered in a hospital.

The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had collected information from overseas specialists, but this information was not communicated to medical treatment institutions, patients, or the general public. At the time of the first confirmed case, the Ministry tried to prepare a 'soft landing' for AIDS in Japan. Similarly, so as to avoid panic among the public and unequal treatment of companies, it continued to advocate a softly-softly approach. In court, too, the government went on to adopt the role of director and defender of the accused companies. In addition to this aspect, there was a strong significance attached to the fact that the disease was infectious, which meant that the damage spread through secondary and tertiary infection. Surprisingly, as the Ministry initially treated HIV as a public health and sanitation issue, it did not provide victims with medical treatment, relief or compensation, thinking of the infection rather as a social evil which needed to be rooted out and eliminated.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Spread of HIV Infection through Pharmaceutical Drugs"}, {"text": "Detailed information on the timeline of the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal has appeared on the website of Life AIDS Project and in a book by Hitoshi Sakurai entitled Umoreta eizu h\u014dkoku (The Buried AIDS Report) [9] .

Cryoprecipitates products were used as drugs to control the disease [10] . As cryoprecipitate products are made from the pooled blood of one or at the most ten individuals, it was expected that they would be less likely to cause infection than coagulation-factor products, which are made from the pooled blood of between 2,000 and 20,000 people [11] . As the first cryoprecipitate were frozen products, their storage and use presented challenges, and patients had to be treated in hospital, but this problem was resolved by the dried cryoprecipitate developed in the early 1980s, and home treatment using cryoprecipitate did apparently take place in some cases. In countries such as Norway, which actually switched to cryoprecipitate, the rate of hemophiliac HIV infection was kept to low levels, indicating effective decision-making on health policy. This fact casts doubt on the basis of Dr. Z's statement that 'cryoprecipitate is liable to solidification', and instead points to the difference in drug-price markup as one of the possible reasons why the switch to cryoprecipitate was not realized. From 1984 until around 1985, many Japanese doctors viewed as specialists and many officials at the Ministry of Health and Welfare were apparently dominated by the 'logical argument' that \"although use of blood products can lead to HIV infection, many patients have not developed symptoms. Infection and onset of symptoms are thus separate phenomena. Although 'non-heated products' may be a cause of HIV infection, they do not act to cause AIDS onset\" [12] . AIDS is a disease of immune dysfunction caused by a virus called HIV. In a document published in 1986, Dr. Z maintained that confirmation of AIDS requires three conditions to be fulfilled [13] . The first was infection with the AIDS virus, which could be tested via the presence of antibodies. The second was reduced or insufficient immunocompetence. The fact that this reduction of immunocompetence occurs over time is one of the characteristics of AIDS. For reduced immune function to result in the onset of symptoms can take more than 10 years in many cases, until which time the patient may experience no more than a certain degree of fatigue, with no impairment of everyday activities. This is still one of the features that distinguish HIV infection from the onset of AIDS. The third of Dr. Z's conditions was opportunistic infection, which appears as a result of weakened immunocompetence in the form of illnesses such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma. As a result, medical treatment following the onset of AIDS consists of a constant battle with opportunistic infections. Figure 5 .2 shows the number of new HIV and AIDS infections and deaths in the two subsequent decades from 1990 to 2010. Many HIV-infected patients die each year; the total number of those infected is shown in the figure. When we consider also the number of AIDS deaths due to non-pharmaceutical-related natural infection, such as infection through unprotected sex or needle-sharing, the extent of the tragedy is immeasurable. The problem of iatrogenic AIDS thus continues into the present. In the case of iatrogenic HIV infection, the main point of legal contention was at what juncture pharmaceutical manufacturers and the Ministry of Health and Welfare had become aware of the risk from non-heated products. The case in point in the criminal trial was that of a liver-disease patient treated with non-heated products from the pharmaceutical company Green Cross Corporation in April 1986. The court attempted to trace why the president of the corporation had not recalled the products, and why Mr. Y, the then head of the Biologics and Antibiotics Division at the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, had not ordered a recall.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 283, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 556, "end": 560, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1763, "end": 1767, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1962, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2872, "end": 2880, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Background to Scandal"}, {"text": "Since pharmaceutical manufacturers were also in a position to access risk data, they were unable to deny their involvement in the manufacture and sale of drugs potentially contaminated with the virus. Information from pharmaceutical manufacturers was reported to the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, but was not communicated to the hemophiliacs who were the product consumers. The Ministry thereby clearly neglected its duty to warn patients and the public. As for non-heated products, while most other countries reduced their imports, Japan sought to increase imports and even reduced the price as an incentive. The reason for the import of unsafe 'non-heated products' was quite simply the prioritization of earnings from the markup on the drug price. This is the profit derived from the difference between the fixed domestic price for medical products and the price actually paid to the overseas supplier. The markup on non-heated products was particularly great. With cryoprecipitate products, in contrast, there was almost none. There are also issues associated with the actions of those involved after the danger was realized: even after heated products became available, they failed to urgently recall the non-heated products which they knew to be unsafe. By making false reports to the Ministry of Health and Welfare regarding the dates of market release and recall of non-heated products, the Green Cross Corporation engaged in fraud and misrepresentation compounding the damage, for which it bears a grave 'social responsibility.' Figure 5 .3, stakeholders of the pharmaceutical industry, presents a diagrammatic illustration of the interest groups in the industry involved in the administration of pharmaceutical approval and licensing. As shown, Green Cross effectively engaged in bribery, which included making payments, disguised as 'research funds', to a foundation that Dr. Z was in the process of establishing, suggesting that the 'business ethics' of this pharmaceutical operator were very poor. Its approach, which prioritized its own interest at the expense of patients and the public, aggravated the damage. However, this kind of poor practice was not restricted to the corporate players; responsibility also lies with the government authorities that administered the pharmaceutical regulatory system, which became ever clearer as the Japanese media (NHK) delved more deeply into the scandal.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1547, "end": 1555, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility"}, {"text": "The former Ministry of Health and Welfare had the role of providing supervision and guidance to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Notwithstanding its name change to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare following a ministerial reorganization, its historic responsibility for the iatrogenic HIV infection remains, together with its duty to compensate patients and victims. This raises the question of the political and administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities. Although it may not have been deliberately responsible, if it is the case that the former Ministry of Health and Welfare sacrificed the health of hemophiliacs for the sake of pharmaceutical manufacturers' profit, then the regulatory authority itself has become a malignant influence on society, a situation that calls for the establishment of an ethical code for government organizations. The pharmaceutical regulatory system has been called a 'web of vested interests'. The sorting of good medicines from bad is carried out under government guidance through a process known as pharmaceutical inspection, but, paradoxically, there is greater interest vested in bad medicines than in good medicines. Pharmaceutical companies make massive capital investment in drug development and have to adapt to new raw materials and a new production line for each new drug. They need to recoup this investment, and the development of a single drug is thus a kind of venture project that can determine the entire fate of the company.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility"}, {"text": "Because of this, once a drug had been developed, since it was no longer possible to halt the investment in the associated production plant, the company would approach official bodies and the specialist committees and research groups that ", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility"}, {"text": "The administrative responsibility of the regulatory authorities involved in the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal (the former Ministry of Health and Welfare) was the focus of the court case. In court, the basis for the questioning of the Ministry's responsibility was the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which was amended in 1979 in response to the SMON (subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy) case. The amendment gave the Ministry the authority to close down the supply of a pharmaceutical where there was the risk of it creating or aggravating a health or safety hazard. At issue was the failure to exercise this authority, in other words negligence on the part of the regulatory authority. Specifically, it can be pointed out, for instance, that Japan lagged behind the United States by 2 years and 4 months in the approval of heated products. This was largely attributable to the coordination of clinical studies by Dr. Z, but another probable issue was the structure whereby the former Ministry of Health and Welfare's pharmaceutical-licensing operation was dependent on a small number of specialists.

AIDS was first recognized in Japan on March 22, 1985, with the reporting of the case of a male homosexual resident in the United States, which became known as the Juntendo University case. The patient survived for 10 years after diagnosis, and, although infected with HIV, is thought to have been yet to develop AIDS at that time. In contrast, a hemophiliac who died in July 1983, known as the Teikyo University case, was not recognized as an AIDS patient. It has been claimed that this was because the former Ministry of Health and Welfare tried to conceal the fact of hemophiliac HIV infection. Even subsequent to the licensing of heated products, the Ministry exacerbated the damage by failing to order pharmaceutical manufacturers to recall unheated products. Underlying this lax leadership is a readily perceptible collusion between the former Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Green Cross Corporation of those days was described as an outpost of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, and the practice of amakudari, whereby officials from the Ministry frequently retired into sinecure positions with pharmaceutical manufacturers, led to the formation of strong collusive relationships in the area of pharmaceutical approval and licensing (Mainichi Shimbun Shakaibu) [14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1574, "end": 1578, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ghost Governance"}, {"text": "As shown in Fig. 5 .4, the background to the iatrogenic HIV infection scandal was formed not only by the various contributions of industry, government and academia, but also by the undeniable fact of mutual interorganizational relationships among the three based on an 'industrial protection policy' peculiar to what has been called Japan Inc.

The AIDS Research Group was in fact heavily involved in important decisions that led to the compounding of the damage from the iatrogenic HIV infection, such as the decision not to switch from coagulation-factor products to cryoprecipitate products. Specifically, at the meeting of the Home Treatment Promotion Committee on October 18, 1983, Dr. Z said in respect of his earlier claim that 'cryoprecipitate tends to solidify' that it might not be true. At a time when there were doubts over the safety of blood products, a grave responsibility attaches to his decisions not to switch to cryoprecipitate products, and then to delay the clinical study of the heated products when he should have been working to provide a safer drug as quickly as possible. In connection, it was found that doctors had had financial dealings with pharmaceutical manufacturers, which was proven by the fact that Green Cross had made donations, disguised as research funds, to a foundation established by Dr. Z. As part of the July 1997 reorganization of the pharmaceutical regulatory structure recommended in the 1997 Annual Report on Health and Welfare, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau was abolished, and the Health Policy Bureau took control of policy on the promotion of pharmaceutical research and development, pharmaceutical production and distribution, and related aspects. Meanwhile, the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau was created to oversee the broad range of safety measures relating to medical treatment and pharmaceuticals, such as pharmaceutical clinical studies, approval and inspection, post-marketing safety measures, and measures to prevent infection within medical-treatment institutions. In parallel, as part of a strategic upgrade and reorganization of testing and research institutions, the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences was reconstituted as the National Institute of Health Sciences, and was equipped with a Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center to promote survey and research work on the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs and strengthen pharmaceutical inspection. To coincide with the reorganization, there was a systematic increase in the number of staff assigned to pharmaceutical inspection work, and the inspection system was changed: whereas previously the actual work of inspection had been delegated to the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, whose members were drawn from the outside, the core work of pharmaceutical inspection was now to be carried out in-house by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Evaluation Center, with the Council's role specialized to cover high-level assessment. Urgent steps were to be taken to set up a corresponding system of responsibilities.

Under the previous system, Inspection Guidelines and Inspection Reports were submitted to the Investigation Committee of the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council, which was made up of specialists from outside the Ministry.

In future, lessons must be drawn from the iatrogenic HIV infection, and reform must be applied to the web of interests in the pharmaceutical industry and its system of cozy collusive relationships with government agencies. The poor practice and collusive relationships arising from the network of interests linking the worlds of industry and government also exemplify the need to reform, in terms of both policies and systems, the ethos and culture which became entrenched during Japan's earlier period of rapid economic growth. An existing organizational culture must not be allowed to prevent the organization from learning to find its way in a new age. Dismantling the old culture of the past and creating a new culture is an important process. The culture of poor practice which is latent within the pharmaceutical regulatory system and the pharmaceutical industry represents a form of 'organizational inertia' which still today retains the power to act against the public interest.

First of all, insufficient information disclosure allows an influx of people into the infection area; secondly, government measures to suppress infection and efforts at an organizational level by corporations or other bodies remain weak; and thirdly, there is a \"zone of indifference outside the infection area.\" These three factors create disregard for hazard information (de-civilization). Accurate publicity of 'socio-biological hazard' is therefore essential at the levels of international society, government, corporate organizations, and the individual, while also urgent are preventing unnecessary or unauthorized business visits or travel to the hazard area and other issues of organizational compliance and governance, together with Human Resource Management (HRM). The northward spread of tropical infectious diseases through global warming has created a need for social systems at various levels, including those of government, corporate organizations, and the individual. This means that the concept of an 'eco-civilization'-promoting coexistence at the level of the social ecosphere, and associated disclosure of information-is the only viable approach to suppressing the combination of human-made and natural disasters that constitute socio-biological outbreaks and pandemics.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral Outbreaks Caused by Global Warming: Limitations of Management and Policy"}, {"text": "In April 2002, eastern Asia was struck by the SARS virus.

At the time, I was due to leave for a period of external research at IMD Lausanne, and my office urged me to proceed with the departure from Kansai Airport despite the risk of spreading the SARS infection. However, I defied them and postponed the departure. It was precisely on the day of my scheduled departure that Kansai Airport was subjected to a major disinfection operation as a precaution against SARS. The decision to postpone my departure after consulting my departmental head was a close call. If I had left on that day, I may have spread the infection to my research host institution at the IMD, and the SARS infection could have been transmitted after my return to many of my students and teaching colleagues. The conclusion to be drawn from this episode is that, going forward, whatever the field of work and in the management of organizations of all kinds, response to viral outbreaks will become an urgent task for participants in and administrators of business travel.
