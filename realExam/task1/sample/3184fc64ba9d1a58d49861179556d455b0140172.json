A few empirical studies related to this pandemic have reported higher prevalence of mental health problems among women compared to men. 1 In this context, pregnant women and new mothers could certainly be more vulnerable. Are there psychological repercussions of this outbreak on maternal health? Are perinatal maternal mental health disorders an inevitable burden of this pandemic? Could this be averted with a proactive, multidisciplinary, integrated health services approach targeting the vulnerable population of pregnant women?",

Maternal mental health problems are associated with short-term and long-term risks for the affected mothers' overall health and functioning, as well as their children's physical, cognitive and psychological development. Conditions such as extreme stress, emergency and conflict situations, and natural disasters can inflate the risks of perinatal mental health morbidity. Therefore, it is plausible that pregnant women are vulnerable to mental ill-health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Pregnant women may be at risk of having more severe disease, preterm deliveries are more common, and maternal and neonatal mortalities have been reported. 4, 5 Furthermore, risk of miscarriage associated with COVID-19 remains unclear although the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) in a second trimester placenta has been demonstrated. 6 These uncertainties are likely to add to psychological stress and may even lead to increased rates of pregnancy terminations.",

This could create a problem as availability of qualified birth attendants and midwives to support home deliveries is limited, even in affluent countries, and may lead to increased maternal and neonatal complications. Although transmission of SARS-COV-2 through breast milk is unlikely, 7 some infected women may choose not to breast-feed temporarily to avoid direct contact with the newborn and reduce the risk of neonatal infection. However, such practices and early cessation of breastfeeding may contribute to poor health among mothers and infants. 8 Strict public health measures directed towards mitigating the spread of disease are necessary, but known to have negative psychological effects leading to stress, anger and confusion. 9 The prolonged pandemic chaos will inevitably have economic consequences, and financial uncertainties are likely to further escalate psychological burden and worsen the mental wellbeing of pregnant women and new mothers. Some individuals may resort to harmful methods of coping with the crisis, such as alcohol consumption and substance abuse, thus adding to existing mental health problems. This may also lead to an increase in gender-based intimate partner violence, reduction in preventive help seeking behavior, and increase in suicide rates with devastating results, especially among low-income families and immigrant communities.",

There appears to be a substantial knowledge gap, but also a reluctance to accept that the psychological wellbeing of pregnant women is important to care for during such a crisis.
