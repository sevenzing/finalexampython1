On Jan. 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency (WHO, 2020) . COVID-19 causes most damage to the respiratory system, leading to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. The confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) was estimated to be 5% to 8% (Jung et al., 2020) . Besides physical pain, COVID-19 also induces psychological distress, with depression, anxiety, and stress affecting the general population, quarantined population, medical staff, and patients at different levels (Kang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020) . Previous research on patients in isolation wards highlighted the risk of depressed mood, fear, loneliness, frustration, excessive worries, and insomnia (Abad et al., 2010) .",

For instance, women in late pregnancy were found to experience higher levels of anxiety, with typical symptoms including fear of anticipated childbirth (Zar et al., 2002) . For perinatal women who simultaneously suffer from infectious disease, worries around the fetus's health may further add to their own mental burden. Postpartum psychological well-being has been reported to be impaired by symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress due to infant appearance and parental role transition (Gambina et al., 2011; Holditch-Davis et al., 2015) . The literature has recorded a positive relationship between higher levels of maternal distress and worse infant healthiness, poorer mother-newborn attachment, as well as slower recovery from childbirth (Gress-Smith et al., 2012; Kingston et al., 2012) . Since preand postpartum psychological adjustments impose critical effect on both mother and infant's healthiness and development, it is crucial to provide prompt psychological intervention for women in late pregnancy and early postpartum suffering from COVID-19.",

Emotion regulation training resulted in the decrease of depressive and anxiety symptoms in a sample of university students (Fassbinder et al., 2016) . Acquisition of distress tolerance skills significantly improved the psychological well-being and reduced emotion reactivity among participants with bipolar disorder (Eisner et al., 2017) .

Major techniques used were non-judgmental listening and empathy skills. Psycho-education and COVID-19related knowledge were provided to soothe some of the patient's irrational or unreal thoughts. After the patient reached a more stable state, the basic DBT idea of \"change what can be changed, and accept what can be accepted\" was introduced. The therapist communicated mindfulness skills to the patient, which emphasized observation of feelings, thoughts, and body sensations without judging them or attempting to resist them. To replace traumatizing thoughts, the therapist guided the patient to think dialectically by listing both the negative and positive aspects of the current situation; as a result, the patient became aware and enlightened by the idea that even the worst thing has a bright side. After using these two techniques, the patient was able to experience her situation with less psychological pain. At the end of the session, the therapist taught the patient emotion regulation skills by leading her through a breathing and relaxation exercise.

Although SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing results of cord blood, amniotic fluid, and placenta samples were negative, further examination of the potential COVID-19 infection of the newborn was still needed to reach a final confirmation. Hence, she had to face the uncertainty of her baby's healthiness. These risk factors all contributed to the instability of mood during the first few days after laparotomy.

Her husband was also transferred to the same ward with her and provided her with support and care. However, the newborn baby was still accommodated in children's hospital and reunion time was undecided. Additionally, her daughter and close relatives were still quarantined. As for her own tests, sputum and stool SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests turned to negative on Feb. 11 and 14, respectively. However, the stool test indicated positive on Feb. 15, making her health condition unclear. Therefore, recurrent worries and fidgets continued to disturb the patient. Psychological scales also indicated the existence of depressive and anxious symptoms. The session began with a brief session of mindfulness breathing and relaxation. The patient expressed high approval of mindfulness skill, saying that it was effective in controlling anxious feelings. She told the therapist that she taught her husband to exercise mindfulness as well, which enhanced her self-efficacy. In addition to intrapersonal emotion regulation skills, the therapist introduced more interpersonal intervention into this session to enhance interpersonal support. The patient was encouraged to express her feelings and psychological needs to her husband, share similar feelings and thoughts, provide positive feedback to her husband, and also listen to what her husband wanted to say. Mutual caring and support techniques were provided to the patient, and some techniques were practiced in the session. In addition to support from family members, the therapist also reminded the patient that she had already received and continued to receive social support. Such support included special medical arrangement for childbirth, quickly-accomplished transition of her husband by both the original and current hospitals, special care provided for her baby by the children's hospital, as well as encouraging messages that numerous people left for her on social media below the news that a diagnosed mother gave birth to a baby.

The current report highlighted the importance of timely intervention for a patient influenced by infectious disease, and handled a complex situation where the patient faced child delivery at the same time. It also explored the effectiveness of a brief intervention on helping the patient cope with here-and-now psychological problems, and identified several DBT techniques that benefited the patient the most.",

For instance, comprehensive study on the mental health of pregnant patients suffering from infectious diseases should also be conducted. The effectiveness of DBT-based therapy urged further investigation on the role of DBT in trauma and crisis intervention. The current practice can be shifted to other populations that are influenced by public health crises. In this way, more populations who are at high psychological risk of suffering from trauma and crisis will benefit from DBT-based psychological intervention.",
