            "text": "Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) seem to be at increased risk for more severe COVID-19 infection and associated complications due to their immunocompromised state, the older age and comorbidities. The European Myeloma Network has provided an expert consensus statement in order to guide therapeutic decisions in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient education for personal hygiene and social distancing measures, along with treatment individualization, telemedicine and continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential. In countries or local communities where COVID-19 infection is widely spread, MM patients should have a PCR test of nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 before hospital admission, starting a new treatment line, cell apheresis or ASCT in order to avoid ward or community spread and infections. Oral agent-based regimens should be considered, especially for the elderly and frail patients with standard risk disease, whereas de-intensified regimens for dexamethasone, bortezomib, carfilzomib and daratumumab should be used based on patient risk and response. Treatment initiation should not be postponed for patients with end organ damage, myeloma emergencies and aggressive relapses. Autologous (and especially allogeneic) transplantation should be delayed and extended induction should be administered, especially in standard risk patients and those with adequate MM response to induction. Watchful waiting should be considered for standard risk relapsed patients with low tumor burden, and slow biochemical relapses. The conduction of clinical trials should continue with appropriate adaptations to the current circumstances. Patients with MM and symptomatic COVID-19 disease should interrupt anti-myeloma treatment until recovery. For patients with positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, but with no symptoms for COVID-19, a 14-day quarantine should be considered if myeloma-related events allow the delay of treatment. The need for surveillance for drug interactions due to polypharmacy is highlighted.",

The clinical presentation of the infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 varies significantly among the individuals and ranges from completely asymptomatic cases to potentially lethal respiratory infection and multi-organ damage [1] . The lack of herd immunity renders the population vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the case-fatality rate is not unanimous among different countries [2] . Increased age (65 years and above, especially 75 years and above), male gender, obesity and the presence of comorbidities are strong predictors of adverse outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [3] .",

In a hospital-based cohort of 338 patients with COVID-19 including 105 with coexistent malignancies, those with cancer had poorer survival (p = 0.02), had a higher chance of having at least one critical or severe manifestation (p < 0.01) and were more frequently admitted at the intensive care unit (p = 0.01) compared with those without any malignancy [4] . In another retrospective study including 28 cancer patients with COVID-19, the administration of antineoplastic treatment within 14 days from COVID-19 diagnosis was significantly associated with the risk for severe disease (HR = 4.08, p = 0.037) [5] . Chemotherapy or cancer-related surgery within 30 days from COVID-19 diagnosis has also been associated with increased risk for severe disease (OR = 5.34, p = 0.0026) [6] . Despite various methodological limitations mainly due to the retrospective design, a meta-analysis of available studies has confirmed these observations [7] . For this reason, PCR screening for COVID-19 has been proposed in patients with lung cancer who are going to start a new treatment and this may be used more extensively in other cancers soon [8] .",

            "text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the malignant proliferation of clonal plasma cells. The overproduction of a monoclonal component consisting of dysfunctional immunoglobulin, along with the suppressed levels of normal immunoglobulin classes, and the dysfunctional cellular and innate immunity, is the basis for the suboptimal immunological response of the host against pathogens. Renal impairment that is a frequent complication of the disease further contributes to the dysfunction of immune system and the development of infections and sepsis in MM [9] . Moreover, the current drug armamentarium against MM encompasses agents with substantial hematological toxicity, including neutropenia and lymphopenia [10] . Infections are a major source for morbidity and mortality among patients with MM [11] [12] [13] . Clinical studies have shown that patients under treatment with immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are at increased risk of severe infections [14, 15] . PIs impair T-cell function and are associated with varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. Although CD38 directed monoclonal antibodies reduce immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, they also deplete natural killer (NK) cells and increase the susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections [16, 17] . High dose of steroids and high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) further contribute to a immunocompromised state. Therefore, vaccination and prophylaxis with antivirals and antibiotics has been integrated in the management of patients with MM [18, 19] . Furthermore, patients with MM are typically older adults with several age-related comorbidities that have a significant impact on disease outcomes [20] . The multifactorial burden of cardiovascular disease is also substantial and may be aggravated by preexisting conditions, disease complications and drug toxicities [21] . In addition, individuals with MM are at an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) that may vary according to patient-, diseaseor treatment-related characteristics [22] .",

Hand hygiene and social distance are vital for preventing COVID-19 transmission, since there is no vaccine and no SARS-CoV-2-specific treatment available yet. Patients, caregivers and health professionals should be encouraged to wear a face mask when visiting the clinic or going outside home. Respiratory masks are the best way to prevent the disease from spreading through the air via coughs or sneezes. Surgical masks are recommended to those who are more likely to contract or already have the infection to avoid spreading it further. Masks such as FFP2 and FFP3 are ideal for those who are not yet ill, or health care professionals taking precaution to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 when working or being near those who may have symptomatic disease. Even 'self-made cloth masks' have been proposed to be used for the entire community in several countries, when distancing cannot be achieved, especially in not open-air areas. Telemedicine and novel technologies for remote communication are endorsed in order to reduce patient visits to the clinic. Blood examinations can also be preferred to be performed in a local laboratory instead of a high-volume hospital. In this case, caution should be made during the disease evaluation, because different laboratories may apply different techniques with distinct reference ranges, especially when determining free light chain levels. Unanticipated results should be confirmed in the reference laboratory.",

Alternative therapeutic approaches are recommended instead of a salvage ASCT or an allogeneic transplant. Should a patient with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) achieve sufficient response [e.g., very good partial response (VGPR) or better], modifications in the treatment schedule are advisable (once weekly instead of twice weekly bortezomib/carfilzomib and monthly daratumumab infusions). Substitution of bortezomib or carfilzomib with ixazomib, in cases of VGPR or better, is not recommended, as it is not supported by clinical studies. There are no data for isatuximab once monthly and thus in cases of combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in countries where the combination has been approved, the schedule of isatuximab administration has to remain unchanged (i.e., every two weeks) [50] . Similarly, elotuzumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone should be given according to protocol [51] .

Many agents that are being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2, including antivirals, (hydroxy)chloroquine, azithromycin and remdesivir, may have significant interactions with other drugs and may result in significant hepatic, cardiac or renal toxicity [18, 63, 64] . Therefore, close monitoring of organ function is important.",

Optimizing our therapeutic approach in the era of this global infection is extremely challenging, as we have to balance the risk of a potentially lethal infection with the risk of a potentially lethal and incurable disease, taking into consideration the restricted resources, which are largely dedicated to COVID-19 services. Tailoring our treatment to each individual separately along with continuous surveillance for early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections among patients with MM are considered essential. Accumulating data in order to provide evidence-based guidance is of equal importance. In this context, we strongly encourage the participation in international registries collecting data on patients with MM or cancer in general and COVID-19 infection. EMN has such a project led by Gordon Cook, which looks at the spread of COVID-19 in myeloma patients and their outcome. The American Society of Hematology's Research Collaborative data hub COVID-19 Registry, the International Myeloma Society registry, and the international COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium database are other registries where myeloma patients can participate.",

In Germany for example, there is very low impact on clinical trial recruitment and performance, as stem cell collection and stem cell transplantation is ongoing without disruption. However, we will probably have COVID-19 for the next 1-2 years before the availability of any vaccination/therapy, but we will be able to handle it increasingly better. Thus, recommendations must be updated and revisited frequently, when data will be more mature regarding registry analyses and with more knowledge regarding the impact of various anti-myeloma therapy on COVID-19.",
