Figure 3 shows how the viral replication-transcription complex is the product of the transcription apparatus which is housed in doublemembrane vesicles formed from subgenomic RNAs [2] . Open reading frames serve as templates for the production of the subgenomic mRNAs. In between these open reading frames, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences [2] . At least six open reading frames are present, including a frameshift able to block host innate immune response. The viral envelope, a structural protein, confers viral pathogenicity since it promotes viral assembly and release. However, many of these features (e.g., those of nonstructural protein 2, and 11 ) have not yet been described [2] .",

Very early after infection, hCoV reach high titers and sequester multiple proteins that inhibit the interferon response, suggesting that immune response delay or evasion may be the result of early antagonism of the interferon [11] . A dysfunctionally regulated inflammatory response and T-cell apoptotic sensitization is also further orchestrated by the delayed interferon signaling [11] . Some consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology are epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage, suboptimal T-cell response, in other words. CoV-specific T cells are crucial for virus clearance and limit further damage to the host. Additionally, T-cell responses also dampen overactive innate immune responses [11] . Exuberant inflammatory responses caused by pathogenic hCoV diminish the T-cell response, in the case of SARS CoV infection via TNF-mediated T-cell apoptosis, thus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory response; accumulation of alternatively activated macrophages and altered tissue homeostasis; and acute respiratory distress syndrome [11] . Figure 4 demonstrates the enormous immune response against the novel coronavirus [12] . The innate immune response and adaptive immunity have distinct responses to coronaviruses infection [12] . The SARS-Cov-2 (CoV) infects macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells and this process leads to T-cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T-cell subsets (i.e., T helper cells), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification [12] . The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on natural killer cells and CD8 + T-cell activation, and CD8 + T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV [6] .",

Additionally, after a TLR is activated by the corresponding PAMP, MyD88 recruits the receptor-related kinases IRAK4, IRAKI, IRAK2 and IRAK-M. IRAK4 plays an important role in activating NF-\u03baB and MAPKs downstream of MyD88. IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which causes its K-63 ubiquitination, and facilitates NEMO ubiquitination to activate NF-\u03baB, which may have implications for aberrant cell growth.

The MAPK signaling pathway, activated upon COVID-19 infection, is involved in the tumorigenesis of a number of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, adrenocortical cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer and pituitary adenomas. The Ras/MAPK pathway is activated in 50-100% of human hepatocellular carcinomas and is correlated with a poor prognosis [13] . The MAPK signaling pathway is also implicated in pituitary adenomas and because of the important roles of MAPK signaling pathways in tumorigenesis, the use of the MAPK signaling pathways as therapeutic targets has continuously been considered as a promising strategy for pituitary adenoma therapy [14] . In the context of the role of two of the MAPK signaling pathways (ERKs 1/2 and p38), data suggest that MEK-MAPK-ERK signaling has a role in adrenocortical tumorigenesis that could be potentially used as a diagnostic marker for malignancy and targeted treatment in adrenocortical carcinoma [15] . Cholesterol in the form of LDL enhances intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer progression via activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and signaling pathways including the MAPK pathway; [16] and, the estrogen receptor-\u03b1 activates MAPK signaling pathway to promote the development of endometrial cancer [17] . The oncologic sequelae of COVID-19 may include these cancers upon viral activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.

The activation JAK-STAT signaling pathway has shown to be involved in tumorigenesis, including T-cell lymphoma, lung cancer and breast cancer. Gene expression profiling has implicated several intracellular signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT pathway, in the pathogenesis of particular subtypes of lymphoma [18] . JAK-STAT signaling pathways are mutationally activated in many extranodal T-cell lymphomas, such as natural killer/T-cell and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas [19] . Since the JAK-STAT pathway is considered to be a central player in inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis, the implication of JAK-STAT signaling and the therapeutic potential of JAK1/2 inhibition was investigated in K-RAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma, and data showed that JAK1 and JAK2 are activated in human lung adenocarcinoma and that increased activation of JAK-STAT signaling correlated with disease progression and K-RAS activity in human lung adenocarcinoma [20] . Dysregulated JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in breast cancer metastasis, which is associated with high relapse risks, which may be mediated through GRAM1b [21] . NF-\u03baB, and TRIF-dependent pathways are also activated; and, IRF3 and IFN-\u03b2 are activated in turn [12] . Transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB induce the gene expression of type I interferon through their activation by adaptor protein TRIF of TLRs. TLRs classify these types of signaling pathways induced by viral infection: The TLR signaling pathways are classified as the MyD88-dependent pathway, which functions to activate immune inflammatory factors and the TRIF-dependent pathway, which then in turn functions to activate the type I interferons and inflammatory factors [12] . NF-\u03baB-driven gene products include cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, anti-apoptotic factors, angiogenesis regulators and metalloproteinases, and drive oncogenesis. For instance, many of the genes transcribed by NF-\u03baB promote gastric carcinogenesis. Since it has been shown that chemotherapy-caused cellular stress could elicit activation of the survival factor NF-\u03baB, which leads to acquisition of chemoresistance, the NF-\u03baB system is recommended for therapeutic targeting [22] . Prosaposin, a neurotrophic factor, promotes the proliferation and tumorigenesis of glioma through TLR4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathways [23] .",

In the case of HIV-1, DC precursor cells cannot differentiate into DCs if transfected with HIV-1 Nef protein in the presence of the inducers, indicating that Nef blocks the differentiation of DC precursor cells into mature DCs [12] . Additionally, both the core protein and NS3 protein of HCV inhibits the expression of CD1a, CD1b and DC-SIGN molecules on human peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells, which play an important role in the development of peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells to DCs [12] . In addition, HIV-1 attenuates the MHC I on the surface of DCs, thereby reducing the ability of DCs to present the viral antigens. HIV-1 infection enhances the expression of DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrity (DC-SIGN), thus inhibiting CC chemokine receptor 7 and MHC-II, which are important receptors of DC homing [12] . These results indicate that virus infection interferes with the differentiation and function of DCs, hinders the subsequent adaptive immune response mediated by DCs and makes the virus evade the adaptive immune response of the host successfully [6] . If these DC events are occurring, cancer may co-opt normal cellular function and evade immune responses in a viral infection such as COVID-19.",

In cancer, the cancer-immunity cycle is dysfunctional with the accumulation of inhibitors of T-cell response and promoters of cancer cell growth. In SARS-CoV infection, cytotoxic T cells play a significant role and combat the pathogen by killing viral-infected cells and promoting the production of virus-specific antibodies by activating T-dependent B cells. The inflammation observed in the pulmonary environment upon viral infection is due to this large role played by CD8 + T cells which lead to immune injury. Immunosuppression, a risk factor for novel coronavirus, may emerge, conversely, as a risk for cancer in the context of viral infection. From an understanding of the cancer-immunity cycle, are there are any elements of novel coronavirus infection that would make the cycle vulnerable to cancer at any point and prevent the generation of immunity to cancer? The presence of checkpoint inhibitors to immune responses, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein-4, programmed death-1 and programmed death-ligand-1, may inure the development of cancer with viral infection. In a depleted T-cell environment postinfection, the broad T-cell response to cancer may be undermined. This inflammatory response concomitant with immune cell depletion, whether temporary or not, may lead to oncologic sequelae if accompanied by a superimposed mutagenic and/or carcinogenic event potentially occurring in a timeadjacent manner. Figure 6 displays the tumor microenvironment in the context of breast cancer and illustrates major inflammation and cytokine release, marks of viral infection which may predispose to cancer.",

While both of these mechanisms are not implicated in SARS-CoV-2, these are not exclusive mechanisms. The turning on of oncogenic signaling pathways and the acute inflammatory response that results upon coronavirus infection can be hypothesized as being cancer inducing, or leading to the risk of developing cancer, especially if the patient has a superimposed mutagenic or carcinogenic event occurring concomitantly, even if the virus does not cause a chronic infection like viruses such as HCV, HCV and EBV. Additionally, there exist limited resources and research as a result of the pandemic that may damage the prognosis of cancer patients. Novel coronavirus can destroy T cells, but unlike HIV, does not lead to persistent infection of T cells. Data suggest however that there is a general depletion of T cells in the COVID-19 infection environment, and this may affect the healthy progression of the cancer-immunity cycle. Also, there exist gaps in current knowledge on the novel coronavirus' impact on the immune system during co-infection by other viruses, such as HCV, HIV and EBV. Finally, the overwhelming organ dysfunction that novel coronaviruses results in some cases should be further investigated, and as possibly having an association with cancer.

It is the cumulative effect of many distinguishable aspects of coronavirus infection that leads to the increased predisposition to cancer, which then warrants closer follow-up in the future. The organ damage, inflammatory response and signaling pathways activation that occur upon viral infection may sum to significantly increase patients' predisposition to cancer, and this may be compounded by a superimposed mutagenic or carcinogenic event. The oncology field may evolve by investigating the potential tumor microenvironment in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and if the virus can be considered an etiological agent in the development of cancer.
