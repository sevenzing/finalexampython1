Then, quite recently several publications revealed the presence of COVID-19 in urine.Herein, we reported the detection of COVID-19 in urinary samples in 8 studies.COVID-19 is a rapidly emerging pandemic which threatens the security and biosafety at the world level. According to the latest World Health Organization situation report number 107 released on 6 th May, more than 3.5 million people have been infected worldwide leaving more than 240000deaths 27 . Preparedness against such a vast pandemic requires efforts in diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention and treatment. Clinical, laboratory, imaging, and prognostic studies as well as disease outcome analysis builds up the core knowledge necessary for any new disease. Several questions in the context of COVID-19 have been addressed including spectrum of disease severity (asymptomatic to fatal) 28 and the bodily organs or secretions in which the virus in present. ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, and high structural similarity has been demonstrated between cellular binding sites for SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV 29 . Virus usual initial binding site is through ACE2 receptor at ciliated bronchial epithelial cells, and then spread of infection happened to other organs. COVID-19 infection induces a cytokine storm in the body incorporating a cascade of immune responses. ACE2 expression is tissue-specific, and is mainly expressed in the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and gastrointestinal systems. A 1% positivity of ACE2 receptor in cells has been suggested for organ involvement in COVID-19 by Zhou et al. Based on this",

The presence of proteinuria and microscopic hematuria has been associated with greater clinical severity of COVID-19 disease 31 . Combination of previous findings can point toward kidney involvement and urinary alteration in COVID-19 as a result of cytokine storm 12 in comparison with direct invasion of kidney parenchyma by the virus. Han et al. reported a relatively long duration of urinary viral shedding in a neonate. Interestingly, the virus was also detected in saliva from this patient and urinary shedding was observed for 11 days during infection in comparison with 1-2 days of viral shedding in adult patients suggesting a higher potential for infection transmission in case of neonatal infection.

This observation challenges the results of several studies that have reported negative urinary rRT-PCR based on readings below or marginally above test cut off 22 and suggests the possibility that the real frequency of COVID-19 in urine could be higher than reports based on diagnostic cut off of conventional real time RT-PCR assays. The timeline for positivity of urinary samples in not consistent between reports. While Xu and colleagues reported urine positivity on day 7 after onset of symptoms and clearance of virus in urinary sample on the 10 th day 32 , Ling et al. reported the persistence of COVID-19 in urinary samples of 3 patients after clearance of virus in their nasopharyngeal samples 17 . Collectively, COVID-19 was reported in 3.7 percent of urinary samples from 430 patients. The highest frequency of infected urinary samples (in studies with more than 3 patients) belongs to the report of Peng et al. and Lu et al. from Guangdong, and Guangzhou who reported one infected urinary sample within urinary samples of 9 patients (11%). This rate is greatly lower in comparison with urinary infection rates of up to 42% which were previously reported for SARS-CoV 33 . One of the possible reasons for the low detection rate of COVID-19 can be short duration of virus presence in urine. Kim et al. investigated urinary samples from two Korean patients. They evaluated urinary samples from day 3 through day 14 of the illness. The PCR for RdRp was marginally positive only on day 12 and for gene E was again marginally positive only on day 9.

This review investigated the presence of COVID-19 in urine of infected patients or evaluated its pathogenic effects in cell cultures. The clinical significance low urinary viral load of patients and the potential of urine to be a source of infection transmission remains to be further investigated. The significance of the findings of the current systematic review relies on the reported low overall positive rate of COVID-19 infection in patients' urinary samples which has been confirmed in several studies. We think that medical intervention like urethral catheter insertion and urinary endoscopic operations should be performed with caution considering the possibility of urine infection and possibility of COVID-19 transmission through this route. CONCLUSIONS We performed a systematic review of literature on the presence of COVID-19 in urine of infected patients. The results of this review revealed an average positivity rate of 3.7% for COVID-19 in patients' urine samples. The quantity of virus in most reports were lower than rectal or oropharyngeal samples. Nevertheless, we emphasize the low rate of urinary infection in COVID-19 and propose regular cautions in dealing with urinary samples in patients with COVID-19 infection and when performing medical interventions including urethral catheter passage and endoscopy in patients with COVID-19.",
