Whilst the majority of effort is aimed at infection, there is also need for clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19 [1] . Current available therapies -including non-specific anti-virals, antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections and sepsis, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation -fail in severe disease where the hallmark is the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 in the lung, visible as inflammatory lesions with groundglass opacity on CT scan. Virally-triggered acute cytokine release of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\u03b1 induces pulmonary oedema, dysfunction of air-exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and often secondary infection, leading to death.",

Using nanotechnology synthetic stem cells are available as \"LIFNano\" with 1000 times increase in potency compared to soluble LIF [7] .

Previous studies using neural stem cells (NSC) to treat EAE showed benefits that were solely dependent on NSC-derived LIF [reviewed in 7].

The anti-LIF resulted in LIF being undetectable, whilst the other cytokines measured -GCSF, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, KC, MIP-2 -were not significantly altered by the anti-LIF treatment.

LIFNano synthetic stem cell therapy EAE rapid reversal of paralysis SIGNIFICANCE -rapid recovery of motor function correlates with kinetics of myelin repair -LIFNano-CD4 crosses the Blood-Brain Barrier -Mice remain fully immune competent Paralysis in an EAE model is rapidly reversed by LIFNano therapy. C57/Bl10 mice were immunised against myelin protein (MOG) resulting in paralysis of hind limbs and tail by day 14: protocol was the Hooke model of experimental allergic encephalopathy -this provides a standardised preclinical animal model of Multiple Sclerosis. Untreated: Mice 15 days post immunisation showing paralysis of hind limbs and tail. Treated: Mice treated identically and showing paralysis at 15d, then followed by 4 days treatment with 1 mg/day i.p. LIFNano-CD4 nanoparticles.",
