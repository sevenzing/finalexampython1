Adopting correct indicators to monitor the lethality of the infection in the course of the outbreak is a crucial issue. This works highlights how far the case fatality ratio, as calculated day by day in the course of the outbreak, is a misleading indicator for estimating the fatality rate, even if our attention is only restricted to the subset of confirmed cases. We prove that the final case fatality ratio for several major European countries is bound to largely exceed 10%. The difference in the case fatality ratio values between Italy and other major European countries considered in this work (except for the case of Germany), often interpreted in terms of peculiarities of the Italian population or health system, is to be mostly attributed to the more advanced stage of the Italian epidemic.",

Monitoring Covid-19 lethality and its variation from country to country is essential for supporting governments in selecting the appropriate decisions. The adoption of correct indicators to monitor the lethality of the infection in the course of the outbreak is therefore a crucial issue. 2, 3 The following terms are used in this work: the infection fatality ratio, IFR, indicates the ratio between the total deaths and total infected patients within a given population; the final case fatality ratio, CFR itself in the course of an outbreak, as better clarified in the following, is a tricky and non-trivial operation. Large and efficient testing programs allow accounting for non-symptomatic patients, thus increasing ccc(t).",
