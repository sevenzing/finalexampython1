This type of consensus work is precisely how and why the We believe that multidisciplinary PERTs are invaluable in the care of patients with suspected 1 or proven venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with severe pneumonic COVID-19.",

There is clearly a balance that must be achieved between an 6 acceptable diagnostic yield and unnecessary testing as well as a balance between offering an 7 acceptable, effective therapy that again, minimizes exposure and carefully utilizes resources. in areas in which they are not used to working. 23 We understand that the current paradigm proposed by the authors emphasizes preventing 1 VTE related morbidity and mortality -often with empiric anticoagulation at the expense of 2 potential bleeding complications while imaging is delayed. 6 Difficult decisions need to be made, 3 and patients should be individualized as we wait for carefully conducted randomized trials. There 4 may not be one answer for all. We believe PERTs can play a key role here. While we must \"first, 5 do no harm\" and not take the bleeding risks of full-dose anticoagulation lightly, the practical 6 approach offered in the document by Obi and colleagues, is well-thought out, savvy, and 7 importantly, multidisciplinary. We believe that such an approach together with the 8 multidisciplinary PERT concept, can further enhance the care of patients. ",

Gestalt has proven useful in the diagnosis of acute PE -witness 13 the interesting ROC curve published by Pe\u00f1aloza and colleagues; gestalt and consensus with 14 experts is critical in these complex times. 6 The markedly elevated D-dimer levels we see together 15 with severely elevated inflammatory markers may arouse suspicion of PE, but may not be. 16 Insightful decision-making and clear communication are required, and PERTs are well-equipped 17 to aid in these decisions. 18 A key aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic is the assignment of clinicians with various skill 19 sets to care for COVID patients. A pediatric neurologist, for example might be working in an 20 adult medical ICU. A general surgeon may be rounding on a general medical ward.
