It is assumed that COVID-19 has zoonotic origin based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet market in Wuhan City, China. The phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has significant sequence similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like (SARS-like) bat viruses, thus bats could be primary possible reservoir. The intermediate host and there subsequent transfer is not known yet, although human to human transfer is widely confirmed. The transmission of COVID-19 infection from one person to another resulted in the isolation of patients who were subsequently given a variety of treatments. To monitor the current outbreak, robust steps have been taken around the globe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 infection particularly banning international and domestic flights, inducting lockdowns in vulnerable areas, social distancing etc. No clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine against COVID-19 is reported yet. However, in clinical trials, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs were evaluated against COVID-19 infection which resulted in clinical recovery.

Earlier coronaviral outbreaks (CoVs) include Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV which have significantly caused great threat to human beings. In December 2019, a number of patients were admitted to hospitals with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia. These patients were found to have epidemiological links with wet animal and seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1, 2] . Early studies predicted the onset of a possible coronavirus outbreak. The WHO on 11th February 2020 estimated the reproduction number for COVID-19 significantly largely ranging between 2.24 to 3.58 [3] . In December 2019 the first cases for COVID-19 infections were reported [4] . From 18th December, 2029 to 29th December 2019, 5 patients having acute respiratory distress syndrome were hospitalized among which one patient died [5] . Upto 2 January 2020, 41 patients were identified to possess laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. Almost half of these patients had underlying diseases particularly cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes [6] . It was believed that these patients were infected in hospital possibly due to nosocomial infection. Thus it was concluded COVID-19 is not a super-hot spreading virus (spread to many others from one patient) but it most likely spread as many patients get infected by unknown mechanisms at different locations in the hospital. Furthermore only those patients were tested that were clinically sick and probably there were several more patients who were infected. As of January 22, 2020 a total of 571 COVID-19 infection cases were reported in 25 provinces of China [7] . Upto 22 January 2020 China National Health Commission reported the details of first 17 deaths. On 25th January 2020 a total of 1975 COVID-19 infection cases were confirmed along with 56 deaths in mainland China [8] . Another report of 24th January 2020, estimated 5502 COVID-19 infections in China [9, 10] . The first COVID-19 infection case was reported on 10th January 2020 which was led by identification, description, clinical diagnosis and management of the case. It included initial mild symptoms of the patient which leaded to pneumonia on 9th day of illness [11] . Moreover on 30 January 2020 first case of COVID-19 humanto-human transmission was reported in US (https://www.cdc. gov/media/releases/2020/p0130).

[8] reported that time period between onset of COVID-19 symptoms to death ranges between 6-41 days with a 14-day median. This time period depends on patient's immune system and age of the patient. It is found shorter among patients of more than 70 years of age relative to those below 70 years patients [8] . The common symptoms at the onset of infection are fatigue, cough and fever while as other symptoms include lymphopenia, haemoptysis, headache, sputum production and diarrhea [13] . The chest CT scan reveals pneumonia nevertheless there are some other clinical features like acute cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia and incidence of grand-glass opacities that leads to death [6] . In certain cases, several peripheral ground-glass opacities have been identified in subpleural regions of both lungs which likely induce both localized and systemic immune response leading to increased inflammation [14] . Unfortunately interferon inhalation therapy showed no therapeutic benefit but instead aggravated the disorder by worsening pulmonary opacity [14] .",

More importantly, COVID-19 showed unique clinical features like targeting the lower airway as is evident by symptoms like sore throat, rhinorrhoea and sneezing [15, 16] . Additionally, on the basis of chest radiographs results some cases were found to possess infiltrate in the upper lobe of the lung associated with increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia [17] . Although COVID-19-infected patients reported gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhoea, a small percentage of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV patients experienced similar GI distress. Hence, analyzing faecal and urine samples is necessary to eliminate a possible alternative route of transmission, specifically by health care staff, patients, etc. [15, 16] . Therefore, development of methods for identifying the different modes of transmission such as feacal and urine samples is urgently needed to establish strategies for inhibiting and/or reducing transmission and developing therapeutics to manage the disease.",

It has been observed that early detected cases had some kind of history of interaction with the seafood market [19] . Eventually human-to-human transmission by close contact was found as secondary cause of COVID-19 infection. There has been rise in the frequency of infected individuals with no history of wildlife exposure or visiting Wuhan and several cases of infection have been identified among medical professionals as well [20] . It has become apparent that COVID-19 infection occurs upon exposure to virus and both normal and immunosuppressed population seem susceptible. Most of adult patients were between 35 -55 years of age with fewer cases found among children and infants [19, 21] . A research on the dynamics of early transmission of the virus reported that the median age of patients was 59 years ranging from 15 -89 years with the majority being males (59%) [12] . People with low immune function particularly old aged people and those with renal and hepatic dysfunction were considered to be high risk group [12] .",

Besides, SARS-CoV-2 there are six other coronaviruses reported in humans. These are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV and HCoVNL63 [25, 26] . Over the last two decades Coronavirus has caused two major pandemics: SARS [27] and MERS [28] . In order to find out the source of the COVID-19 outbreak CDC researchers of China collected 585 environmental samples from Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, Hubei Province. They found 33 samples were SARS-CoV-2 suggested that it came from wild animals sold on the market [29] . Researchers also used the 'lung fluid, blood, and throat swab samples from 15 patients for laboratory Elderly people [8] People with poor immune function People with chronic co-morbidities [8] Surgery history before admission [8] research. Such laboratory studies revealed that virus-specific nucleic acid sequences in the sample vary from those of known human coronavirus species. The laboratory findings also showed SARS CoV-2 is identical to some of the beta (\u03b2) coronaviruses genera found in bats which is located in the SARS/SARS-like CoV groups [30] . For the conduction of nextgeneration sequencing from cultured isolates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid nine inpatients were enrolled by researchers in Wuhan with viral pneumonia and without any common respiratory pathogens. The results indicated SARS-CoV-2 was more distinct from MERS-CoV (with approximately 50% sequence identity) and SARS-CoV (with approximately 79% sequence identity) than from two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (with 87.2% sequence identity) and bat-SL-CoVZC45 (with 87.9% sequence identity) [31] . The studies also showed that COVID-19 S-protein strongly interacted with human ACE2 molecules in spite of dissimilarity of its sequence with that of SARS-CoV [32, 33] . The case fatality rate (CFR) of any disease is not fixed it varies with location and with time. It is reported that CFR of COVID-19 varies widely between countries ranging from 0.2 % in Germany to 7.7 % in Italy. It may not be accurate comparison of the true likelihood particularly like that of COVID-19. Since, we are not aware weather the same criterion of testing is applied between the countries or many cases are symptomatic vs asymptomatic. So for better decision making and to understand differences in CFR we need better data. However, if we are careful to acknowledge its limitations CFR can help us to understand pandemic better and what should be done to combat it.The countries having small number of confirmed cases till now are left as CFR at small sample size is not significant. As we look towards the trajectory in case of Iran on 24th of February 2020 it had 2 confirmed cases and 2 deaths an implausible CFR of 100%. As the number of cases increased into hundreds over time, its CFR dropped to the level seen in other countries. The CFR of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is represented in Fig. 2 .",

Efforts were made to look for a host reservoir or intermediate carriers from which the infection could spread to humans [10] . The two snake species were identified which were thought the possible COVID-19 reservoirs. However, there is no clear cut evidence for the reservoirs of coronavirus other than mammals and birds till date. The COVID-19 genomic sequence analysis showed its 88 % identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses suggesting that bats are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans [34] . Several studies have indicated that transmission from person to person is a possible way for COVID-19 infection to spread. As it was observed COVID-19 infection occurred in many people who did not even visited Wuhan's wet animal market [13] . Transmission of disease from person to person occurs mainly through direct contact or by droplets released by an infected person through coughing or sneezing. The Fig. 3 how quickly the disease has spread in each country since the 100th confirmed case. A study was conducted on COVID-19 infected women having third trimester and no evidence was analyze which can confirm that transmission can occur from mother to child. Nevertheless pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains uncertain if transmission can occur during vaginal delivery. This study is important as pregnant women's are comparatively more vulnerable to respiratory infections and extreme pneumonia [34] . The first step of COVID-19 viral infection is the binding of the receptor expressed by host cells followed by fusion with the cell membrane. The lung epithelial cells are the primary target of the virus. It has been stated that human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV occurs through binding between cellular receptor known as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and receptor-binding domain of virus spikes [34] . It is important to mention here that receptor binding domain sequence of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV. These results indicate that the most likely entry into the host cells is through the ACE2 receptor [35] .",

The COVID19 genetic sequence showed more than 50 % identity to MERS-CoV and 80% to SARS-CoV [37] and both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV originate in bats [38] . COVID-19 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans and has been categorized under the subfamily orthocoronavirinae. It was a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus [23] . On the basis phylogenetic reports and genetic sequence studies COVID-19 varies significantly from SARS-CoV and can thus be regarded as a new betacoronavirus that infects humans. The COVID-19 most likely developed from bat origin coronaviruses. The another evidence which supports that COVID-19 is of bat origin is the high of homology ACE2 receptor from a diversity of animal species there by implicating these animal species are possible intermediate hosts or animal models for COVID-19 infections [35] . Additionally these viruses have single intact open reading frame on gene 8 which is another sign of batorigin CoVs.

The patients with mild symptoms usually recover within a week while as severe cases have been reported to suffer from progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage which can lead to death as well [18]. Usually elderly patients and middle aged patients with some pre-existing diseases (coronary heart disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, hypertension, tumor surgery and cirrhosis) were seen to more prone to death [38] . The case definition guidelines mentioned the following symptoms: decrease in lymphocytes and white blood cells, fever and new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography with no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotic treatment [38] . In patients with suspected infection, the following techniques for diagnosis have been suggested: conducting real-time fluorescence (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 positive nucleic acid in sputum, throat swabs, and lower respiratory tract sample secretions [39] .",

Under this policy medical institutes can adopt observation protocols and isolation treatment to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19. In China the National Health Commission issued national guidelines on the prevention and control of COVID-19 infection on 22 January 2020 for medical institutes to prevent nosocomial infection [65] . On 28 January 2020, during the Chinese Spring Festival the National Health Commission released guidelines for rapid prevention and control measures to effectively contain the spread of the disease through a \"major isolation and great disinfection\" program [66] . Nationallevel policies with targeted measures for elderly population (published on 31 January 2020) and for rural areas (released on 28 January 2020) were also released [67] . Several public health interventions have been implemented that can avoid or delay the COVID-19 transmission; these include case isolation, identification and surveillance of contacts, environmental disinfection, and the use of personal protective equipments [68] . As of now no specific antiviral therapy has been confirmed COVID-19 infection. With regard to patients diagnosed with COVID-19, it was recommended that appropriate symptomatic treatment and supportive care be applied [6] . The studies have also reported the prevention of psychological health issues and nosocomial infection associated with COVID. A series of measures have been suggested to minimize nosocomial infection, including awareness training for prevention and control, isolation, disinfection, protection at different levels in infection areas and protection of reported cases [68] . With respect to psychological health, some suggested psychological interventions are set up for medical staff, suspected cases and confirmed cases [69] .",

Previously, various animal models were used for examining replication of SARS-CoV which showed the symptoms of severe infection [73] . In case MERS-CoV no pathogenesis was observed in small animals as against seen in case of SARS-CoV. Mice was found not susceptible to MERS-coronavirus infection because of noncompatibility of the DPP 4 receptor [74] . As the entire genome of COVID-19 is more than 80% similar previous human SARSlike bat CoV, hence animal models previously used for SARS-CoV may be useful to study the pathogenicity of COVID-19. Novel coronaviruses and SARS both recognize human ACE 2 cell receptor. Conclusively TALEN or CRISPR-mediated genetically modified hamsters or other small animals may be used to test the pathogenicity of novel coronaviruses. It was observed that SARS-CoV having a mutation for spike glycoprotein, replicate and cause severe disease in Rats (F344) [75] . Thus spike glycoprotein targeting therapeutics is a suitable option against coronaviruses. In recent studies to formulate some therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 clinical isolates and mice models were used [45] . Artificial intelligence prediction were also used in similar studies to investigate the inhibitory role of the drug against SARS-CoV-2 [44] . Randomized clinical trials were also used in COVID-19 patients [11] . It is now essential for scientists worldwide to collaborate on the design of an effective model and to investigate the in vivo mechanisms associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

Special attention and efforts should be applied for protecting or reducing transmission in vulnerable populations, including infants, health care providers and the elderly. For medical personnel, health care professionals, public health individuals and researchers involved in the 2019-nCoV guidelines to follow are published [76] . The early death cases in COVID-19 outbreak occurred mainly in the elderly possibly due to a poor immune system that allows for more rapid progression of viral infection [12] . The decontaminating regents should be provided by public services and facilities regularly. The physical contact with contaminated things particularly urine and facecal samples should be considered in dealing with the virus as these can potentially serve as an alternative route of transmission [15] . Most of the countries around the world particularly US, China, India, UAE etc have implemented major control and prevention measures like implementing state wise or country wise lockdown and travel screenings so as to control virus spread. The epidemiological changes occurring in COVID-19 infection should be monitored carefully taking into account potential transmission routes and subclinical infections, as well as the adaptation, evolution, possible intermediate animals and reservoir and spread of virus among humans. A large number of issues still remain to be addressed. Some of which are who and how many were tested, what percentage of these came out positive, weather this rate remains constant or it varies. What proposition of people tested positive for COVID-19 but showed clinical symptoms. So far only few paediatric cases were reported, it is because real lack of susceptibility or due to inadequate testing.",
