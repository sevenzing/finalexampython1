Methods: We included consecutive hospitalized elderly individuals suspected of having pneumonia. At inclusion, NPS were collected from all participants and tested by PCR for the presence of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens (index test, defined as comprehensive molecular testing). Routine diagnostic tests (blood and sputum culture, urine antigen detection) were also performed. The reference standard was the presence of pneumonia on a low-dose CT scan as assessed by two independent expert radiologists. Results: The diagnosis of pneumonia was confirmed in 127 of 199 (64%) included patients (mean age 83 years, community-acquired pneumonia in 105 (83%)). A pathogen was identified by comprehensive molecular testing in 114 patients (57%) and by routine methods in 22 (11%). Comprehensive molecular testing was positive for viruses in 62 patients (31%) and for bacteria in 73 (37%). The sensitivity and specificity were 61% (95% CI 53%e69%) and 50% (95% CI 39%e61%) for comprehensive molecular testing, and 14% (95% CI 82%e21%) and 94% (95% CI 86%e98%) for routine testing, respectively. Positive likelihood ratio was 2.55 for routine methods and 1.23 for comprehensive molecular testing.

Certainly, many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus, are known causes of pneumonia [16e21]. Jain et al. showed that respiratory viruses were more frequently detected than bacteria in patients hospitalized for non-severe CAP (median age 57 years) [22] .
