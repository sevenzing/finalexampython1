SARS-CoV-2 carriage was assessed by quantitative PCR. Overall, 49 (7.0%) people were positive for SARS-CoV-2, including 37 homeless individuals (of 411, 9.0%), 12 employees (of 152, 7.9%). SARS-CoV-2 positivity correlated with symptoms, although 51% of positive patients did not report respiratory symptoms or fever. Among homeless people, being young (18-34 years) (OR: 3.83 [1.47-10.0], p=0.006) and being housed in one specific shelter (OR: 9.13 [4.09-20.37], p<0.0001) were independent factors associated with the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates (11.4% and 20.6%, respectively).

Homeless people are a vulnerable group who may potentially be exposed to this infection and have potentially more severe outcomes than in the general population, due to their poor living conditions, the higher prevalence of comorbidity, and mental and physical conditions impaired by substance or alcohol abuse (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Crowded conditions in shelters without specific preventive measures could facilitate viral transmission (7, 8) . In several U.S. cities, 1,192 residents and 313 staff members were tested in 19 homeless shelters in March-April and high rates of SARS-CoV-2 carriage were observed in residents (25%) and staff members (11%) (9, 10); the prevalence was also reported to be 9.7-15.5% and 13.3%-14.8% among residents and staff members in within 3 homeless shelters in Washington, respectively (11). This raised concerns that the virus may be widely transmitted within homeless shelters, even when infection control vigilance is high.",

We observed a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (12) and high carriage rates of both respiratory viruses (13) and bacteria (14), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection might also be frequent in this population. Based on the preliminary information that some homeless persons from these two shelters presented with COVID-19 symptoms, we organised a screening campaign in collaboration with the staff in charge of these shelters. We subsequently received other requests for screening from several accommodation centres specialising in housing vulnerable people. In this study, we present the results of SARS-CoV-2 screening campaigns conducted among sheltered homeless individuals, in comparison with asylum-seekers, other persons living in precarious conditions, and employees working in the accommodation centres. We also investigated the role of potential risk factors for virus carriage among the homeless population.",

This may have resulted from the higher number of individuals per room at this shelter, as compared to other shelters, which may have encouraged transmission of the virus. Sleeping in shared dormitories and using shared bathrooms, toilets and kitchens make the implementation of social distancing measures in the context of homeless shelters particularly challenging. Being young (18-34 years) was an independent factor associated with SARS-CoV-2 detection in the homeless group, which may be due to a higher propensity of younger homeless people to develop social interactions within the shelters and hotels as compared to older people aged \u2265 50 years. This work has some limitations. Our study population was not randomly and homogenously recruited. Participants' medical histories and use of individual preventive measures were not documented. Individuals were not asked about anosmia and ageusia. Notwithstanding these limitations, our data provide a novel insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 among different vulnerable urban populations. The survey also reveals the role of collective housing in relation to viral transmission within accommodation centres. Further genomic investigations are needed to better assess the source(s) and mode(s) of transmission of COVID-19 in this context.",
