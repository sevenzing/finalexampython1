The reported frequency of symptomatic viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) varies between 3 and 8%, with a significantly lower frequency seen following autologous compared with allo-HSCT. 1, 2 This is likely to be an underestimate, as the incidence of respiratory virus infection diagnosed using new multiplex PCR techniques in one prospective study was 25%. However, this included both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. 3 The most frequently implicated viral pathogens are respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs). 1, 2 Parainfluenza viruses are well-recognised respiratory pathogens in children in whom infection is usually mild, ranging from the characteristic laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) to upper RTI (URTI), bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The lower respiratory tract typically is involved in only 15% of cases. 4 In the immunocompromised host, however, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In one study, 86% of HSCT recipients with lower respiratory tract viral infection had severe airflow decline at 1 year after infection, although numbers were small. 5 This complication is associated with increased mortality risk and appears more frequent after PIV, lower RTI in particular.",

Following an outbreak of PIV-3 infection in the Stem Cell  Transplant Unit at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust, a  retrospective review of all HSCT patients diagnosed with  PIV-3 between April and November 2008 was undertaken. Laboratory records were cross-referenced to ensure all cases of infection were included. Inclusion criteria were HSCT within 12 months of diagnosis (24 months in the presence of GVHD and/or continuing immunosuppressive therapy) and PIV-3 infection diagnosed by DIF assay on respiratory samples. Local policy was to actively screen for symptoms of infection. Respiratory samples were tested on any patient presenting to the ward or clinic in whom upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms were volunteered or detected.",

In addition, bacterial infection may be promoted by increased expression of bacterial receptors on PIV-3-infected cells. 15 The presence of pulmonary co-pathogens and the need for mechanical 23 and 24% in two retrospective series obtained from the USA. 2, 8 Two reports of small PIV-3 outbreaks in English HSCT populations found the frequency of LRTI to range from 25 to 52%, although in contrast to the outcome in our cohort, this was not associated with an increase in overall mortality. 11, 16 At the time of this outbreak, our standard screen for detection of respiratory viruses was by DIF on NPA samples. Owing to the poor tolerability of this test procedure, patients were screened for clinical features of respiratory infection and samples collected only from those with symptoms. Although it has been postulated that active surveillance and early treatment could account for low mortality, 17 we saw a highmortality rate, despite an active screening policy in symptomatic patients. In the case of our series, it is likely that the underlying immune deficiency, assessed by total lymphocyte count, presence or absence of GVHD and use of high-dose steroids allowed the development of secondary infections, which were often fatal despite appropriate anti-microbial therapy.",
