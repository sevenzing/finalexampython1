In regions where hygienic and nutritional standards are low and access to modern health care is poor, annual deaths are measured in millions (Rohde and Northrup, 1976) . Within societies considered to be \"developed\", infant mortality from diarrhoea1 disease is much less but the problem remains a major cause of illness and a significant cause of death Carlson etal., 1978) . The recognition of the importance of clean, properly constituted infant diets and the identification of the special needs of the young for water and electrolytes were important milestones in the emergence of modern pediatrics. The dissemination of these principles undoubtedly greatly diminished the occurrence, and severity of infectious diarrhoea among infants and children in developed countries in the first half of the century. In the past decade further advances have been made in our understanding of the causes and mechanisms of infectious diarrhoea, exciting advances that promise to have a significant impact on both morbidity and mortality from enteric infection among children everywhere.",

Serotyping may be of value in tracing an epidemic of diarrhoea and a recent study has shown an increased incidence of recognized pathogenic strains among patients with diarrhoea compared with controls (Gurwith et a/., 1978) . However, since the capsular antigen appears to bear little relationship to the characteristics that are recognized currently as factors in the pathogenesis of diarrhoea, serotyping is unlikely to be of much help in assessing sporadic cases. Strains of E. coli can cause intestinal injury by invading the mucosa or, more commonly, by elaborating enterotoxins which may be heat labile (LH) or heat stable (SH). Enterotoxin producing and invasive strains of E. coli have caused sporadic cases of diarrhoea in infants and children, but their incidence appears to be relatively low. Recent research has caused us to revise our thinking about this bacterium, but unfortunately it has not yet provided us with practical diagnostic methodology. Laboratory techniques are available for the bioassay of LH and SH enterotoxinity and invasiveness, but they are crude, cumbersome and therefore not yet suitable for routine diagnostic laboratories.",

The infection is seen in patients of all ages but the young seem particularly susceptible. Among children the peak incidence is between one and five years. The typical clinical syndrome caused by Yersinia enterocolitica in an infant or young child is characterized by fever and acute, self-limited, watery diarrhoea resolving in three to four days. In older children abdominal pain is very common. The pain, crampy, located in the right lower quadrant or mid abdomen, may persist for days or weeks with chronic diarrhoea. Early in the illness such patients are suspected of having acute appendicitis and if the illness persists the picture mimics that of nonspecific inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease. B a r i u m s t u d i e s m a y d e m o n s t r a t e i l e a l abnormalities similar to those seen in Crohn's disease but they are superficial and short-lived.

Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is an acute coronavirus infection that can be consistently induced in experimental conditions in two to three week old pigs. Although caused by a different agent, the disease is very similar to human rotavirus enteritis in that it is confined to the epithelium of the small bowel. In TGE the defect in the intestinal transport of sodium and chloride differs from that seen in cholera. Glucose stimulated sodium transport is defective and activity of the Na+-K+-ATPase system, located in the lateral epithelial membrane, is supressed. Although perfusion studies suggested a secretion of sodium and chloride into the upper intestinal lumen, no stimulus of adenyl cyclase nor accumulation of cyclic AMP can be demonstrated. The infection involves the proximal portion of the small intestine and extends for a variable extent distally. Our recent studies indicate that ileal involvement is likely to be an important determinant of the severity of the diarrhoea occurring in cholera; sodium concentrations in stools are 50-80 mEqllitre rather than 120 mEqllitre. Although significant increases of faecal sugar concentrations are rarely seen even in acute disease, mucosal disaccharidase activities are diminished and our preliminary studies demonstrate a suppression of intestinal transport of glucose as expected.",

Diarrhoea occurs at a time when the intestinal villi are covered, not with infected cells, but with cells that have failed to differentiate and mature as they migrated up from the crypts to replace the shed cells. Studies of undifferentiated enterocytes, isolated selectively from normal crypts, have shown transport characteristics similar to those occurring in cells isolated from villi after viral infection (Gall eta/., 1977) .",

We have recently shown abnormalities in ion transport and defective mucosal epithelial differentiation in piglets infected with HRV identical to those occurring in TGE infected animals (Davidson et a/., 1977) . This form of infectious diarrhoea caused by an invasive agent clearly differing from that caused by enterotoxin, appears not to be a direct response to viral damage. Diarrhoea is associated with a defect in the normal differentiation of the small bowel enterocyte. One can be confident in applying the general interpretations from the TGE model to the human disease. It remains to be seen whether other invasive enteritides, viral, bacterial or parasitic, distort transport and epithelial differentiation in a similar fashion. Undoubtedly, the region of intestine involved and the extent to which the full thickness of the bowel wall is involved will be among the factors determining the pathophysiological response.",

The recognition of a major viral pathogen affecting infants, human rotavirus, raises the possibility of a vaccine but the reality of such a vaccine, should it prove feasible, is several important steps away, since the virus cannot yet be reliably sustained in tissue culture. The production and use of a cholera toxoid is currently under investigation in several centres but it is not yet available. In the meantime, perhaps some less sophisticated alternative preventative measures are at our disposal. Although its specific action on different pathogenic organisms has not been studied in detail, breast feeding has been shown to have a beneficial effect on morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea. More work is needed to substantiate these observations in relation to specific enteritides, but studies from Costa Rica have recently shown antibody to human rotavirus in human colostrum.8 Even now, there appears to be sufficient evidence to advocate breast feeding, particularly in communities where attack rates for infantile enteritis are high. Two additional opportunities to improve preventative measures have become apparent. Electron microscopic studies have shown that spread of viral enteritides in institutions, particularly children's hospitals, is extremely high, a problem that will become more obvious as diagnostic techniques become available more widely. The situation is clearly worthy of aggressive attempts to isolate cases and to enforce scrupulous hygiene for attending personnel, particularly doctors. Other possible sources of bacterial infection, including household pets and dietary poultry, have recently become apparent. Awareness of these potential sources may help in preventing the spread of a particular infection.",

Capitalizing on the preservation of glucose stimulated sodium absorption, workers have used oral glucose-electrolyte solutions to substantially improve the outlook for the patient with cholera (Rohde and Northrup, 1976) . The same approach, using a mixture now provided by WHO, has been used to good effect in treating infants and young children with apparent acute enteritis in whom no specific microbiological diagnosis was made (Hirschhorn, 1977) . Since, in many infants, invasive viral e n t e r i t i s s e e m s m u c h m o r e c o m m o n than an enterotoxigenic infection, further work is needed to determine whether the presently available oral glucoseelectrolyte solution, designed primarily for cholera is optimal for other infectious diarrhoeas of infancy and childhood. The observed relationship between defective differentiation of the epithelium and the development of viral diarrhoea raises the possibility of an important role for adequate nutrient intake in the convalescent phase of this invasive enteritis. Available data may not permit dogma concerning fluid and nutritional therapy for infectious diarrhoea but one can state with confidence that available drugs are of little use in active therapy. Antibiotics have no place in treating viral enteritis and are of little use in bacterial enteritis except when there is concern about systemic infection or in the occasional case of a persisting infection. Anti-peristaltic drugs do not help acute infectious diarrhoea since it is not motility but transport that is impaired in these diseases.",

From a gastroenterologists perspective, admittedly biased, a less obvious avenue for future research based on these studies suggests itself. From our investigations of acute viral enteritis it has become apparent that the migration and differentiation of the small intestinal epithelium are important determinants of the function of that crucial and complex organ. We suspect that an understanding of the obscure factors that control these phenomena holds a key to an understanding of many important intestinal disorders.",
