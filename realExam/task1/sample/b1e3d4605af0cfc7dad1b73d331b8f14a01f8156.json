Moreover proinflammatory cytokines genes such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and chemokines such as CXCL1 and CCL20, were found to be overexpressed in SARS CoV infection by microarray datasets analysis. 9 The importance of the role of massive release of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) is underlined by the fact that there is a significant difference in the concentration of serum of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TGF\u03b2 and of chemokines such as CCL2, CXCL10, CXCL9, and IL-8 between severe disease SARS patients compared to uncomplicated SARS patients. 8 Lethality in SARS was directly correlated with the serum concentration of IFN \u03b1 and \u03b3 and with up regulation of IFN-stimulated genes such as CXCL10 and CCL2. Furthermore, patients with severe disease had low levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. 10 Both in SARS and MERS it seems that the severity of the disease depends from viral load in the airways, age and comorbid condition.",

Literature is very consistent in reporting that elderly male patients, with comorbidities were more prone to develop more severe disease. The most frequent comorbidities present in 30% to 80% of critically ill patients are: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension and malignancy. 14,22,23 A very large study of 72 314 patients from China confirmed that the majority of cases and the higher mortality (14,8%) were among elderly people. The same study showed that the fatality rate among those without comorbidities was 0,9% while in those with cardiovascular disease it was 10,5%, and 7,3% in those with diabetes, 6,3% in those with chronic respiratory diseases, 6% for those with hypertension, and 5,6% for those with cancer. 24 Some author wisely acknowledge that patient characteristics may change in different population affected, however an early analysis of the difference between Italian and Chinese cases concluded that the most at risk patients for severe disease were very similar. 25 More recent Italian data confirm that 84% of deceased patients were 70 years of older and that more than 50% had three or more comorbidities the most frequent of which were: hypertension, ischemic heart disease and diabetes. 26 The only relevant publication reporting immunosuppression and potentially lethal SARS CoV-2 illness was the one regarding the very limited Washington state outbreak in which other comorbidities associated with the 21 patients admitted to ICU were: history of organ transplant (9,5%), immunosuppression (14,3%), and rheumatologic disease (4,8%). 27 Case reports and large patients series, however, mitigate the fear about the potential high risk for immunosuppressed patients. At the best of our knowledge two papers address the issue. 28, 29 The first is a large case series coming from a city in the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy. It describes the cases recorded in a very big pediatric liver transplant population. Only three patients tested positive and no patient among over 200 liver transplanted, 100 with autoimmune liver disease and 300 under chemotherapy for liver cancer developed serious illness due to COVID-19. 28 The second is a case report from Wuhan, reportedly one of the cities with the largest number of kidney transplant in China, it describes the case of an adult kidney transplant patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. This patient recovered after immunosuppressive treatment reduction and introduction of intravenous immunoglobulins and low dose steroids. Noteworthy is the evidence that also this patient had high plasma levels of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 and that his disease course was similar to nonimmunosuppressed patients. 29 3 | CONCLUSION 3.1 | Should we fear for our psoriasis patients treated with biologicals?",
