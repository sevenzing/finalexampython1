The viruses were isolated using a cross-neutralization test and limiting dilution in embryonated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs. Isolate LDL/150434-I was a re-isolation of H120 vaccine strain that was introduced into the chicken flock by vaccination, transmitted between chickens, and later accumulated several genomic mutations. Isolate LDL/150434-II was a novel variant that originated from recombination events between H120 and ck/CH/LDT3/03-like viruses. The widespread use of H120 vaccine, which offered incomplete protection against heterotypic IBVs in the fields, may play important roles in the emergence of such a novel genetic variant. Based on the analysis of S1 and complete genomic sequence, isolate LDL/150434-III was related genetically but distinct from the established strains of nrTW I type viruses of GI-7 lineage circulating in Mainland China since 2009. The three IBV isolates were avirulent when they infected SPF chickens. Furthermore, synergistic effects on pathogenicity were not observed when the different types co-infected the SPF chickens.

The protease initiates the cleavage in trans of the 15 peptides (nonstructural proteins) contained in the polymerase. These peptides, probably together with some cellular proteins, form the replication-transcription complex, and initiate transcription of a series of five nested subgenomic RNAs that are translated into the viral structural and accessory proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2001) .

To control IBV infection, vaccination remains the most effective means. However, IBV infection is difficult to control because the virus has extensive genetic diversity and is constantly changing and evolving to avoid the host immune response (Jackwood et al., 2009 ). Co-infection with different IBV genotypes in the same bird makes control of infection even more difficult. By investigating the HVRs in S1 gene, the complete S1 gene and complete genomic sequences using pairwise comparison and phylogenetic analysis, we found that isolate LDL/150434-I was most likely reisolation of H120 vaccine strain. This result was confirmed by our virulent study in which SPF chickens were inoculated with isolate LDL/ 150434-I and showed no clinical signs. This was expected considering that the diseased flock had been vaccinated with H120 strain at age 60 days, although the respiratory signs appeared at approximately 30 days later. It has been demonstrated that IBV vaccine strains, such as H120, may persist in chickens with maternal antibodies and that periodically shed virus from the trachea and cloaca for 77 days post-inoculation (Naqi et al., 2003) . Moreover, H120 live vaccine is able to spread extensively within groups of chickens vaccinated at different ages (Matthijs et al., 2008) . Hence, the vaccine strains may be transmitted between chickens after introduction into the chicken flocks by vaccination, and accumulations of genetic mutations in the viral genome occur later. The persistence and transmission of vaccine strains might provide protection against homologous strains. However, incomplete protection against heterologous strains might result from co-existence of vaccine and heterologous strains in the same bird, as found in our study, and give rise to recombination events between these different genotypes (Chen et al., 2015) . Therefore, infection with multiple types of virus in the same chicken might be a result of multiple independent introductions of different IBV genotypes/variants; some of which might be related to vaccination or later transmission of vaccine strains between chickens, and later accumulation of mutations and recombination events between these genotypes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 161, "end": 182, "text": "(de Wit et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 500, "end": 522, "text": "(Jackwood et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1408, "text": "(Naqi et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1547, "text": "(Matthijs et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 2089, "end": 2108, "text": "(Chen et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Both phylogenetic and amino acid substitution analysis based on the S1 genes showed that the isolate LDL/150434-III was a TW I-like virus of GI-7 lineage (Valastro et al., 2016) . Although isolate LDL/150434-III was similar to those of known TW I strains, it consisted of a new sublineage that was markedly distinct from established TW I virus of GI-7 lineage. The amino acid substitutions and deletions were found in the S1 subunit of S protein of isolate LDL/150434-III, compared to those of the known TW-I viruses. This suggests that TW I-like viruses have undergone extensive evolution, with diverse strains circulating in chicken flocks since they emerged in Mainland China 10 years ago , and have become endemic in Mainland China (Xu et al., , 2018 .

However, respiratory system disease, kidney damage, decreased egg production, cystic oviducts and mortality were observed in commercial layers and SPF chickens infected with nrTW I viruses Gao et al., 2016) . Although the chickens from which LDL/150434-III was isolated showed mild to severe tracheitis and some showed nephritis, this virus did not induce obvious clinical signs in SPF chickens. This is not surprising because no relationship exists between pathotype and genotype (Wang and Huang, 2000) . IBV strains have variable pathogenicity in chickens and some strains commonly persist in chickens in the absence of clinical disease (Jones and Ambali, 1987) . Recombination among human or animal coronaviruses has been described previously (Herrewegh et al., 1998; Lau et al., 2010 Lau et al., , 2011 Sabir et al., 2016) .Recombination is also a well-recognized mechanism by which IBVs generate diversity. In this study, inconsistent phylogenetic clustering between the S1 gene and complete genomic sequence was found in isolate LDL/150434-II, implicating the occurrence of recombination events in the genome of LDL/150434-II. However, we should be cautious when we interpret the possible recombination events solely on the basis of inconsistent phylogenetic clustering in trees based on different viral genes, to avoid drawing premature conclusions. Hence, SimPlot and MAFFT analyses were used to investigate the recombination and the results revealed evidence of recombination for IBV isolate LDL/150434-II. In line with previous evidence in other coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2005; Licitra et al., 2014) , the junction was found to be located between ORF1b and S of isolate LDL/150434-II, which was the most frequently identified location for the recombination breakpoints. The high occurrence of recombination between IBVs could be mostly likely due to the presence of co-infection or re-infection with IBVs with multiple genotypes/serotypes in the same bird. For recombination as a consequence of mixed infections, we believe that widespread use of vaccines that offer incomplete protection against heterotypic IBVs may play an important role in the emergence of such novel genetic variants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 812, "end": 833, "text": "(Wang and Tsai, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1170, "text": "Gao et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1467, "text": "(Wang and Huang, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1627, "text": "(Jones and Ambali, 1987)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1734, "text": "(Herrewegh et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1751, "text": "Lau et al., 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1770, "text": "Lau et al., , 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1790, "text": "Sabir et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2534, "end": 2552, "text": "(Woo et al., 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2553, "end": 2574, "text": "Licitra et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 688, "end": 695, "text": "Fig. 2B", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Previous studies have indicated the synergistic mechanism between IBV and AIV-H9N2, possibly by trypsin-like proteases encoded by coronaviruses that enhance the AIV-H9N2 hemagglutinin cleavage (Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2017) , which increases replication and pathogenicity of AIV-H9N2. In this study, we did not find any synergistic effects on pathogenicity when different types of IBV co-infected SPF chickens. Replication and infection of IBV are primarily initiated in the respiratory tract regardless of the tissue tropism of the strains. From the respiratory tract, the virus spreads through the host via viremia (Jones and Jordan, 1972) to the ciliated epithelium of the oviduct, causing necrosis and malformation (Chousalkar and Roberts, 2007; Crinion et al., 1971; Jones and Jordan, 1971) , and to the renal tubular epithelial cells, causing renal failure with urate obstruction due to tubular necrosis with mononuclear inflammation Itakura, 1996, 1997; Condron and Marshall, 1986; Jones, 1974; Purcell et al., 1976) . The severity of the disease in various organs depends on the IBV subtype and ultimately determines the mortality in chickens. Single and combined infections with our three isolates did not cause obvious clinical signs and we did not evaluate the histopathological lesions. However, we found that viruses persisted in the respiratory tract longer in some chickens incombined infected group than those in individually infected group. Further study is needed to confirm the results on pathogenicity of different IBV types using more virulent strains, especially with different tropism, to evaluate whether damage in different organs caused by strains with different tropism has synergistic effects on pathogenicity when the birds are co-infected.
