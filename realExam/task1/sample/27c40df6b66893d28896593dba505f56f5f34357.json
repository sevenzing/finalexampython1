Several RT-qPCR-based tests are being used in clinical settings 2, and novel approaches are continually being reported [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . All methods require an RNA extraction step to isolate the viral genetic material before its detection. Unfortunately, RNA extraction has become a serious bottleneck for COVID-19 diagnosis around the world due to shortages in RNA-extraction kits customarily used to process patients samples. This is particularly troublesome in developing countries lacking the infrastructure and capacities to produce these kits locally. Before the kit-era, which contributed to standardize and simplify molecular biology work, several RNA extraction methods were routinely used in research laboratories around the world. RNA isolation procedures typically involve three general steps: cell lysis, separation of RNA from other macromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, followed by RNA concentration. To prevent RNA degradation, cell lysis must be conducted under conditions that inhibit RNase activity, which is abundant in many cellular compartments 11, 12 . RNA separation from other macromolecules is often achieved by a combination of pH and organic solvents, such as phenol/chloroform [13] [14] [15] [16] .

As shown in Figure 1 , three of the five procedures evaluated yielded enough RNA to amplify the RNase P target gene, whereas two of them did not. The Trizol approach was most effective, exhibiting the highest yield ( Figure 1) . The BSA-based protocol also allowed for amplification of the RNase P target, albeit with lower yield and significant variability among replicates (Figure 1 ). Acid pH-based method also allowed amplification of the target, though with lower yields when compared to the TRIzol method ( Figure 1 ). The direct method and high-temperature method did not yield enough RNA to amplify the RNase P gene under our experimental conditions. While TRIzol appears to be the best experimental procedure in terms of yield, it is not easy to use for a diagnostics laboratory setting as it requires a chemical hood for the organic extraction step. Biosafety cabinets class II (BSL-2) necessary for operator protection are not appropriate for working with organic solvents. BSA, Trizol, and acid-pH procedures provided comparable yields, but the acid-pH method was more consistent among replicates. Based on these considerations, we decided to validate the acid-pH method to extract RNA from clinical samples, using the High Pure viral RNA extraction kit (Roche) as the gold standard.

We analyzed 50 clinical samples: 22 were positive, 11 were undetermined, and 17 were negative according to RT-qPCR recommended by CDC using RNA extracted with HighPure viral RNA columns (Roche). Undetermined samples are described as having a viral load around the detection limit of the RT-qPCR method. The results for the 50 samples are shown in Table 1 . The 17 negative samples were also negative using RNA extracted with the acid pH method. Out of 22 positive samples, 21 were also positive using RNA extracted with the acid pH method, whereas one sample was undetermined. Out of 11 undetermined samples analyzed, 4 were still undetermined using RNA extracted with the acid pH method. However, 3 of them were negative, and 4 of them were positive. The CT values for N1 and N2 obtained using Roche kit were slightly higher on average than the values obtained using the acid pH method ( Figure  2A ), but this difference was not statistically significant (p-value = 0.40 and 0.82 respectively). This analysis was done for positive and undetermined samples. The arithmetic difference between CT values obtained using Roche kit and acid pH method was on average positive for N1 and N2 targets (1.57 and 0.47 respectively) ( Figure 2B ), meaning that CTs were lower for the acid pH method. As shown in Figure 2A , CT values for the RNase P gene obtained using Roche kit were slightly lower than the average obtained by the acid pH method, but this difference was not statistically significant (pvalue = 0.07).

We validated this method using 50 clinical samples with results comparable to those obtained with commercial kits. There are three key aspects of this method that must be pointed out. First, the acid pH-based methods that we reviewed 11, 15, 21 are intended for RNA extraction from tissue, cultured cells, and cell-associated virus. Therefore, the first step of these protocols is centrifugation with subsequent lysis of the cell pellet. However, we need to recover free viral particles in solution, which do not sediment after routine centrifugation at 15,000 g. For this reason, we used the uncentrifuged sample directly mixed with lysis buffer, with subsequent precipitation of viral RNA in the whole mix volume. Using uncentrifuged sample is the critical step for efficient RNA recovery because when a centrifuged sample was used in preliminary tests, CT values were much higher than those obtained with Roche kit. Second, the acid pH method uses the anionic detergent Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that can lyse cells and viral coats through disruption of noncovalent bonds in proteins, causing them to lose their native conformation 11 . Third, low pH and high concentration of salt make possible the selective recovery of RNA. Within the pH range of 5.5 to 6.0, RNA degradation is minimized 21 . RNA phosphodiester bond is more stable at acidic than alkaline pH, where it is susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis at pH greater than 6 22 . Acid hydrolysis can only occur at pH lower than 2 23, 24 . Moreover, DNA and RNA have different solubility at different pH, mainly due to the 2' hydroxyl group of RNA, which increases the polarity of this nucleic acid 25, 26 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 395, "end": 398, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 399, "end": 402, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 403, "end": 405, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1301, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1458, "end": 1460, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1598, "end": 1600, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1653, "end": 1656, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1659, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1821, "end": 1824, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1825, "end": 1827, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is worth mentioning that all of the samples that changed their report had CT values that were around the cutoff value of 40.

This experimental procedure utilizes low-cost reagents and equipment that can be found in standard molecular biology laboratories. The cost of extraction is a critical issue in most clinical laboratories, and the cost of our in-house method is around ten times lower than extraction kits. Moreover, DNase treatment is not necessary because SARS-CoV-2 detection is not altered in the presence of DNA. Residual DNA may serve as the template for RNase P gene amplification. Because of current environmental concerns, we would also like to highlight the lower plastic contamination generated by this in-house method. Column-based extraction kits use several disposable tubes per sample, columns, bottles of buffer solutions, and plastic bags. Our in-house extraction method is, by far, much more environmental friendly; it requires only two eppendorf tubes per sample.
