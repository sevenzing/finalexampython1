A microcantilever modified by FIP type I anti-viral antiserum was developed for the detection of FIP type I virus. When the FIP type I virus positive sample is injected into the fluid cell where the microcantilever is held, the microcantilever bends upon the recognition of the FIP type I virus by the antiserum on the surface of the microcantilever. A negative control sample that does not contain FIP type I virus did not cause any bending of the microcantilever. The detection limit of the sensor was 0.1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 when the assay time was <1 h.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory disease, first emerged in the Guangdong province in China during November 2002 [1, 2] . Within a span of a few months, the disease spread rapidly in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world. The epidemic spanned almost 30 countries and created a global alert [1, 3] . SARS is characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache and dyspnoea and may progress to generalized interstitial infiltrates in the lungs requiring artificial ventilation. The fatality rate may be as high as 15% [4, 5] . SARS is believed to have originated from healthy Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), a catlike mammal closely related to the mongoose. The causative organism for this disease was a coronavirus, called the SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) belong to a family of large, enveloped, positive sense, single stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal host cells. The genomes of the coronavirus are the largest of the RNA viruses ranging from 27 kb to 32 kb in length. The virus varies from 100-140 nm in diameter. The viral particles have characteristic surface projections called peplomers, which are about 20 nm long and 10 nm wide. This crown-like appearance (Latin-Corona ) gives the virus family its name [5] .",

Selectivity of the microcantilevers can be achieved by modifying the surface of the microcantilevers by coatings or by covalently binding molecular recognition agents for identification of chemically or biologically specific species. Microcantilevers possess the unique characteristic of bending under the influence of differential stresses produced when the molecular adsorption is confined to one side of the cantilever [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Microcantilever sensors bend in both air and solution. Four methods may be used for cantilever detection, namely optical [17] , piezoresistive [18] , piezoelectric [19] and capacitive [20] .",
