The genetic material in the core called ss-RNA is responsible for virus replication. Matrix proteins are closely bound to the outer envelope to protect the core of the virus and maintain the spatial structure. In fact, there is small amount of membrane proteins (M2) besides matrix protein (M1) in the skeleton. M2 protein has the function of ion channel (mainly Na + channel) and regulating pH value in membrane. The outer surface is mainly composed of phospholipid bilayer with two significant kinds of glycoprotein protrusions, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), 5 the former can assist the fusion of virus envelope and host cell membrane while the latter has the ability of hydrolyzing sialic acid to cut off the connection between them. 6, 7 Unlike the structure of influenza virus, coronavirus with a diameter of 60 to 220 nm has the largest genome among all RNA viruses which has been found currently, it can be divided into four genera, named \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4, \u03b1-type includes porcine epidemic \u03b3-type contains avian infectious bronchitis while the last one includes parrot coronavirus (PaCoV) and porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV). 8 There are three types of glycoproteins existed on the surface of the membrane: spike protein (S), envelope protein (E), and membrane protein (M), the spike protein will form large protrusions on the virus surface and lead to the crown-like appearance. It is worth mentioning that the E and M protein participate in virus assembly while the S protein mediates the entrance of host cells. 9 In terms of infective mode, influenza virus is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis and sialic acids which are distributed on the host cells and are absolutely important in the entry progress.",

However, the coronavirus is much more infectious due to the huge damage to respiratory tract, not only can it cause fibrosis in the lungs, but also lead to spleen shrinking, myocardial cell necrosis, hepatobiliary congestion and brain edema. Chest tightness and dyspnea are common symptoms in patients infected coronavirus and severe patients developed rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction. 2 The most terrible sequela is the impairment of pulmonary repair function caused by pulmonary fibrosis. 23, 24 At first, the source of SARS was locked in civet cats by experts. But according to more in-depth researches, bats were found to be the final producers of SARS-CoV. 23 It is alarming that there are many similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, such as propagation characteristics, epidemiology, and acting mechanism, and so on, 25 cating that the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2 may be located in the lower airway. 29 It has been generally accepted that the parameter scientists use to determine how easy the virus to spread is known as the \"basic reproduction number,\" or R0, it has been reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is around 2.68 with 2.47 to 2.86 of 95% credible interval, this means although its propagation characteristics are similar to SARS-CoV, the former is less contagious than the latter. 24, 30 At present, the mortality of COVID-19 in China is 4.1%, 3 lower than 9.6% of SARS reported by WHO. 31 ",

Based on the previous results, most of the patients, aged from 25 to 49 and about 30% were aged from 50 to 64. In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to all populations, but the elderly and patients with chronic diseases are more likely to suffer severe conditions after infection because the elderly are not as resistant as young people due to the degradation of various physiological functions. It is also worth mentioning that pregnant women and infants are also susceptible groups, mainly due to their low immunity. 34, 35 On February 5, 2020, a newborn infant that was delivered by his infected mother during the epidemic in Wuhan had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, this reminds us that the virus not only spread by respiratory droplets and close contact, but also by mother-to-child transmission. 35 Meanwhile, it is possible to propagate through aerosols when exposed to high concentration aerosols for a long time in a closed environment.",

The place with the most serious epidemic in China is Hubei province, and up to now, tens of thousands of people have been infected which occupied 83% of all those people infected in China. As of 24:00 on April 2, according to the reports from National Health Commission of 31 provinces and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 81 620 COVID-19 cases reported in China and 67 802 cases in Hubei province, among which 50 007 cases in Wuhan. The number of the death cases in Hubei accounts for almost all of that in China (3203 of 3322 cases). 3 The good news is that since February 12, the number of newly confirmed cases in China has declined. Up to now (April 2, 2020), the number of daily newly confirmed and suspected cases in China has dropped below 50 each (Figure 1). However, it should be noted that with the COVID-19 outbreak outside of China, there have been imported cases since February 26 and the number of the cases has been increasing recently (Figure 1), which is the focus of epidemic prevention and control in China currently.Recently (till April 2, 2020), the virus has spread to 205 countries/territories/areas and Europe and Americas have more daily new cases than other regions(Figure 2",

The team obtained the whole genome sequence of the virus from five early patients. The sequence similarity of the viruses from five patients reached 99.9%, and the sequence consistency with that of SARS-CoV was 79.5%. 2 Then they compared the SARS-CoV-2 genome with some gene sequences of the coronaviruses early detected in the laboratory, it was found that the sequence consistency of SARS-CoV-2 and a bat coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13) was as high as 96%. Not long ago, it was reported that the spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) of a virus isolated from pangolin showed similarity of 90.4, 100, 98.2, and 96.7% to that of the novel coronavirus, this means that pangolin is likely to be a potential intermediate host for the novel coronavirus. 22 Coronavirus is a kind of RNA virus with envelope and linear single positive-strand genome. It is a large class of viruses widely existing in nature. The genome is about 27 to 32 kb in length, and it is the largest virus among RNA viruses currently known.

The blood vessels of alveolar septum were congested and edematous, mononuclear, and lymphocytic infiltration and intravascular transparent thrombosis can be seen. Some alveoli exudates were organized and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis was observed. Under the electron microscope, coronavirus particles were found in the bronchial mucosal epithelium and cytoplasm of type II alveolar epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that novel coronavirus antigen was positive in some alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages, and novel coronavirus DNA was detected positive by RT-PCR. 2 Spleen, hilar lymph nodes, and bone marrow: The spleen was significantly reduced. Macrophages proliferated and phagocytosis was observed in spleen. The number of lymphocytes was significantly reduced, and the number of CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells in spleen and lymph nodes was decreased. The number of bone marrow cell lines decreased. 3 Heart and blood vessels: Degeneration and necrosis of myocardial cells can be seen. Part of the vascular endothelium shed, inflammation and thrombosis occurred.4 Liver and gallbladder: Volume increased, dark red. Hepatocyte degeneration, focal necrosis with neutrophil infiltration were observed; gallbladder was highly filled. 5 Kidney: Protein exudate can be seen in glomerular balloon cavity, renal tubular epithelial degenerated and exfoliated, transparent tubular type occurred. Interstitial hyperemia, microthrombosis, and focal fibrosis can be seen. 6 Other organs: Congestion and edema of brain tissue and degeneration of some neurons were observed. Focal necrosis was seen in the adrenal gland. The epithelium of esophagus, stomach, and intestines were denatured, necrotic, and exfoliated in different degrees. These results suggest that: (a) We should pay attention to protect the function of other related organs while giving respiratory support to patients, especially those with respiratory crisis. (b) We need to focus on the patients' immune system and take necessary measures to restore their immune function. (c) Pathological analysis of COVID-19 shows that it can cause systemic small vessel disease, including severe bleeding and microthrombosis in the lung, heart, and kidney. It reminds us to attach importance to the lesions of small blood vessels, reduce the formation of microthrombosis, and prevent the embolism of large blood vessels.",
