Knowledge about human behavior while facing emergencies has become more significant nowadays. This knowledge can help improving our already present defensive responses and natural coping mechanisms when facing imminent dangers, natural disasters, and catastrophes. A new method is here offered to explore the core points of this topic. The Emergency Reaction Questionnaire (ERQ), is proposed for predicting one's reaction and behavior in an emergency. First, a large item pool was created based on interviews with people facing emergencies on a weekly basis and related literature. The factor structure, reliability and validity were assessed on a large sample of lay people (N=1115, 440 males) and specific groups of firefighters and people doing extreme sports (N=85, all males). Participants were Caucasian with an age range of 18-70. We also used measures of anxiety, depression, and sensation seeking, behavioral inhibition and activation and coping in stressful situations.

For example, when crossing a road and a car approaches at high speed, one might freeze for too long (Roelofs, 2017) ; or when learning scuba diving and the mask gets filled with water one might ascent too fast (Egstrom & Bachrach, 1971) . Emergencies can occur during natural disasters such as avalanches, earthquakes, floods and hail, and human-made disasters such as a building collapse, air disasters, industrial/technological accidents, and fires. They can also occur during unexpected personal situations such as when crossing a road, riding a bicycle or driving a car, or when faced with dangerous animals or people.

To our knowledge, Tyhurst (Tyhurst, 1951) was the first to conduct an empirical study, relying on psychiatric interviews with people who had survived a community disaster, searching for individual differences. According to the results about 15% of people reacted in an organized way, 15% completely froze, could not react, and suffered shock, while the rest -70% -showed different levels of disorganized behaviour. These findings have been frequently cited (Bonanno, Brewin, Kaniasty, & La Greca, 2010; Hebb & Donderi, 2013; Mawson, 2017) , and subsequent studies confirmed that the vast majority of people behave in organized, rather than a chaotic way (Quarantelli, 1988) or even display protective behaviour towards self or others (Cocking & Drury, 2008; Drury, Cocking, & Reicher, 2009 ). Such findings may indicate the influence of social norms and evolutionary algorithms (Frankenberg, Gillespie, Preston, Sikoki, & Thomas, 2011; Frey, Savage, & Torgler, 2009; Rodr\u00edguez, Trainor, & Quarantelli, 2006) . Nonetheless, certain circumstances (e.g., confined spaces, closing paths, require to flight and when no one is at hand to help) might trigger panic (Gantt & Gantt, 2011; O'Leary, 2004) . This last condition may contribute to the favourable results of the previous studies because the majority of them investigated mass disasters focusing on individual behaviour in the community. In addition, although the concept of panic is relatively clear and reunites consensus in psychology (Craske, 1991; Craske, Barlow, & Clark, 1996) the definition of panic is not so clear when crowds are involved (Drury, Novelli, & Stott, 2013; Haghani, Cristiani, Bode, Boltes, & Corbetta, 2019) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 187, "end": 201, "text": "(Drabek, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 202, "end": 215, "text": "Mawson, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 244, "end": 259, "text": "(Tyhurst, 1951)", "ref_id": "BIBREF108"}, {"start": 675, "end": 720, "text": "(Bonanno, Brewin, Kaniasty, & La Greca, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 721, "end": 742, "text": "Hebb & Donderi, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 743, "end": 756, "text": "Mawson, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 872, "end": 891, "text": "(Quarantelli, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 952, "end": 975, "text": "(Cocking & Drury, 2008;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 976, "end": 1007, "text": "Drury, Cocking, & Reicher, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1153, "text": "(Frankenberg, Gillespie, Preston, Sikoki, & Thomas, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1184, "text": "Frey, Savage, & Torgler, 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1225, "text": "Rodr\u00edguez, Trainor, & Quarantelli, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1397, "text": "(Gantt & Gantt, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1412, "text": "O'Leary, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1722, "text": "(Craske, 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1753, "text": "Craske, Barlow, & Clark, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1819, "end": 1850, "text": "(Drury, Novelli, & Stott, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1902, "text": "Haghani, Cristiani, Bode, Boltes, & Corbetta, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Nonetheless, police, fire-fighters and rescue personnel are often required to behave in counterintuitive ways. First responders with no previous experience in disaster management, disaster response, or counterterrorism will be more easily confused or overwhelmed when facing new emergencies (Gheytanchi et al., 2007) . This way we find the common and essential ingredient that is required to link emergencies/disasters literature with the fear related literature here in question, which entails particularly the organism defensive responses (LeDoux, 2012 (LeDoux, , 2014 LeDoux & Daw, 2018) . Throughout the evolution, humans were often attacked by predators (Hart & Sussman, 2011) and faced natural disasters and other emergencies such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes. The original predatory defense system then have been co-opted, shaped by natural selection, to cope with all threats, allowing for surviving and leave genes to the offspring (LeDoux & Daw, 2018) . Thus, both predators and natural disasters trigger the same defensive system (Bracha, 2006) . These mechanisms have a biologically prepared nature but are not fully automatic (Coelho & Purkis, 2009 ). Defensive reaction and action circuits likely interact (Cardinal, Parkinson, Hall, & Everitt, 2002) , and fear itself interferes with the defensive mechanisms at some point., as the medial prefrontal cortex play a key role in the modulation of fear-related processing (Adolphs, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 291, "end": 316, "text": "(Gheytanchi et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 541, "end": 554, "text": "(LeDoux, 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 555, "end": 570, "text": "(LeDoux, , 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 571, "end": 590, "text": "LeDoux & Daw, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 659, "end": 681, "text": "(Hart & Sussman, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 985, "end": 1005, "text": "(LeDoux & Daw, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1099, "text": "(Bracha, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1205, "text": "(Coelho & Purkis, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1264, "end": 1308, "text": "(Cardinal, Parkinson, Hall, & Everitt, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1477, "end": 1492, "text": "(Adolphs, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Consequently, individual differences in perception, evaluation of information, and personality play a role and might also need to be accessed, depending on the objectives (Couyoumdjian et al., 2016) . But in terms of emergencies, what seems more important to evaluate is how the person actually behaves during such situations. This is true because there are low correlations between feelings, thoughts, open behaviour (e.g., avoidance) and physiological responses (Allen, Allen, Austin, Waldron, & Ollendick, 2015; Fenz & Epstein, 1967; Rachman, 1974; Rachman & Hodgson, 1974) , known as synchrony-desynchrony in measures of fear. In addition, these evolutionarily conserved defensive survival circuits that account for the behavioural and physiological responses to threats are not directly responsible for subjective experiences of fear (Ledoux & Brown, 2017) . These detection-action circuits might have a prewired component facilitating prompt responses to some evolutionary relevant threats. For example, panic can lead to improper control of these defensive actions causing further danger by leading to a poorly calibrated flight/fight/freeze response. Further, after noticing the bodily sensations, such as increased breathing rate, and palpitations, followed by some threat, some people believe these sensations have harmful physical, social, or cognitive consequences (McNally, 2002) . This is often called Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) and white matter in the insula and adjacent temporo-parieto-limbic regions seems to correlate with it (Kim, Kim, Kiu Choi, & Lee, 2017 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 171, "end": 198, "text": "(Couyoumdjian et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 464, "end": 514, "text": "(Allen, Allen, Austin, Waldron, & Ollendick, 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 515, "end": 536, "text": "Fenz & Epstein, 1967;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 537, "end": 551, "text": "Rachman, 1974;", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 552, "end": 576, "text": "Rachman & Hodgson, 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 839, "end": 861, "text": "(Ledoux & Brown, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 1377, "end": 1392, "text": "(McNally, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 1543, "end": 1575, "text": "(Kim, Kim, Kiu Choi, & Lee, 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Gorman's \"fear network model (FNM)\" suggests that inadequate control of fear response by the frontal areas will provoke panic attacks, as these should modulate the exaggerated fear reactions of the limbic regions properly. The center of this fear model is the amygdala, which is connected with medial frontal cortex and hippocampus for the control of fear response and fear memory (Gorman, Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000; Lai, 2019; Sobanski & Wagner, 2017) . Presently, the vast majority of panic attacks are due to false alarms (Nesse, 2005 ) that trigger a brain prewired to overrespond. But these connections can also be wired or rewired via experience to calibrate stimuli detection and responses to threats (Gross & Canteras, 2012; LeDoux, 2014) . The neural circuitry underlying these defenses usually increases the chance of surviving to predicted threats (LeDoux, 2012 (LeDoux, , 2014 , and in the presence of threat predicting cues defensive motivational circuits tend to control instrumental behaviors (LeDoux, 2014) . However, people's defensive responses can be poorly calibrated, particularly to unexpected events. Emergencies may threaten the physical integrity of those involved and require immediate responses different from the daily routine activities. Freezing, for example, seems to be an evolutionarily defensive behavior that helps to promote the perceptual assessment of threats (Blanchard, Griebel, Pobbe, & Blanchard, 2011) . Freezing helps to decide if to remain frozen or to switch to an actual defensive behavior (Eilam, 2005) such as fleeing (flight) or fighting (fight), followed by tonic immobility or fright (Bracha, 2004) . Freezing might also help potential prey to avoid capture, as the visual cortex evolved primarily for detecting moving objects and not color (Nesse, 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 381, "end": 421, "text": "(Gorman, Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 422, "end": 432, "text": "Lai, 2019;", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 433, "end": 457, "text": "Sobanski & Wagner, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 530, "end": 542, "text": "(Nesse, 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 713, "end": 737, "text": "(Gross & Canteras, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 738, "end": 751, "text": "LeDoux, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 864, "end": 877, "text": "(LeDoux, 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 878, "end": 893, "text": "(LeDoux, , 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1027, "text": "(LeDoux, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1449, "text": "(Blanchard, Griebel, Pobbe, & Blanchard, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1555, "text": "(Eilam, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1655, "text": "(Bracha, 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1798, "end": 1811, "text": "(Nesse, 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "During tonic immobility, the organism is immobile but in tachycardia and hyper-alert, prepared to flee if an opportunity takes place, in contrast with fainting, characterized by vasodilatation and extreme bradycardia (Bracha, 2004; A.

These states are multidimensional, and different components may be activated to different degrees under different conditions (LeDoux, 2014) . Physiology influences cognitions, and cognition influences feelings, which influence behavior and physiology in recursive sequence (Nesse & Ellsworth, 2009 ). The value of responses that anticipate future events helps to explain why natural selection shaped classical and operant conditioning (Nesse, 2005) , but the defensive behaviors are immediate responses, and conscious fear is not the origin of defensive behaviors elicited by threats (LeDoux, 2014) .

This is in line with previous research (Drabek, 2012; Quarantelli, 1988) claiming that most of the people involved in an emergency behave in a reasonable manner. Thus, panic and completely irrational behaviour seem rather rare, but this does not mean that most people will be a good first responder during emergency situations, and this questionnaire is adapted to that selection. The findings on gender differences in our self-report measures of emergency behaviour are also interesting. However, it is unclear at the same time whether this result represents an actual difference in emergency reaction efficiency between men and women, or whether it is a function of the increased willingness of females to endorse anxiety symptoms and helplessness. Nonetheless, our finding that males score higher on ERQ than females, and thus, expected to act in a more organized way in an emergency is in line with the findings of previous meta-analyses (Kar & Bastia, 2006; Norris et al., 2002; Tang et al., 2014) and reviews (Leach, 1994) . They claim that females are more prone to develop anxiety and other negative symptoms than males after such an event, moreover it was shown (Gidron, 2002) that those who are passive victims and cope worse with the acute situation are more likely to develop these disorders. Therefore, if the gender difference found on ERQ is indeed a real difference in an emergency, then it seems plausible that females tend to feel more lost, experience more fear, and as a consequence of their less efficient behaviour in an emergency they are more prone to develop PTSD and other issues compared to males (Kukihara et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014) . The fact that females are highly underrepresented in specific populations like firefighters and sensation seekers might support the idea that the gender difference we identified is indeed real. Still, it is also possible females that cope well in the most difficult situations, can be of more help to other females during certain emergency situations. For example, when facing situations in which one needs to be grabbed, transported or touched, skilled females might be able to deal with certain people that might feel less comfortable in the presence of a male.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 183, "end": 197, "text": "(Drabek, 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 198, "end": 216, "text": "Quarantelli, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1106, "text": "(Kar & Bastia, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1127, "text": "Norris et al., 2002;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1146, "text": "Tang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1172, "text": "(Leach, 1994)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1329, "text": "(Gidron, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1768, "end": 1791, "text": "(Kukihara et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1792, "end": 1810, "text": "Tang et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the validation study, only males were assessed as we could only find some females who were sensation seekers, and none that were firefighters.

Although automatic defensive reactions could be triggered by activity in survival circuits that detects threats (LeDoux, 2012) , facing an emergency for the first time could lead to confusion and overwhelm the person (Gheytanchi et al., 2007) . Previous experience has a huge impact on how one detects and responds to threats (Gross & Canteras, 2012; LeDoux, 2014) . If the defensive actions are recalibrated, an adequate control of fear response can be achieved (Gorman et al., 2000; Lai, 2019; Sobanski & Wagner, 2017) . Thus, the influence of social norms and evolutionary algorithms are equally important (Frankenberg et al., 2011; Frey et al., 2009; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2006) . According to Gray's theory, emotions and behaviour can be understood as the outputs of the inhibitory and activation neurological circuits (Hickey, Chelazzi, & Theeuwes, 2010) . They can be defined as avoidance (BIS) and approach (BAS) motivational systems. The BIS helps avoid harm, and BIS sensitive people tend to be more anxious in dangerous situations while BAS sensitive people are more motivated to explore new things and risk in adverse and dangerous situations. Therefore, on average lower BIS sensitivity leads to lower levels of depression and anxiety, and indeed, our results show that special groups, on average, are less anxious and are less depressed. Thus, such people tend to cope better with emergencies, as they can focus on the problem instead of their emotions.

Individuals who score high on fun-seeking are eager for reward and tend to act in the heat of the moment (Carver & White, 1994) . Thus, it seems that motivation is the key to understand the difference between the two special populations: Sensation seekers have an inner desire (on a biological basis), while firefighters are more prosocial. Specifically, people might choose to become firefighters driven by a prosocial motivation to help others, while in the case of sensation seekers, it is the biological necessity that makes them engage in (at least in others' eyes) highly dangerous situations. Importantly, the social interactions and support, comradeship in the case of firefighters, is a protective factor (Abramson et al., 2014; Bonanno et al., 2007) that can also explain their results.

Page, Rubin, Aml\u00f4t, Simpson, & Wessely, 2008; Sherman et al., 2011) . We think that this questionnaire can be the key to doing so, because it has the possibility of a quick survey even right after such an event happens, to explore the basics of this field and to allocate the questions that need to be investigated outside the laboratory. To allow for an even quicker testing, a brief version of the ERQ can be developed in the future. Results of further studies could be applied in practice, for example, to improve fire safety, train children in school how to act in an organized way in emergency situations. Moreover, major computer modelling groups that work on events and public space planning have already expressed an interest in such results and called for more psychological input (Aguirre, El-Tawil, Best, Gill, & Fedorov, 2011; Galea, 2006; K\u00f6ster, Seitz, Treml, Hartmann, & Klein, 2011) .

Given the limitations and paucity of previous research associated with emergency behavior, the present findings are promising as we seek to establish a new way of studying this area. Of course, these are the first steps towards a new method. Future studies are still needed to gather more data from both average and special populations (e.g. police officers, members of the army), create standards for age groups and genders. Further validity must be sought, for instance by testing rookies at special rescue forces and the fire department, in a longitudinal setting from the application through to the point where they become qualified, and then after working for a year. Rescue workers and ambulance personnel have been shown to have much higher prevalence of PTSD than that of the general population (Berger et al., 2012) . Our questionnaire can help shed a light on the background of this problem, and also be useful in selection and implementing preventive measures for personnel. Future studies can also test people who have never been in an emergency situation before but are willing to undergo specific training and see how they react and improve.
