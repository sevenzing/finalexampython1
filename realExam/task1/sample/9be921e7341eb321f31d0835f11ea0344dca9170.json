However, there is some debate as to the extent to which US police are connected to these principles (Adegbile, 2017) , as there are more than 18,000 police departments in the US that are subject to different laws and codes (U.S. Department of Justice, n.d.). In the UK, Peelian principles have also influenced policing (The Home Ofice, n.d), but the sections of the Policing Vision 2025 of relevance to community policing are focused on 'protecting and reassuring communities' (NPCC, 2015) . Whether community policing strategies seek to reduce fear and bias, or protect and reassure communities, policing efforts can be hampered by a range of factors including: power imbalances and inequality (e.g. Gasper, 2012); prejudice (Kochel, Wilson, & Mastrofski 2011) ; and by a lack of clear or transparent policies or procedures (see Brucato, 2015, for a commentary). These issues contribute to mistrust (Ray, Marsh, & Powelson, 2017) and an asymmetry in citizen-police collaboration (e.g. Fulla & Welch, 2002) 1. Goldsmith (2005) described trust as the ways that interactions and experiences contribute to expectations about future treatment. Based on three presumptions, summarised by Six (2003) as benevolence, dedication and ethics, Goldsmith lists nine behaviours that contribute to mistrust in police. These are: neglect; indifference; incompetence; discrimination; brutality; venality; extortion; intimidation; and excessive force. Goldsmith also proposed that trust can be increased with accountability, and listed three key actions of information, influence, and control (identified by Six, 2003) to achieve this.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 53, "end": 66, "text": "Peel's (1929)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 128, "end": 173, "text": "The Law Enforcement Action Partnership, n.d.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 369, "end": 385, "text": "(Adegbile, 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 746, "end": 758, "text": "(NPCC, 2015)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 995, "end": 1030, "text": "(Kochel, Wilson, & Mastrofski 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1199, "text": "(Ray, Marsh, & Powelson, 2017)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1275, "text": "Fulla & Welch, 2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1279, "end": 1295, "text": "Goldsmith (2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1870, "text": "Six, 2003)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "It is in the interest of police and citizens to foster trust, as there is a robust association between police trustworthiness (Goldsmith, 2005) , fairness and/or perceived legitimacy (Jackson, Bradford, Stanko, & Hohl, 2012) , and cooperation with police (see Cao, 2014, for a commentary). Fostering trust has become urgent in the advent of the widespread use of social media, as civilians are able to share police data. For instance, genuine mistakes, such as the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes (2005) ; incidents of inappropriate behaviour (Weitzer, 2006) ; incompetency or coverups (e.g. the death of Christian Andreacchio; Tenderfoot TV & Black Mountain Media, 2019); or police brutality (e.g. the killings of Freddie Gray, Undisclosed, 2017; and George Floyd, BBC, 2020) are all accessible online.

They can involve interactive \"smart\" systems that are scalable (Chaudhari, Dal, Nikhare, Dayal, & Golghate, 2018) to diverse needs and interests of individuals or communities (Mills, 2011) . They can also encourage people to get involved in 'citizen forensics' such as sharing evidence, advocacy, or 'web sleuthing'. This is a practice where people use publicly-available resources to conduct amateur investigations, in an attempt to solve crimes (e.g. Yardley, Lynes, Wilson, & Kelly, 2018) , such as 'Facebook identifications' (Mack & Sampson, 2013) before attending an official police lineup, or searching for missing people (Cruz-Santiago, 2017) . There are also an increasing number of crime-solving websites (e.g. crimemuseum.org), forums (e.g.WebSleuths.com), and podcasts (e.g. Undisclosedpodcast.com), which can appeal to people's interest in solving crime. Web sleuthing justifiably raises concerns about vigilantism (e.g. Campbell, 2016). However, a recent literature review by Yardley et al. found that under four percent of web sleuthing activities were related to concerns about vigilantism, while almost ninety one percent were beneficial (e.g. content co-creation and exchange). This suggests that web sleuthing can be helpfully integrated into criminal justice systems (Huey Nhan, & Broll, 2013) , for instance via Police Support Officers (Home Office, 2016) , provided that digital technologies are designed to minimise vigilantism.

However, despite only selecting apps whose landing pages gave the impression of two-way communication, in reality, only a small minority allowed for truly dyadic communication. Thus, it appears that two-way police and citizens do not yet communicate in this way when it comes to digital mechanisms. When it came to comparing third party and police apps, third party apps tended to focus on empowering citizens, while police apps tended to position police as separate from citizens, focusing on safeguarding, sharing top-down information, and police-led engagement. However, surprisingly, police apps took no more steps to reassure users than third party apps, and their privacy policies were equally difficult to read, so they probably largely failed to attain informed consent from users. This is of particular concern when user data is being collected without users' knowledge, for instance if they think they are making an anonymous report, but their location is known to the app host. As trust in policing is key to citizen cooperation, and we are increasingly living digital lives, if police forces are considering providing or updating a digital mechanism to communicate with citizens, it would be worth ensuring that the mechanism is, and is seen to be, trustworthy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "created a Sex"}, {"text": "Step 1: (These inclusion/exclusion decisions were taken from data generated by", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix A Inclusion and Exclusion Steps"}, {"text": "Communication systems selected by the computing team (1208) were reviewed independently by authors from the psychology department, and selected for further review according to certain Google Play \"app_categories\".
