That is the main question behind this psychological study. Based on a working model of compassionate love (Underwood 2008), the priestly compassionate love model was tested to determine whether spirituality, social support, priestly commitment, and well-being simultaneously influence compassionate love, which in turn brings out a positive affect in those doing pastoral ministry. The participants were 256 Catholic priests in Indonesia. Using structural equation modeling, the results of the study showed a good fit. Spirituality was the factor that contributed most strongly to compassionate love. Receiving adequate support from multiple sources motivated the priests to love others. Moreover, priestly commitment also influenced the priests to love others compassionately. Although well-being did not significantly influence compassionate love, it still played an important role in the model because it was correlated with all factors. Finally, the results showed that compassionate love powerfully influenced the priests to be enthusiastic and eager in doing pastoral ministry. These findings are discussed theoretically and practically in the context of priestly life and ministry in Indonesia.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Giving one's self for others, which is well known scientifically as compassionate love, should be in the hearts of Catholic priests while they are engaged in pastoral ministry (Congregation for the Clergy 2016).

Weaver et al. (2002) mentioned that priests are required to fulfill many responsibilities for parishioners and that the community places heavy demands on their time and energy. Priests are expected to simultaneously fulfill a variety of roles that include administrator, teacher, preacher, counselor, fundraiser and to engage in other pastoral ministries such as home visits, communal prayers, and providing spiritual advice. They should be ready and 'on call' to compassionately help and counsel people who have problems. Due to their likelihood of being exposed to stress, human suffering, and other crises through the parishioners they serve, priests are at increased risk of work-related stress, burnout, and compassion fatigue (Francis et al. 2009; Lewis et al. 2007; Pfeil 2006) . Pastoral counseling responsibilities have been reported as contributing to higher levels of stress and compassion fatigue (Pector 2005; Roberts et al. 2003; Stone et al. 2003; Weaver et al. 2003) . Taking on multiple roles and multiple parishes, has also been highlighted as one of the contextual factors contributing to stress for priests (Isacco et al. 2014) .
