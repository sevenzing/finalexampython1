The calculated analytical detection limit of the assay (e.g., 0.62 input copies/reaction, corresponding to 93 copies/mL individual donor plasma at 95% probability of detection for pooled samples) appears to be extraordinarily high compared to other pool-based RT-PCR tests. 12,24 Because a 95 percent detection limit below 2 to 5 input copies per reaction is regarded as unrealistic even in ultrasensitive assays, we assume that the external quantification standard is underestimated by at least one deci-mal power.

Even though people with smooth symptoms could stay undiagnosed by the physician. In such cases NAT could be the only method to analyze viremic patients in early stages of the disease. Although up to now asymptomatic blood carriage of SARS-CoV has not been reported, blood transfusion services should be aware of such a possibility to maintain the high level of blood safety. In the present study we demonstrate the feasibility of screening blood donors for SARS-CoV on a routine basis. An early diagnostic test, detecting viremia in people before they show clinical symptoms, in combination with quarantine measurements, could efficiently reduce the spread of the disease. 26 The example of Canada showed that a new outbreak is possible any time. [27] [28] [29] On the basis of current knowledge a return of the disease cannot be ruled out completely. Particularly the origin of the virus is assumed to be the civet cat, which could not be quarantined. 30 To improve safety of blood products we could show that our blood transfusion service can screen blood products for the presence of SARS CoV on a routine basis if necessary. Together with West Nile virus the global SARS outbreak demonstrates that NAT enables new test systems to be developed very early after sequencing of essential parts of the genome of the emerging viruses. With the modern NAT blood transfusion services can adopt routine testing for newly emerging viruses immediately after their identification and improve blood safety. Although the technical and analytical prerequisites for NAT testing are fulfilled by the test, it is still not clear whether there might be nonpathogenic or unrecognized viruses resembling SARS-CoV in healthy populations.
