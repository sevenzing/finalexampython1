            "text": "Given her active COVID-19 disease she was started initially on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at 1 g/kg/day rather than prednisone. Despite this, she required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells, and after three days was started on prednisone 60 mg/day. This led to stabilization of her blood counts. She completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine. During her hospital stay, her LDH rose from 296 to 553 U/l, falling to 355 U/l at discharge, and haptoglobin remained low. Her reticulocyte count was normal (95\u00c14 9 10 3 /ll) on admission and rose to 206 9 10 3 /ll at discharge. Her pneumonia improved and she was discharged on a prednisone taper on hospital day 8. At followup after one week, her haemoglobin was 11 g/l and LDH was normal. correspondence AIHA (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia) is the destruction of red cells by autoantibodies. While many cases are idiopathic, others have been associated with certain drugs, autoimmune disease or malignancies. Rare cases have been reported with Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. 1 Patient had been started on azithromycin three days before admission but this drug has not been associated with AIHA and it would be unusual for it to present within such a short timeframe. Upon presentation, our patient had a warm antibody (IgG) haemolytic anaemia along with COVID-19 disease. Because of concerns for causing immunosuppression and worsening viral shedding, she was first started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), but did not have a response, which is consistent with the literature showing a poor response to IVIG in AIHA. 2 Her blood count stabilized with prednisone, which will be tapered. We suspect that as her infection clears this will also resolve the AIHA.",
