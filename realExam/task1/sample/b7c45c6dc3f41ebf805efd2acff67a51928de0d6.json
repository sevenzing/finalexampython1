            "text": "ABSTRACT: Current biotechnological applications such as biosensors, protein arrays, and microchips require oriented immobilization of enzymes. The characteristics of recognition, self-assembly and ease of genetic manipulation make inorganic binding peptides an ideal molecular tool for site-specific enzyme immobilization. Herein, we demonstrate the utilization of gold binding peptide (GBP1) as a molecular linker genetically fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP) and immobilized on gold substrate. Multiple tandem repeats (n \u00bc 5, 6, 7, 9) of gold binding peptide were fused to N-terminus of AP (nGBP1-AP) and the enzymes were expressed in E. coli cells. The binding and enzymatic activities of the bi-functional fusion constructs were analyzed using quartz crystal microbalance spectroscopy and biochemical assays. Among the multiple-repeat constructs, 5GBP1-AP displayed the best bi-functional activity and, therefore, was chosen for self-immobilization studies. Adsorption and assembly properties of the fusion enzyme, 5GBP1-AP, were studied via surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. We demonstrated self-immobilization of the bi-functional enzyme on micro-patterned substrates where genetically linked 5GBP1-AP displayed higher enzymatic activity per area compared to that of AP. Our results demonstrate the promising use of inorganic binding peptides as sitespecific molecular linkers for oriented enzyme immobilization with retained activity. Directed assembly of proteins on solids using genetically fused specific inorganic-binding peptides has Introduction Immobilization of proteins through self-assembly onto solid surfaces with high affinity and material selectivity is an essential component in building up protein chips, protein microarrays, and biosensors (Bailey et al., 2007; Jung et al., 2008; Kwon et al., 2006; Rusmini et al., 2007; Tomizaki et al., 2005; Watzke et al., 2006) . Although, there are many methods for protein immobilization on to solid surfaces, site-specific protein immobilization has been increasingly used to maintain protein conformation and retained biological activity on selected solid surfaces (Kumada et al., 2006; Kwon et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006) . Existing protein immobilization methods are mostly based on non-specific adsorption via, for example, intermolecular forces, mainly ionic bonds and hydrophobic and polar interactions, or chemical coupling reactions which mostly lead to uncontrolled attachment of the proteins on to solid surfaces (Kwon et al., 2006; Rusmini et al., 2007) . For example, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of thiol-and silane-based molecules on solid substrates (i.e., gold and silica, respectively) are widely used for various chemical and biological surface functionalization (Babu et al., 2004; Neves-Petersen et al., 2006; Mrksich and Whitesides, 1996) . These synthetic molecules provide an intermediary molecular layer between the surface and the functional proteins. Using thiol or silane molecules as linkers, proteins are usually immobilized on to solid surfaces in a random orientation, often resulting in a limited or loss of biological activity since the site-specific chemical reaction between functional groups on protein and the activated support surface can still be difficult to control. Moreover, this approach requires complex chemistries for efficient coupling (Norde, 1986; Zhen et al., 2006) which, often, may not be biocompatible. There are also further limitations in these process in which, for example, in the case of gold surface, alkanethiol layers rapidly degrade due to oxidation (Park et al., 2006; Willey et al., 2005) . Current approaches, therefore, are a result of a compromise between maintaining high activity of the enzyme while having the advantage of solid immobilization via self-assembly (Bornscheuer, 2003) .",

During the last decade, combinatorial biology libraries have been employed for selection of inorganic binding peptides which are utilized as biosynthesizers, molecular linkers, and assemblers (Brown et al., 2000; Kramer et al., 2004; Kriplani and Kay, 2005; Sano et al., 2005; Sarikaya et al., 2003; Whaley et al., 2000) . Furthermore, solid-binding peptides were also selected for synthetic polymeric materials (Adey et al., 1995; Kenan et al., 2006) . Molecular biology protocols further allow tailoring of the selected peptides to tune their binding and materialselective properties so that they can be used in bionanotechnological applications, such as linkers for solid colloidal nanoparticles and flat substrates (e.g., gold or glass) (Kacar et al., 2009; Tamerler et al., 2006a) . Recently they are also used as part of a fusion protein in the development of multifunctional molecular constructs for a variety of practical applications (Dai et al., 2005; Holmes, 2002; Johnson et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2004; Sanchez et al., 2005) . Such hybrid platforms, containing genetically fused proteins with site-specific solid-binding peptides, could be potential novel ways of efficient immobilization of enzymes and receptors under ambient conditions with wide variety of applications (Brown, 1997; Ishikawa et al., 2008; Krauland et al., 2007; Kumada et al., 2006; Park et al., 2006; Zhang and Cass, 2001) .",

They were screened via random peptide libraries expressed on the outer surface of E. coli as part of the maltodextrin porin, LamB protein. Through a biopanning process, the surface bound bacteria were selected and the displayed peptide sequences were identified. Among the selected peptides, GBP1 (MHGKTQATSGTIQS) has been well characterized by our collaborative group (Brown et al., 2000; Tamerler et al., 2006a,b) . This motif does not contain cysteine which is known to form a covalent thiol linkage to gold, as in thiolated molecules that form SAMs. Naturally occurring inorganic binding proteins commonly posses repeating peptide domains, such as ice binding protein (Sicheri and Yang, 1995) , silaffin (Kroger et al., 2001) , and collagen (Rich and Crick, 1955) , providing a robust architecture and ability to self-assemble. Inspired by biology, we designed multiple repeats of gold binding peptide and demonstrated that tandem repeats, in particular the 3-repeat GBP1, enhances the gold binding activity (Tamerler et al., 2006b) . We also demonstrated that micro-patterned 3GBP1 can act as a molecular template for direct assembly of gold nanoparticles (Zin et al., 2005) . The GBP1 has proven to be an effective linker for the gold surface as it is evidenced from the increased interest and utility in the literature.",

However, histidine-tags are known to bind to gold substrate (Peelle et al., 2005; Presnova et al., 2000; Slocik and Wright, 2003) . The presence of histidine-tag, therefore, precludes the effect of GBP1 as a molecular linker for immobilization of proteins on to gold. In an earlier study, using a GBP construct, a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor was also constructed (Woodbury et al., 1998) . Here, the seven-repeat gold binding peptide (7GBP1-AP) was assembled on SPR substrate and then AP was cleaved off by trypsin from an unspecified region of GBP1, possibly still leaving a residual bound GBP1 layer on to gold which was then used to detect antibodies. Although these studies attempted to use GBP as a molecular linker, the full potential of GBP1 has not been demonstrated. First of all, producing peptide-based surface functionalization requires an examination of solid-adsorption and self-assembly properties with the isolated, full length of the peptide displayed (Seker et al., 2007; Tamerler et al., 2006b) . The utility of inorganic-binding peptides, such as GBP1, as part of a fusion protein, as we demonstrate here, is a potential approach for effectively immobilizing proteins on gold surface with retained activity.",

This program normalizes the acquired SPR spectrum using the dip in the wavelength shift at regular intervals which then is fit with a 4th-order polynomial for generating the metric sensogram as a function of time. During the experiments, a baseline was established by pumping the reaction buffer first, and then the 6-port valve (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) was switched to enzyme solution until a full saturation was achieved. The buffer was then pumped once again (at a rate of 80 mL/mL) to monitor the desorption behavior.

Starting with a minimum 3GBP1 as a fusion partner to Laccase, we also observed that 5-repeat GBP1 provided a better gold binding activity of this fusion protein (unpublished data). In this work, therefore, we started with 5-repeat GBP1 and increased the number in the tandem sequence (n \u00bc 5, 6, 7, 9) to evaluate the effect on the bi-functional activities. Multiple tandem repeats of cell surface display-selected gold binding peptide were genetically fused to the enzyme, AP, at the N-terminus. The plasmids encoding the wild-type AP and the bi-functional constructs (nGBP1-AP) were expressed in E. coli S2157 cells. The expressed enzymes were secreted from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space. Wild-type or bi-functional AP in the periplasmic fluid was purified by employing two successive steps: ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified samples were run onto SDS-PAGE to verify their purity and molecular weights ( Fig. 1a and b) . The protein bands of AP, 5GBP1-AP, 6GBP1-AP, 7GBP1-AP, and 9GBP1-AP were, approximately, at the following kDa values (compared to the theoretical molecular weights in parentheses), respectively: 46.5 (50.1), 54.5 (57.4), 55.3 (58.8), 56.0 (60.3), and 58.0 (63.1).

The dimensions of the immobilized enzymes obtained from AFM characterization are comparable with the molecular dimensions of the bacterial AP obtained from the Protein Data Bank, as: 9.77 nm \u00c2 5.40 nm \u00c2 4.75 nm (Protein Data Bank website, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home. do, 2009). Upon closer inspection in Figure 3 , it can be recognized that the 5GBP1-AP units are significantly more discrete and well packed on the surface ( Fig. 3a and b) than the wild-type AP ( Fig. 3c and d) . The peak-to-peak analyses of the topography of the images from the two substrates also yielded insights into the packing density of the particles. In the case of 5GBP1-AP, a higher packing density, with a peakto-peak separation of 11.0 AE 2.9 nm, was observed compared to AP alone, with $16.0 AE 1.5 nm, as shown in the representative cross-sectional measurements in Figure 3b and d. Since the same tip was used to produce the AFM images from both of the samples, the discrepancy in feature sizes was not seen to arise from experimental artifacts, such as tip convolution. The evidence of agglomeration in the AP sample, without the fusion peptide, can also be recognized by comparing the z (height) data between the two sets of images. From Figure 3b and d, the cross sections reveal an average height variation of almost double that of the actual size of the 5GBP1-AP (8 AE 4 nm). This observation suggests that there may be multiple layers of AP in the absence of GBP1, possibly due to agglomeration normal to the surface or misorientation of the protein with its longest axis normal to the surface. In the case of the 5GBP-AP construct, a discrete and closely packed monolayer was formed with a thickness closest to the c-dimension of AP, that is, 6 AE 1 nm. This result suggests, therefore, that the enzyme has likely been oriented right side up (i.e., enzymatic sites facing the solution) by the gold binding peptide. Additionally, Figure 3a and c also show undulating plateau-like features throughout the surface of about $30 nm, indicative of the polycrystalline gold grain structure of the underlying surface. With these observations and peak-to-peak measurements, it can be reasoned that the surface in Figure 3a and b is more indicative of a uniformly thin and oriented molecular layer than those observed in Figure 3c and d where AP was used.",

Through these studies, we also calculated the overall coverage of the enzyme on the gold surface. The control experiments for binding studies were first carried out using the control AP where we know that the enzyme alone can non-specifically bind to gold. The molecular adsorption profiles of the 5GBP1-AP, however, reveal a significant increase in adsorption, due to material specific binding activity provided to the enzyme by the gold binding peptide (Fig. 4a) . As a result, based on the Langmuir adsorption model fit to both sets of the SPR data, we find that 5GBP1-AP displays a higher surface coverage than that of the control AP (Fig. 4b) . Based on the model, the calculated kinetic parameters for both enzymes are tabulated in Table I . Depending on the concentration used, 5GBP1-AP reached to nearly 90% surface coverage with an equilibrium adsorption constant (K eq ) of 1.65 \u00c2 10 8 . This value is comparable to the adsorption of alkanethiol on gold, the first step for the gold surface functionalization prior to protein immobilization in conventional chemical approaches (Karpovich and Blanchard, 1994; Schessler et al., 1996) .",

This is possible using various lithography techniques, for example, soft lithography (Xia and Whitesides, 1998) , dippen lithography (Lee et al., 2002) , and photolithography (Revzin et al., 2001) . Taking advantage of the gold binding activity of the 5GBP1-AP fusion construct, in this part of our work, we studied whether the enzyme could be directedassembled on a patterned substrate. Among a variety of pattern fabrication methods, micro-contact printing (mCP) has proven to be a versatile technique which does not necessitate the use of expensive traditional lithographic equipments (Xia and Whitesides, 1998) . Using mCP, therefore, a variety of biological molecules can be patterned on solid surfaces with sub-micron features over a large area (>1 cm 2 ). For pattern formation, oligo (ethylene glycol)terminated alkanethiols (OH-(OCH 2 ) 3 -SH) are generally used which are known to resist protein adsorption on to gold (Prime and Whitesides, 1993) . The remaining, bare, gold regions are then functionalized using thiolate molecules designed for the desired protein coupling. Rather than the two-stage thiol linkage for protein immobilization, in our work, we examined the peptide-based linkage of the fusion enzyme. It should be pointed out that the position of the GBP insertion, at the N-terminus of AP, is opposite to the active site of the enzyme (as depicted in the inset of Fig. 4a) .",

Using either the AP alone or the 5GBP1-AP fusion, we studied to see if there was any effect of the immobilization protocol on the efficiency of adsorption and in the enzyme activity. The AFM images (Fig. 5b-e) show that both the wild-type and the hybrid construct bind to the gold regions of the patterned surface. However, the molecular packing is denser (high number density of enzyme immobilized) and more homogenous in the case of 5GBP1-AP (Fig. 5b vs. d) compared to the wild-type AP.

The prepared solution, incubated at room temperature, was assayed to quantify the enzymatic activity (see Materials and Methods Section) which was assessed under several different conditions. First, we estimated how much of the free enzyme in solution was transferred to the non-patterned gold surface. To assess this, we calculated the percentage of retained enzymatic activity by taking the ratio of the activity on the surface to that in the solution. We found that, when immobilized, only 2% (AE0.4) of wild-type AP activity was transferable onto non-patterned gold surface, whereas in case of 5GBP1-AP, transferable activity to the surface was 66% (AE0.6). The enzymatic activities obtained from both the non-patterned and the micro-patterned substrates were normalized by the corresponding surface area of the substrate available for binding (Fig. 6 ). This yielded a value (in mmol/min/mm 2 ) of $1.8 times higher for 5GBP1-AP as compared to the wildtype AP even on the non-patterned surfaces. This result also supports our earlier findings discussed above in reference to the AFM (Fig. 3) and SPR (Fig. 4) analyses in which higher and more homogenous coverage of 5GBP1-AP were observed compared to a lower coverage and non-homogenous immobilization of the wild-type AP. Similar to above, we also investigated the enzyme activity on the micro-patterned-substrates (Fig. 5) . In general, one observes an increase in the enzymatic activity of both the wild-type and fusion enzymes when targeted immobilized on the micro-patterned surfaces (Fig. 6) . The increase, however, was more prominent in the fusion protein with the GBP linker than when this linker was absent. In fact, the immobilization of the AP enzyme with GBP linker on the patterned surface resulted in three times higher enzymatic activity compared to the wild-type AP on the non-patterned substrate. Here, the double-advantage of using genetically engineered peptide for inorganics (GEPI) as the fusion linker as well as the effect of assembly in a confined area as a result of patterning was effective simultaneously to result in enhanced performance of the enzyme. While a GEPI allows the control of immobilization of the enzyme relative to the substrate, the high number density of packing possibly increases the folding stability of the protein (Zhou and Dill, 2001) .",

Various residues or domains of a given protein may interact with a given solid. These interactions are often non-specific and result in protein adsorption with loss of function as well as a loss of long-term stability (Zhang and Cass, 2001) . As schematically shown in the inset of Figure 4a , non-specific binding of AP may lead to the blocking of the active site of the enzyme which, in turn, may cause a loss of AP activity. In this context, the GBP1 linkage provides an oriented selfimmobilization of the enzyme with retained activity, as demonstrated here. Our results also show that enzymatic activity per unit area can be enhanced by directing the fusion construct on to spatial locations on a micro-patterned surface via directed assembly using the inorganic-binding peptide. Here, it may be suggested that directed assembly provides the self-localization of the molecular construct on a confined surface leading to a higher number of protein adsorption per unit surface area. Therefore, the inorganic binding peptide, that is, GBP1, not only provides specific adsorption onto gold substrate but it also, through its genetic fusion, allows oriented immobilization of enzyme leaving its catalytic site available to carry out the reactions relatively freely. The molecular platform used here can be utilized successfully for self-immobilization of enzymes in their biologically active state on any solid materials (silica, graphite, etc.) using the appropriate GEPI linker specific to that substrate, for example, silica binding peptide for silica surface, graphite-binding peptide for graphite, and gold binding peptide for gold surface.",

Therefore, it appears that the enzyme does lose its activity in the hybrid form. However, this should not necessarily be a general trend for all enzymes. In the present work, we prepared the hybrid construct by fusing the gold binding peptide on to the N-terminus of the AP which may not be the ideal site for fusion. We think, therefore, that to obtain the optimum enzymatic performance, one may need to perform a genetic search for a permissive site (Manoil and Traxler, 2000) . The knowledge of the permissive site, therefore, would provide the position for genetic fusion of the inorganic-binding peptide on to the molecule with the highest retained enzymatic activity while Figure 6 . The calculated AP activities per unit area for AP and 5GBP1-AP corresponding to self-assembly (SA) of each enzyme on the non-patterned (NP) and micro-patterned (mP) gold substrates. The AP activity per unit area for both enzymes was obtained by normalizing the activity of enzyme by the corresponding surface area available (22.4 \u00c2 10 6 and 64.0 \u00c2 10 6 mm 2 for micro-patterned and non-patterned, respectively). also allowing solid binding functionality of the fusion. Furthermore, many proteins do bind to gold surface nonspecifically; therefore other solids, most notably, silica, may be a better substrate for enzyme immobilization through inorganic silica-binding peptide (Kacar et al., 2009) . Finally, the possible ''confinement effect'' observed here on the patterned surface caused higher enzyme activity because of the higher number of ''correctly'' immobilized and homogeneously distributed enzymes in a confined space. This may be due to the limited surface area available for enzyme immobilization for a given concentration from the solution. While the inorganic binding activity of the fused GEPI allows solid binding and proper display (orientation) of the enzyme on the solid surface, the area confinement may also increase the high density assembly and, therefore, the activity of the enzyme. Therefore, it may be possible to observe the same effect when hybrid enzymes are immobilized on nanoparticles of specific size and morphology (limiting surface and controlling orientation). These approaches will undoubtedly be explored by us and, possibly, by others in the near future.",

            "text": "We presented here the utilization of inorganic binding peptides as molecular linkers for the immobilization of enzymes on solid materials. To prove the concept, we used cell surface display-selected gold binding peptide (GBP1) to self-immobilize AP on a gold surface. The enzyme genetically fused to multiple repeats (n \u00bc 5, 6, 7, 9) of GBP1 were expressed in E. coli cells. The bi-functional activity of the construct, that is, both the gold binding and phosphatase activities, was conserved as demonstrated by spectroscopic and biochemical assays. The hybrid enzyme construct that displayed the highest bi-functional activity was selected for self-immobilization experiments. Both spectroscopic and imaging assays showed that gold-specific linkage provided by GBP1 resulted in higher enzymatic activity compared to the wild-type AP. GBP1 mediated AP immobilization, therefore, provided easier access of the enzyme's active site to the surrounding aqueous media. We also showed that mCP fabricated micro-patterned substrates can be used to increase the number density of the self-immobilized enzymes by providing targeted assembly through a guidance during the assembly process. The consequence of the targeted immobilization of the genetically linked GBP1 is a simultaneous effect of directed self-assembly and higher AP activity per area compared to the wild-type. The new directed immobilization process is simple and takes place in aqueous environment requiring no synthetic linkers or special solutions. Self-assembly of the inorganic binding peptide-linked enzyme on the surface is completed fairly rapidly, that is, within hours. Our method is universal and could be extendable to any solid surface such as platinum, graphite, and silica with the use of appropriate inorganicbinding peptides. Although we show here the workings of a gold substrate, the method may be applicable in multimaterial patterned functional platforms (Tamerler et al., 2006a) that are addressed through specific inorganicbinding peptide tags, efficient and utilizable for a wide range of applications in bionanotechnology.",
