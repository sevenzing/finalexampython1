            "text": "The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has emerged as a public health emergency. All nations are seriously challenged as the virus spreads rapidly across the globe with no regard for borders. The primary management of IBD involves treating uncontrolled inflammation with most patients requiring immunebased therapies. However, these therapies may weaken the immune system and potentially place IBD patients at increased risk of infections and infectious complications including those from COVID-19. Aim: To summarise the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, review unique concerns regarding IBD management and infection risk during the pandemic and assess COVID-19 management options and drug interactions in the IBD population. Methods: A literature review on IBD, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 was undertaken and relevant literature was summarised and critically examined. Results: IBD patients do not appear to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there is no evidence of an association between IBD therapies and increased risk of COVID-19. IBD medication adherence should be encouraged to prevent disease flare but where possible high-dose systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Patients should exercise social distancing, optimise co-morbidities and be up to date with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. If a patient develops COVID-19, immune suppressing medications should be withheld until infection resolution and if trial medications for COVID-19 are being considered, potential drug interactions should be checked. Conclusion: IBD patient management presents a challenge in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus should remain on keeping bowel inflammation controlled and encouraging medication adherence.",

In addition, if an IBD patient develops COVID- 19, there is a lack of guidance on medication management and concern regarding drug interactions if trial medications are utilised to treat Therefore the aim of this review is to summarise the evidence and discuss in detail the data regarding the risks of developing COVID-19, strategies that can be implemented to reduce these risks and issues surrounding the treatment of COVID-19, including potential drug interactions and IBD medication management, in the IBD patient cohort.",

They are the largest known RNA viruses, ranging from 26 to32 kilobases in size. 7 They are named after their appearance under electron micros- Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 9 These viruses are all known to cause respiratory symptoms ranging broadly in severity, both between the different viruses and in different hosts infected with the same virus. Most spread easily and result in relatively mild illness in immunocompetent patients, with certain strains being responsible for almost 30% of the common cold. 10 Other coronaviruses (CoVs), including the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, have previously emerged as epidemics with significant mortality and socioeconomic impact. Compared to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV causes a much more severe illness, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of up to 30%, but appears to have a lower person-to-person transmission, limiting its global impact. 5 There are still new cases of MERS being reported today. 11 Similarly, the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003 had a high CFR (9.6%), but its reduced infectivity compared with SARS-CoV-2 lessened its overall impact. 12 This outbreak appears to have been contained. 12 SARS-CoV-2 is the first pandemic coronavirus. Therefore, it poses a threat of uncertain dimensions and represents uncharted territory for the public and global healthcare systems alike. 2,3",

ACE2 are found in multiple organs and are highly expressed in lung AT2 cells, enterocytes of the small intestine and colon. 22, 23 Once the virus is attached to ACE2 it uses the host serine protease TMPRSS2 for S priming allowing fusion of viral and cellular membranes and viral entry into the cell. 21 Once a person develops initial symptoms of COVID-19, respiratory viral shedding occurs for a median of 20 days in survivors and is sustained until death in nonsurvivors. 24 Of note, prolonged shedding has been demonstrated with other coronaviruses in immunocompromised patients 25 and in immunocompromised animals with MERS-CoV. 25 27 Asymptomatic people are also potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 as transmission may occur in the pre-clinical period (2-14 days) or from an oligosymptomatic individual. 27, 28 Furthermore the virus has been detected in up to 50% of stool specimens and can remain positive for viral RNA following negative respiratory samples in more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 patients. 19, 22, 29 These characteristics may have implications regarding isolation and decision-making for IBD patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 although there are no evidence-based guidelines on this currently.",

Reassuringly, the risk of severe respiratory tract infections, severe infections in general or opportunistic infections does not appear to be increased in long-term follow-up studies of ustekinumab in both IBD and psoriasis. [80] [81] [82] Similar data have also been reported for vedolizumab. [83] [84] [85] [86] There is a theoretical concern of an increased risk of respiratory infections, and hence COVID-19, with vedolizumab treatment as vedolizumab binds the T-cell integrin receptor \u03b1 4 \u03b2 7, inhibiting its binding to MADCAM1 present on the small intestinal endothelium and vasculature. These receptors are also expressed in the T cells occupying the nares, although to a far lesser extent when compared to the intestine. 87 Interestingly, baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor used in rheumatoid arthritis, has a potential therapeutic role in the management of SARS-CoV-2 through both its anti-inflammatory action and Numbassociated kinase (NAK) inhibition. Tofacitinib has no affinity for this particular kinase. NAKs are involved in the function of clathrin, which mediates endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 into cells resulting in infection. 94 Due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the JAK inhibitors, it has also been speculated that they may be able to combat the elevated levels of cytokines observed in COVID-19 which may potentially further decrease the severity of the infection. 94",

Care with drugs increasing QT interval or in patients with pre-existing risk factors.(Continues) there are no therapeutic options approved for the treatment of coronaviruses. Management of COVID-19 predominantly focuses on supportive care and treating secondary complications. The highly pathogenic nature of COVID-19 and the need to reduce burden on the health care systems worldwide has encouraged clinicians to examine all possible treatment options. WHO has created a master protocol for a multicentre, adaptive, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of investigative therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. 101 There are many drug trials currently occurring. Evidence behind some of these trials is discussed and possible drug interactions with IBD medications and the most commonly cited experimental COVID-19",

Despite this, global registries and reports are reassuring and there does not appear to be a signal that IBD patients are at greater risk or severe COVID-19 compared to the general population. These guidelines summarise the treatment approach to IBD patients in the current climate and emphasises the importance of avoiding corticosteroids and maintaining remission by encouraging compliance with patients' usual maintenance medications. If an IBD patient does develop COVID-19, immunosuppressive medications should be withheld where possible until infection resolution and if a medication trial is being considered and patients remain on IBD medications, interactions with current IBD medications should be evaluated.",
