Sars-Cov2, currently, limited clinical cancer-specific data are available and information is evolving. 67 In this regard, on 12 th March 2020, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) developed a statement with Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the issues and challenges they see emerging while caring for patients with cancer in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. 1 Also in Italy (the most involved country with infected Sars-Cov2 patients and deaths related to COVID19) Italian Ministry of Health has published guidance (in Italian) specific to cancer. 68 According to these guidelines and to present literature, there is no specific evidence of COVID-19 infection complications associated with any systemic cancer therapy regimen. 67 In a prospective cohort of 1571 patients with COVID-19, 18 of which had a prior history of cancer, Liang et al.found that patients with a history of cancer had a higher incidence of severe events.69 However, the same author specified that these 18 patients represent a heterogeneous group and are not an ideal representation of the entire population of patients with cancer.68,70 In oncodermatology two main categories of therapy are currently used: target therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Regarding target therapies. It is known that one of the most serious event that can lead patients to a respiratory failure and death, is the onset of an exacerbated immune response in COVID-19-infected pneumonia with severe immune abnormalities and risk of cytokine release syndrome,70 closely associated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6). 71,72 This finding justified the rationale of the current use of anti-IL6 (e.g. tocilizumab) treatment in severe COVID19 patients with severe respiratory failure. For this reason, in the context of severe COVID19 infection, stopping and reducing the exacerbated immune response plays a pivotal role.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "In melanoma target therapy(i.e. anti-BRAF),Xu et al.  reported that these treatments can alter the immunosuppressive cytokine milieu of tumor cells and enhance infiltration of immune effector cells; indeed BRAF inhibition may decrease the levels of immunomodulatory cytokines IL-10, VEGF and IL-6, showing increased expression of T cell exhaustion markers like TIM3 and PD-1, allowing tumor cells to escape immune detection.73 This on one hand translates into a greater infectious risk and a greater viral load in the hosts, on the other the i.e.cytokine storm, ARDS). However, there are currently no certain data to confirm this assertion. Therefore, the important parameters regarding optimizing dose, sequence, and timing of targeted therapy should be considered in order to maximize the overall antitumor efficacy and minimize the toxicity profiles.73", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "EGFR monoclonal antibodies offer the potential to improve outcomes in invasive NMSC. In a metanalysis Qi et al. revealed an increase in the risk of infection following therapy with HER family-directed antibodies.80 This is determined by the suppression of Toll-Like Receptors: an important class of immune-sensors, expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells, allowing the synthesis of protective antimicrobial molecules such as interferon. These receptors require tyrosine phosphorylation to recruit adaptor proteins, and this process depends on EGFR activation.80 Dysregulated EGFR function, as during anti-EGFR therapy, of the normal respiratory epithelium and dendritic cells could thus result in an increased risk of severe infection(including viral infections).80 Therefore, in the light of the coronavirus pandemic, special attention should be paid to this class of patients, as they are considered to be at greater risk of contagion. There are no data, however, on a possible drug-related exacerbated immune response.In the field of cutaneous lymphoma and leukemia,we refer to what reported in the ASCO FAQs, highlighting how currently no specific recommendation can be made (except for stem cell transplantation) for delay in therapy or choosing alternate therapy in the context of COVID-19", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "immunosuppressant and oncologic agents for dermatologic treatments do not require suspension of treatment and do not require special measures, if not those commonly observed.

While, for patients on systemic immunosuppressive agents who have tested positive for COVID-19 or exhibit signs/symptoms of COVID-19, the AAD generally recommend to discontinue or postpone the systemic immunosuppressive agents until the patient recovers from COVID-19. In any case AAD guidelines generally advice for patients being considered/planning for systemic immunosuppressive agents to consider always the risk vs. benefits on a case-by case basis. The Australian/New Zealand consensus statement highlights that in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease, allimmunomodulators used for skin diseases should be immediately withheld, with the possible exception of systemic corticosteroid therapy, which needs to be weaned.11 In patients who develop symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, but COVID-19 is not yet confirmed, consider dose reduction or temporarily cessation for 1-2 weeks. In otherwise well patients, immunomodulators and biologics should be continued.11 Finally, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 169 guidelines mainly refer to the BAD guidelines.In this regard, a good starting point to evaluate immunobiologic and immunosuppressants safety during the daily clinical practice at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic would be the review of the mechanism of action and the evidence from previous studies for each category of drugs .
