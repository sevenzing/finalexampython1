            "text": "We read with interest the article by Lorenzo et al 1 of conjunctivitis and COVID-19: a meta-analysis. We appreciate the article's suggestions on protection in ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment but believe that the data and conclusions in meta-analysis need further study, the reasons are as follows: First, the original meta-analysis included three studies 2-4 one of which the data processing of Wu et al 2 may not be consistent with the original text. Wu et al 2 found conjunctivitis in 12 of the 38 patients. Among these 12 patients, there were four cases judged as moderate, two cases judged as severe, and six cases judged as critical. Therefore, according to the guideline of PC-NCP, 5 the proportion of severe COVID-19 should be 8 of 15 and that of not severe COVID-19 should be 4 of 23. However, the data of this meta-analysis are 2 of 15 and 1 of 23, respectively. Second, in a study by Li et al, 3 there is a great difference between the severe and not severe sample sizes, which is larger than that in the other two included studies. The probability of conjunctivitis in patients with not severe COVID-19 was 4 of 173, and the severe COVID-19 is 5 of 926. The original analysis concluded that patients with severe COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from conjunctivitis while excluding Li et al. Sensitivity analysis in large sample studies concluded that patients with not severe COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from conjunctivitis. So we can find that the conclusion is completely opposite after removing this study. COVID-19 patients may have conjunctivitis, and even the first symptom of some cases is conjunctivitis. 6-8 However, it is not clear whether the onset of conjunctivitis is different for COVID-19 patients with different severe conditions. Based on the above thinking, we searched PubMed and CNKI for articles on COVID-19 and conjunctivitis with the words of COVID-19, 2019-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and conjunctivitis. The severity of COVID-19 was distinguished according to PC-NCP guidelines, the incidence of conjunctivitis in patients with severe and not severe COVID-19 was included. A total of 62 studies were searched, 37 studies were read in full after duplication, and 4 studies were included (Figure 1). 2,4,9,10 Meta-analysis showed that the probability of conjunctivitis (odds ratio = \u22120.84; 95% confidence interval, [\u2212 1.66, \u2212 0.01]; P = .05) between severe patients and not severe patients was statistically significant, not severe COVID-19 patients seem to be more likely to develop conjunctivitis. It can be seen that the results of our meta-analysis are not consistent with those of the original meta-analysis.",

            "text": "tions on protection in ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment but believe that the data and conclusions in meta-analysis need further study, the reasons are as follows: First, the original meta-analysis included three studies 2-4 one of which the data processing of Wu et al 2 may not be consistent with the original text. Wu et al 2 found conjunctivitis in 12 of the 38 patients. Among these 12 patients, there were four cases judged as moderate, two cases judged as severe, and six cases judged as critical. Therefore, according to the guideline of PC-NCP, 5 the proportion of severe COVID-19 should be 8 of 15 and that of not severe COVID-19 should be 4 of 23. However, the data of this meta-analysis are 2 of 15 and 1 of 23, respectively. Second, in a study by Li et al, 3 there is a great difference between the severe and not severe sample sizes, which is larger than that in the other two included studies. The probability of conjunctivitis in patients with not severe COVID-19 was 4 of 173, and the severe COVID-19 is 5 of 926. The original analysis concluded that patients with severe COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from conjunctivitis while excluding Li et al. Sensitivity analysis in large sample studies concluded that patients with not severe COVID-19 are more likely to suffer from conjunctivitis. So we can find that the conclusion is completely opposite after removing this study. COVID-19 patients may have conjunctivitis, and even the first symptom of some cases is conjunctivitis. 6-8 However, it is not clear whether the onset of conjunctivitis is different for COVID-19 patients with different severe conditions. Based on the above thinking, we searched PubMed and CNKI for articles on COVID-19 and conjunctivitis with the words of COVID-19, 2019-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and conjunctivitis. The severity of COVID-19 was distinguished according to PC-NCP guidelines, the incidence of conjunctivitis in patients with severe and not severe COVID-19 was included. A total of 62 studies were searched, 37 studies were read in full after duplication, and 4 studies were included (Figure 1). 2,4,9,10 Meta-analysis showed that the probability of conjunctivitis (odds ratio = \u22120.84; 95% confidence interval, [\u2212 1.66, \u2212 0.01]; P = .05) between severe patients and not severe patients was statistically significant, not severe COVID-19 patients seem to be more likely to develop conjunctivitis. It can be seen that the results of our meta-analysis are not consistent with those of the original meta-analysis.",
