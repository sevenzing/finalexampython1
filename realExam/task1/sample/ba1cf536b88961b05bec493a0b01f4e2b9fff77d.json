As mentioned above, there are many options for workouts that require no equipment and 87 limited space including aerobics or dancing with or without workout videos, yoga, mat pilates, sit-ups, 88 and bodyweight training (squats, burpees, push-ups and mountain climber). Encourage patients to get 89 creative and choose exercises that target different areas of the body for a full-body workout (SeeFigure 901). Use bottles or cans for weights, dish towels for resistance training with a family member, or a sturdy 91 chair for step-ups. For an easy to remember routine, suggest performing five exercises, doing each for a 92 minute, then repeating the circuit three to five times. Circuit training like this provides cardiovascular as 93 4 well as strength benefits by going from one exercise to another with minimal rest. There are some 94 inexpensive pieces of home gym equipment that can supplement a fitness routine and include 95 resistance bands, a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells which can provide good resistance training and not a time to over-exercise. Novices and advanced athletes should protect their health and do 98 enough to maintain physical and mental well-being. In addition, safeguard the body from injury during 99 this time, as it will be difficult to get the appropriate care needed. People with asthma may need to 100 check in via telemedicine with their healthcare provider to ensure they are healthy enough to exercise, 101 to review how to use their medication, and/or to refill prescriptions that are expired-19, outdoor activities can be done safely if patients are adhering to social distancing rules.",

I am not just talking about road cyclists, but also people on cruiser 136 bikes, mountain bikes, etc. It is actually good to see so many people out riding with their kids, who are using this time of quarantine to initiate an exercise program, the goal should be to 139 keep these patients exercising once life returns to \"normal\". In order to do this, patients should aim to 140 do some form of exercise daily to create a habit, which generally takes about 10 weeks.(7)In addition, 141 patients should plan to exercise at the time of day they would exercise under traditional circumstances.142All patients should be encouraged to use wearable technology that can be uploaded to sites like Strava 143 or Garmin Connect so they can track their own progress and connect with friends on these apps.144 145 Where do we go from here? 146 Healthcare providers have an opportunity to change the way they discuss health and fitness with their 147 patients. Instead of providing generic recommendations to exercise five days a week for at least 30 148 minutes, providers can review individual health data and develop a personalized exercise regimen based 149 on feedback from fitness apps and wearable devices. This tailored regimen can be monitored in real 150 time, giving caregivers unrestricted access into the everyday activities of patients that were previously 151 inaccessible, if the patient so desires. It is an opportunity for healthcare providers to observe normal vs. 152 abnormal ebbs and flows in a patient's training which could be an indicator of an impending injury, 153 overtraining, or a more serious condition. Additionally, healthcare providers should ask their patients 154 how exercising made them feel physically and if it had any impact on their breathing. This provides an 155 opportunity to review pre-exercise treatment with short-acting beta-agonists, are using exercise to manage the stress of the pandemic, there are many people who are 160 managing their stress with food. Overeating and binge-eating can lead to regret, physical discomfort, 161 and weight gain. It is important for providers to recognize this and discuss any lapses in weight loss 162 efforts. Acknowledging the difficult emotions they may have felt during the pandemic that led to the 163 weight gain and providing encouragement that they can start fresh now without judgment may help 164 patients reestablish their pre-pandemic eating patterns. 165 166 Wellness for the allergy and immunology physician is paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic, 167 because there is an increase in emotional stress and uncertainty regarding many issues, including family, 168 financial, and medical practice. Physicians must address their own wellness, including performing 169 physical and exercise activities utilizing the above recommendations.",
