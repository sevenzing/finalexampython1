Firstly, a literature survey is done on COVID-19 highlighting a number of factors including its origin, its similarity with previous coronaviruses, its transmission capacity, its symptoms, etc. Secondly, data analytics is applied on a dataset of Johns Hopkins University to find out the spread of the viral infection. It is shown here that although the disease started in China in December 2019, the highest number of confirmed cases up to 04 June 2020 is in the USA. Thirdly, the worldwide increase in the number of confirmed cases over time is modelled here using a polynomial regression algorithm with degree 2. Fourthly, classification algorithms are applied on a dataset of 5644 samples provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein of Brazil in order to diagnose COVID-19. It is shown here that multilayer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost and logistic regression can classify COVID-19 patients at an accuracy above 91 percent. Finally, a discussion is presented on the potential applications of data analytics in several important factors of COVID-19.",

            "text": "A life threatening infectious coronavirus [1] started from Wuhan of China in December 2019. As of 04 June 2020, the disease has officially spread to 213 countries and territories infecting a total of 6,632,985 people causing a death of 391,136. The patients affected by this coronavirus show symptoms of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has termed this particular virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated disease as COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Recently, the WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. One of the similar coronaviruses reported in the last two decades is the outbreak of Severe Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS) was noted in the swine industry in 2017. These diseases originated from bats and they are pathogenic to humans or livestock [7] [8] [9] [10] . Some of the main symptoms of this disease are the development of fever, cough, and respiratory problems including shortness of breath. According to WHO, the incubation period of this virus in most cases vary from 2 to 10 days. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for this disease, for example there is no vaccine for prevention of this disease. There is no specific antiviral treatment as well. The doctors help the patients to manage the symptoms. In many cases, the patients may develop pneumonia and experience failure of multiple organs leading to possible death. The COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets from the patients. In other words, the spread is severe when the infected patients cough or sneeze [10] . However, the spread can be minimized to some extent by taking hygiene measure including careful handwashing. Moreover, early detection of this disease can help in the containment of the virus. Because of the life threatening nature and no cure of COVID-19, significant research interest has been seen in this field since early January 2020. It is expected that data analytics can play an important role in investigating the salient features of COVID-19 and eventually find a vaccine for it. Therefore, this paper focuses on the application of data analytics on COVID-19. The contributions of this paper are summarized below:",

In the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, work-related transmission has been an important factor, and the infection may have spread greatly among health care workers, transport workers, services and sales workers [2] . The transmission of COVID-19 is estimated by the collection and analyzation of spatiotemporal data [3] . In this regard, the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is estimated using the individual case reports of 140 infected persons. With the consideration of case reports, the estimates of the epidemiology parameters, human travel data and infection data, the basic reproductive number is found to be in between 4.7 to 6.6 [3] . There may be underreporting cases of coronavirus during the period of 1 to 15 January 2020 [4] . The cumulative incidence of 5502 cases in China is estimated with a confidence interval of 95% [5] . The epidemic of COVID-19 may spread due to some untraced exposures other than the exposure in seafood marker in China [5] . Some patients do not show symptoms, while others have different types of symptoms [6] . Some patients have different symptoms such as pneumonia with problem identified in CT scan, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia, etc. [6] . There may be undetected internationally imported cases too [7] . A transmission model in [8] estimated the basic reproductive number to be 3.11.",

The increasing genetic diversity of this disease is indicated by phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood mapping analyses of the genome sequences [9] . The SARS and MERS diseases are caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, respectively. SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 caused 8000 cases with 774 deaths in 37 countries. On the other hand, MERS outbreak in 2012 caused 2494 cases with 858 deaths in 27 countries over the world [9] . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are infectious disease zoonotic in origin that means these are spread from animal to human. Bats are regarded as the animal host source, while palm civets and camels are the intermediate means between bats and animals for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 may be originated from bats, but the intermediate carrier between bats to humans is yet to be cleared [9] . The concepts of the pathology and pathogenesis used for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are now applied to find the characteristics of COVID-19 [10] . COVID-19 is a class of \u03b2-coronavirus genus, having a 79.0% and a 51.8% nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [10] . This virus has 96% similarity when compared with a bat coronavirus in terms of genome [9] [10] . COVID-19 is a recombinant virus which may be a homologous recombination of a bat coronavirus and another coronavirus whose origin is not known [11] . Moreover, COVID-19 has some genetic similarity with bat coronavirus and codon usage bias with snake or snake's translation machinery [11] . Four structural proteins are essential for the formation of coronavirus during virion assembly [12] .",

In order to prevent any future outbreak of COVID-19, it is important to find the exact origin and the intermediate hosts of SARS-COV-2 [14] . It is found that the codon usage pattern of SARS-COV-2 is unique. When the codon usage of different viruses including SARS-CoV are taken into consideration, the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 is very much different from that of humans. For the case of SARS-CoV-2, the codons are replaced by ones with lower human-preference. Because of this unique codon usage pattern, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 was probably formed by evolving in an uncommon intermediate host for a long time. The codon biases are generated due to the evolution of genome composition [14] .",

The data related to clinical records, lab tests, and chest CT scans of those women are studied. According to the study [16] , as of 4 February 2020, seven patients had fever, four had cough, three had myalgia, two had sore throat, two had malaise and two had fetal distress, five had lymphopenia, three had increased aminotransferase concentrations, and no one died. Furthermore, the study reports that no neonatal asphyxia was observed in 9 newborn babies. Results of these nine patients indicate that COVID-19 may not cause intrauterine fetal infections at pregnancy. However, the small sample size of nine patients is not good enough to come to a definite conclusion. The interaction between the human innate immune system and COVID-19 is studied in [17] to understand the virus induced inflammation of lung tissues. The results show that the infection can be controlled by humoral immunity, targeted immunotherapy can be useful [17] .

The authors in [22] also provide some visualization of this epidemic up to 16 February 2020. In this work, we analyze the dataset of 04 June 2020 death rate can be obtained in two ways. When the number of deaths is divided by the number of confirmed cases then death rate is 5.90%, however when number of deaths is divided by the number of closed cases (death + recovered) then death rate is 11.99%. For the rest of this paper, death rate will only be considered in terms of number of deaths over number of confirmed cases. mortality rate still has affected much more people than any of the epidemics mentioned in Table   2 . Fig. 3 shows the plots of death rate and recover rate across the globe for a time span ranging from 22 January 2020 to 04 June 2020. In this case, recovery/death rate is defined as the ratio of recovery/death to confirmed cases. It can be seen that the recovery rate has significantly increased from January to first week of March, however, it decreased from second week of March to first week of April 2020. The recovery rate has increased since early April 2020 which indicates that the number of active cases has reduced as many active patients have recovered. On the other hand, the death rate has increased from below 3% in Mid-February 2020 to around 6.0% in June 2020. Fig. 4 presents Graph showing the death cases, recovered and active cases over time in the world. It can be seen from Fig. 4 (a) that the death case has a significantly sharp increment since the first week of March 2020. From Fig. 4(b) it can be seen that the recovery cases have been steady with linear increment over time, but the active cases have experienced sharp increase after first week of March 2020. Fig. 5 illustrates the number of currently active cases of COVID-19. Fig. 5(a) is a pie chart indicating that the percentage of active cases in the world is currently 42.20% of the total confirmed cases. At the same time the recovered cases is 51.90% of the total confirmed cases. Fig. 5 ",

This kind of warning system can help to detect cases of COVID-19 and reduce the number of undetected cases. For this, the symptoms of previous patients have to be stored in a repository. For example, the images of CT scans of normal people and coronavirus affected patients can be stored for training the system, while any new patient's CT scan image can be compared with the training images to find the similarity score. The main features of these patients can be found out from the application of machine learning. With the increase in the number of patient data, the training dataset will increase making the system's prediction work better. In addition to the above issues, research is required on the possible effect of the coronavirus in developing countries that are highly populated but have poor health care systems. In these countries many people are not accustomed to maintaining personal hygiene appropriately. Lack of proper education and awareness is also a big problem. Lack of proper testing kits means many are not tested. Moreover, there is lack of good lab facilities, skill personnel resulting in possible error in processing and analysis. So, many patients may remain undetected. Therefore, it is important to find an inexpensive and cheap artificial intelligent system for data driven diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in these countries.",

From Fig. 6(a), it is observed that since early March 2020, the number of confirmed cases and number of deaths in China have become somewhat stable, while the number of recovered patients has increased greatly. This indicates the success of China in overcoming the spread of the virus. On the other hand, Fig. 6(b) reflects that the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases are increasing outside China since early March 2020. Fig. 7 presents a horizontal bar chart of confirmed/recovered/death cases in Hubei province of China, other provinces of China and the rest of the world. Most of the cases in China are in the Hubei province. The bar chart shows that the number of infections and the number of deaths in Hubei are 68135 and 4512, respectively. On the other hand, number of infections and deaths in other Chinese provinces are 16036 and 126, respectively. This indicates that China has successfully managed to stop the spread of COVID-19 from Hubei to other provinces.

There are a number of regressors in machine learning, in this paper two widely used algorithms named linear regression and polynomial algorithms are considered. Linear regression is popular for simple algorithm and for a having well-known features. Linear regression finds an equation that ensures the smallest difference among the observed sample values and the corresponding fitted sample values. Polynomial regression is a special form of regression where the relationship between independent and dependent variable are modelled as a polynomial of n-th degree in the independent variable. The regression prediction can be evaluated by a number of metrics, but we will consider one of the popular metrics known as coefficient of determination or R). This 2 R term is considered as a goodness of fit of a model and measures how good the predictions approximate or fit the actual data samples. In other words, it measures the scatter of the data points around the fitted regression line. A value of 2 1 R = means that the predictions from the regression model perfectly fit to the actual data samples. In this case, dataset [23] is used for regression where the number of days is the independent variable and the confirmed cases is the dependent variable. The regression line is plotted using the steps described in Algorithm 2 and then applying the .plt() function. Recently there has been a number of research papers that consider regression for predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, for example the work in [30] develops a regression model for the case of India. In the following, regression models are used on the number of confirmed cases in the world available in the dataset [23]. The regression part version of Algorithm 2 reported in Section 4.1 is used to model the trend of the confirmed cases over time.",

Table 4 presents the predicted confirmed cases for future days with respect to 4 June 2020, the last day of the dataset.

The parameters of these classifiers can also be varied to find the best result for a particular scenario. In this case, XGBoost, MLP, KNN, LR and DT are considered as these provide more promising results than others in our experiments.",

MLP is a form of feed forward artificial neural network and composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons termed as perceptrons. In MLP algorithm, a perceptron uses an activation function which maps the weighted input of each neuron. In KNN, classification is performed by a plurality vote of the k neighbors where the output class is the one most closest to the neighbors. kNN is a non-parametric simple and versatile algorithm. Its implementation is easy, but the functioning gets slower with increase in the number of predictor variables. LR functions according to the concept of probability. LR is a form of classification algorithm where the observations are assigned to discrete classes with a logistic sigmoid function. This algorithm can be of three different types: binomial, multinomial and ordinal. In DT classifier, data are continuously split into subsets, then split into even smaller subsets, and this process continues until the data within the subsets become near homogenous. The structure of a DT is similar to flow-chart where each non-leaf nodes represent a test on an attribute, a branch represents the outcome of a test and each terminal node represent a class label. Moreover, DT algorithm is easy to interpret and performs well with large datasets.For our experiments, the steps in Algorithm 2 of Section 4.1 that are for classifiers and for cross validation are considered. In this case a 20 fold cross validation is performed to split the dataset into training and testing portions. These performance of the classifiers are measures in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)",

Since early March 2020, the situation in China has improved due to a number of steps taken including strict quarantine measures and travel bans. Currently there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, the existing treatments are only for the symptoms. Hence, investigation into the pathogenesis of this infection is important for finding its appropriate treatment. It is shown here that the current increase in the number of confirmed cases over time can be modelled by polynomial regression of degree 2. However, new models have to be developed to reliably predict the future number of confirmed cases considering continuation and relaxation of lockdowns and other aspects. It is also shown in this work, that MLP, XGBoost and LR can reliably classify COVID-19 patients found in a dataset of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. However, the effectiveness of the classifiers should be validated on a more reliable and larger dataset. With the use of machine learning and with the availability of data on important features, automatic predictions can be made on the possibility of a suspected person to have COVID-19. In future it is believed that different types of coronavirus outbreaks will continue originating from animals for example bats. Hence continuous research is required in the investigation of current and any future coronaviruses.",

In other words, any classification test with MLP for this dataset has 93.13% probability to be correct. Table 6 also shows that MLP has the highest AUC value 96.70%. This means that the classifier can successfully separate the positive and negative classes of the COVID-19 suspected patients with 96.70% probability. In addition, MLP has the highest values of precision, recall and F1 score, all being 93%. Note that the 93% recall value of MLP means that the classifier identifies patients having the disease at 93% accuracy. In other words, if a patient is diagnosed as negative (normal) there is only 7% chance that the test is inaccurate.
