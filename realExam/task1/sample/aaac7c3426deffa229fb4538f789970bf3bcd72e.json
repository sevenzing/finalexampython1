Acute tuberculous pneumonia 37 (TP) is similar to typical bacterial pneumonia, and it is one of the causes of childhood illness 38 [2]. 39 3 Acute TP generally refers to the clinical manifestations of community-acquired pneumo-40 nia (CAP), but the pathogen is M. tuberculosis instead of non-tuberculous bacteria or viruses 41 [3]. TP is contagious: coughing, sneezing, laughing, and even speaking can produce droplet 42 nuclei containing M. tuberculosis. Transmission occurs when a person inhales the droplet nu-43 clei [4]. 44 In developing countries, M. tuberculosis is a main pathogen that cause CAP. A systemat-45 ic review found that over 10% of patients with CAP in Asia were caused by M. tuberculosis 46 [5].

Jose Moreira pointed out that 59.3% of patients with TP have at 66 least one complication; the most common ones are AIDS and diabetes [7]. 67 1.2 Pathogenesis 68 Previous studies have tried to explain the pathogenesis of acute TP. M. tuberculosis 69 propagates every 18 to 24 hours, and it is uncommon for PTB to initially manifest as acute, 70 rapidly progressive pneumonia. Septimus believed that this rapid progression may be an exu-71 dative hypersensitivity to aspirated tuberculoprotein, instead of the inflammatory response 72 caused by M. tuberculosis [8]. Rich noted that the acute pneumonia could either be caused by 73 massive M. tuberculosis infection or inhaled tuberculprotein which cause acute exudative hy-74 persensitivity. A study showed that in human TB, fresh pneumonia exudates were found 75 around caseous lesions with little or no acid-fast bacilli (AFB) [14]. As early as 1931, Larson 76 and Long injected tuberculin into the trachea of normal and TB guinea pigs respectively, con-77 firming the hypersensitivity associated tuberculoproteins [15]. 78 Imaging examination showed that TP was characterized by parenchymal lesions in the 79 lung area around the affected bronchi. Bacteria and caseous substance penetrated into the pe-80 riphery through these affected bronchial fistulas. TP presents a poor clinical inflammatory re-81 sponse that is different from the classic caseous pneumonia [16]. Clinically, dry irritating 82 cough usually occurred a few days before fever and lung involvement, and appeared after the 83 complete formation of fistula [17]. 84 After the formation of TP, the outcome depends on the amount of bacteria in the caseous 85 substance inhaled into the lungs from the lymph nodes. If there is little or no bacteria in the 86 consolidation area, pneumonia will be relieved, which is previously called \"epituberculosis\" 87 102 manifestations of pneumonia are often more prominent.

Therefore, 108 timely and accurate screening of TP will help to reduce the transmission of TB. Serologic test: Leukocytosis was observed in only 35.6% of the TP patients [7]. The 126 white blood cell count rarely exceeds 15000/cu mm [8, 9]. Some potential biomarkers in se-127 rum have been discovered in the diagnosis of TP. Researchers have constructed TB prediction 128 model by detecting the levels of three iron biomarkers in serum (including serum iron, ferritin 129 and transferrin) that can diagnose TB well.

First-line drugs include rifampicin, streptomycin, isoniazid, etc. Second-215 line drugs include kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, ethionamide, etc. [56]. TB treatment requires a 216 combination of multiple antibiotics with a treatment cycle of 6-9 months or even 2 years. 217 However, the combination of multiple antibiotics, non-standard medication and insufficient 218 medication duration are likely to produce strains of drug resistance [57]. These strains are de-219 fined as MDR. The main drugs used to treat MDR-TB are fluoroquinolones (FQ) and lastline 220 injections (amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin). Their use may lead to the emergence of 221 extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains that developed additional resistance mechanisms to 222 FQ and aminoglycosides [58]. Therefore, the use of FQ as an empirical treatment for CAP in 223 TB endemic areas should implement short-course (5 -10 days) regimen to reduce the appear-224 ance of FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis [59]. This emphasizes the importance of rapid screening 225 for M. tuberculosis infection in CAP patients [60].

If the lesion is located 89 in middle lobe or lingula, it will cause advanced complications such as bleeding and recurrent 90 bacterial pneumonia [19] . 91 1.3 TB and pneumonia 92 The incidence of pneumonia in PTB patients is higher than that in normal groups [20] . In 93 some areas, such as Uganda, epidemiological analysis has shown that children with severe 94 pneumonia have a higher incidence of PTB, accounting for 18.9% [21] . A recent study has 95 shown that in CAP patients with streptococcus pneumoniae and M. tuberculosis coinfection, 96 pneumococcal pneumonia is likely to provide fertile ground for reactivation of latent TB [22] . 97 In patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), long-term use of medication increases the 98 risk of secondary pneumonia. In turn, secondary pneumonia significantly delays in smear 99 conversion to negative in patients with MDR-TB. This is also a cause to TB treatment failure Imaging test: Medical imaging is an indispensable test in the diagnosis of acute TP. 115 Morphological feature analysis of lesion is a pivotal basis for imaging diagnosis for acute TP. 116 The radiographic characteristic of TP is homogeneous, segmental consolidation on CXR, 117 which is interpreted by chest radiologists as bacterial pneumonia [25] . A retrospective study 118 on 59 TP patients found that pulmonary consolidation of most cases (67.8%) appeared in up-119 per lobes, with the right lobe predominate. 9 cases' pulmonary consolidation were found in 120 the middle lobe [7].",

The 236 advantage of inhalation therapy for TB is that it can deliver high concentrations of drugs to 237 the lungs, which is the main sites of M. tuberculosis infection. Inhalation therapy for TB is a 238 potentially strategy that needs to be evaluated in clinical studies [64]. There is a precedent for 239 inhalation of beclomethasone dipropionate in acute TP patients complicated with asthma [65]. 240 A recent article described the effect of intrapulmonary administration on local and systemic 241 pharmacokinetics and showed how inhaled administration achieved high levels in the lung 242 along with low levels of systemic absorption, which will help avoid toxicity [66].

Therefore, anti-inflammatory drugs should be considered 250 in treatment for TP except antibiotics that target M. tuberculosis. A study found that PTB pa-251 tients with acute renal failure who received corticosteroids had lower mortality than patients 252 without corticosteroids [71]. It may be related to the anti-inflammatory properties of gluco-corticoids and receptor agonists, such as dexamethasone and prednisone [72].

Pulmonary consolidation caused by TP can 266 cause destructive damage to lung tissue, which is typically marked by pulmonary cavity [79, 267 80]. Therefore, chronic lung damage after treatment of M. tuberculosis infection should be 268 considered [78, 81], and lung function repair should be performed to prevent M. tuberculosis 269 reinfection. 270 Studies have found that inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase may reduce lung damage in 271 people with history of tuberculosis, but it still needs to be proved by clinical trials [82]. Some 272 traditional Chinese medicines may have repairing and protecting effects on TB-induced lung 273 damage. Sinomenine, which was originally extracted from a Chinese herbal medicine-274 Sinomenium acutum, can attenuate acute lung injury by inhibiting inflammation and reducing 275 oxidative stress [83]. Radix Astragali, a traditional Chinese medicine, can protect cells and 276 tissues from oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species, and fi-Climate change, air pollution and air allergens, etc. can affect cardiopulmonary health 279 [85]. In the elderly, the increase in temperature and relative humidity are related to the decline 280 in lung function [86]. Therefore elderly patients with TP should pay attention to living in a 281 suitable environment after recovery. Pablo A Salcedo et al. used meta-analysis to quantify the 282 effect of exercise training on indices of pulmonary function in adults with chronic lung dis-283 ease, and pointed out that whole body exercise training can effectively improve lung function, 284 especially the vital capacity index [87]. Exercise can also improve the lung function of chil-285 dren with cystic fibrosis [88]. Therefore, proper exercise is indispensable after TP treatment.",

Positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET/CT), which measures pulmonary inflammation through cellular uptake of 18 F-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose, was very sensitive to detect M. tuberculosis early infection [27].is still the main laboratory test in many resource-limited settings[29]. The respiratory specimen of TP patient usually contains fewer bacteria and may require multiple samples for AFB test. The quality of microscopy diagnosis is often not guaranteed, as this test was noted to136    have poor sensitivity (between 30% and 70%)[30]. A retrospective observational study showed that 27 of 70 PTB patients (38.5%) were AFB smear-negative. These patients were more likely to be treated as non-tuberculous pneumonia and be admitted to the general ward 139 without quarantined during hospitalization [31].Using an automated screening system can improve the utility of this older diagnostic test-smear microscopy. Law has developed a computer-aided whole smear screening system, that can be used to detect AFB from respiratory specimens under general optical microscopy143 or fluorescence microscopy. So the staff workload can be reduced [32].Although there are many diagnostic methods, one of the challenges in the diagnosis of TP is to distinguish it from non-tuberculous CAP. In some areas with high TB prevalence, it is easy to misdiagnose PTB as CAP (such as community-acquired Tsukamurella pneumonia) due to similar symptoms[33]. Nonetheless, the two still have their own characteristics (Table 149 1). In the course of CAP treatment, acute TP should be considered when the patient experiences ineffective antibiotic treatment. And the patient should be screened for HIV infection shown the important clinical significance in identifying TB, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia in HIV patients [35]. PCT levels in patients with PTB were significantly lower than those non-tuberculous CAP patients [6]. PCT tests have acceptable sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing TB from bacterial pneumonia [36]. However, a pro-spective cohort study showed that using CRP and PCT to identify TB from CAP patients has limited value [35]. Moreover, CRP has high sensitivity but low specificity in diagnosis of HIV-associated TB [37]. Accordingly, CRP and PCT can be used as reference indicators for",
