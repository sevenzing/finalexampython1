Feature selection is essential in model design, because the inclusion of irrelevant features is detrimental to the understanding and performance of the model, while rejecting relevant features can be just as bad [5] . Recent times have seen the emergence of \"big\" healthcare data that increase the number of candidate features. Here, we argue that feature selection should be performed by ML algorithms, rather than humans.",

We believe that such a reductionist approach is limited in its ability to successfully predict patient outcomes. The majority of health conditions (e.g., asymptomatic, infection, or critical) do not arise from a linear interaction between isolated factors, but from non-linear interactions among a web of determinants (genetic, biological, clinical, social, etc.). Neural networks, a family of ML nonlinear models (of which deep learning is a variant), are a particularly attractive way to model this, not least because of their universal approximation property [6] .",

Another key issue, in the context of an epidemic, is the choice of \"informative\" data.

First and foremost, ML algorithms need to have access to sufficient amounts of data that closely resemble the data expected in a clinical scenario. Therefore, we encourage the healthcare community and organizations to make biomedical data public as early as possible and right from the beginning of the epidemic. The COVID-19 epidemic promotes the constitution of medical databases (e.g., COVID ICU, French corona) that will be exhaustive enough to allow ML, but they are currently not public.",
