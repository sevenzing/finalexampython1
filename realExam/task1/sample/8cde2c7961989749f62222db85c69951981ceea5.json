Our proposed strategy involves partitioning the population into smaller isolated sub-populations within which, while social distancing is practised as much as possible to reduce the contact rate, a relatively normal lifestyle is maintained.

Introduction.-In the midst of the spread of infection by the novel corona-virus, current political efforts are mainly aimed at reducing the rate of contact-based infection (by limiting social interactions and quarantining infected people, thus effectively removing them from the pool that can infect susceptibles). This is hoped to lead to an overall smaller peak in the infected fraction of the population. Typical responses by governments have started from relatively mild measures in the form of travel restrictions implemented between whole nations and shut down of major gatherings, and switched to extreme measures that limit the mobility of individuals to the confines of their homes. According to our analysis, which is based on the effect of fluctuations in the spread of infection, it is possible to propose an alternative scenario that introduces an intermediate level of restrictions and contains the spread of infection. Our scenario considers the very early stages of an epidemic when the spread is expected to grow exponentially on average. The key idea is that more stringent isolation of smaller sub-populations could make use of stochastic effects and increase the likelihood of a spontaneous end of infection chains in local communities via a process called extinction. We find that strict isolation at the level of sub-populations also has the advantage of leading to stochastic desynchronization of the epidemic bursts, such that not all sub-populations reach peak at the same time and the total peak number of infected individuals in the entire population is further reduced (see Figs. 1a and 1b) .",

Discussion.-Standard strategies to contain epidemic spreads are typically aimed at reducing b (by limiting social interactions and quarantining infected people), which leads to an overall decrease in \u03b3. While travel restrictions implemented between whole nations (and also between individual federal states) are the first large scale methods used for containment, according to the above analysis more stringent isolation of smaller subpopulations could make use of stochastic effects and increase the likelihood of a spontaneous end of infection chains in local communities. This would reduce the overall peak number of infected people (and therefore strain on the healthcare system) by an additional factor of up to I 0 /N s \u00b7 (1 \u2212 k/b) when I 0 /N s < 1, even if efforts of reducing b below k are not effective and b > k remains. One contribution comes from the communities which have no initially infected people and are now protected (I 0 /N s ), while another contribution comes from the possibility that an infection chain in the local community stochastically ends due to fluctuations (k/b). Stochastic desynchronization would further reduce the peak, since not all sub-populations reach peak values at the same time.",

Isolating even smaller communities from their surroundings (500 sub-populations of 16,000 people) leads to a further reduction of the peak to around 1% (85,000 people) on average (Figs. 2c and 2d ). This is comparable (or even slightly lower) than the case where the 500 infected individuals are not distributed randomly across the 500 sub-populations, but each sub-population contains exactly one infected individual. In this case (Fig. 3) , there are no sub-populations with initially zero infected individuals. This implies that the reduction in peak value compared to the large homogeneous population is strictly due to extinction, which also means that the remaining deviation from the prediction of Eq. (8) is probably due to desynchronization. The desynchronization for the three different ways of splitting up the population shown in Fig. 2 is quantified in Fig. 4a , which shows a broadening of the peak time distribution owing to increased stochasticity. Note that there is also a subtle, non-monotonic effect on the termination time of the epidemic, whose distribution also tends to become broader when the population is split up (Fig. 4b) .",

While this is obvious even from a deterministic standpoint in the case where many regions initially contain no infected individuals, our analysis shows that this advantage persists due to stochastic extinction events even if this is not the case, as long as I 0 /N s \u223c 1. Due to the exponential dependence of the extinction probability on n (see Eq. (8)) it is important to obtain a conservative estimate for I 0 , for example by adjusting the number of reported cases by an appropriate factor related to the detection probability. Naturally, such isolation will also automatically lead to a further reduction in b, so that the reduction will be even greater in practice. In addition, given the available data about the geographic distribution of infections, it should be possible to isolate the \"right\" communities and adjust their size much more intelligently than we have done here (where the infected individuals were distributed randomly or uniformly across sub-populations). This should further increase the likelihood of stochastic termination of the epidemic in many small communities (even if there are undetected cases), and should also allow for practical considerations and compromises regarding access restrictions to certain areas. Note that the additional desynchronization effect would also allow non-peak regions to provide medical support and hospital space to peak regions, further improving the management of the epidemic. Of course, this approach does not preclude the activation of more drastic individual confinement measures as a last resort in regions beginning to show deterministic exponential behaviour, while still sparing the majority of regions from them.",
