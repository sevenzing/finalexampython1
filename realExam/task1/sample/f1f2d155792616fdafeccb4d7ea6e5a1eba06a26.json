Recent mathematical models are aimed at studying dynamics of some specific types of infectious diseases. In this paper we propose a new model for infectious diseases spread having susceptible, infected, and recovered populations and study its dynamics in presence of incubation delays and relapse of the disease. The influence of treatment and vaccination efforts on the spread of infection in presence of time delays are studied. Sufficient conditions for local stability of the equilibria and change of stability are derived in various cases. The problem of global stability is studied for an important special case of the model. Simulations carried out in this study brought out the importance of treatment rate in controlling the disease spread. It is observed that incubation delays have influence on the system even under enhanced vaccination. The present study has clearly brought out the fact that treatment rate in presence of time delays would contain the disease as compared to popular belief that eradication can only be done through vaccination.",

The dynamics may well be understood by modeling causes or carriers of the disease. It is not possible all the time to control the media or carriers involved in spread of the infection and sometimes it may even be beyond determination. Many a time, we may not even recognize the presence of an infection until it becomes predominant. Mathematical modeling is a tool that has been popularly employed in prevention and control of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] , human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) [4] , H5N1 (avian flu) [37] and H1N1 (swine flu) [35] . Also, they have been useful in studying some of the drug resistant strains of malaria [12] , tuberculosis [5] , methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [17] and marine bacteriophage infection [3] .",

The susceptible-Infective (SI) model is useful in understanding diseases such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [26] as the host remain infected till they die. The susceptible-infective-susceptible (SIS) model is employed in studying infections such as Gonorrhea [31] as there is a possibility of host becoming susceptible to infection once again. The susceptible-infective-recovered (SIR) model is employed to understand diseases such as Syphilis [33] , wherein, immunity lasts for a limited period before waning such that the individual is once again susceptible. Dynamics of such systems are generally studied from two perspectives, (i) stability of disease-free equilibrium, and (ii) stability of endemic equilibrium. In the former case conditions under which pathogens suffer extinction leaving individuals as susceptible are studied, whereas in the later, conditions in which infective and susceptible populations coexist are established.",

            "text": "Interactions among populations in compartments such as the susceptible (x) and infected (y) is the key to understand the rate at which the infection can spread in the population. Models with bilinear interaction among populations (xy) tend to disease free equilibrium or endemic equilibrium [7] . Researchers have considered various interactions of non-linear type such as \u03b2x p y q [21, 22, 32, 39, 50] , xy 1+ax [53] , or xy 1+y [13, 16, 34, 44, 45, 46, 52] for further understanding dynamics of infectious diseases. It is observed that solutions of periodic nature do exist even without periodic forcing term in the model. The existence of periodic solutions are usually attributed to the presence of time delays in the system even in case of bilinear incidence. Delays do exist in disease transmission, known as the latency period of infection, from inception to an identifiable state. For some interesting studies on infectious disease models, readers are referred to [8, 14, 24, 15, 19, 23, 25, 28, 29, 47, 49, 51] . On the other hand, fluctuations in populations may also be attributed to changes in environment, especially, in open systems. These perturbations are influenced by the environment and may be treated as noise in the system. Dynamic models of competing species under the influence of a noise are extensively studied in [6, 9, 30, 48] . Predictive models based on both clinical, incidence data pertaining to infectious diseases and epidemics in general are discussed in [40, 41, 42] .",

The reproduction number represents the number of secondary cases that are caused by a primary case when introduced into a wholly susceptible population. Also, it is observed that if reproduction number is less than unity, the disease free equilibrium is stable, otherwise, the disease prevails [16] . When the nature of interaction is not known or the basic reproduction number is more than unity, one needs to find ways to restrict the disease to a minimum, manageable level, if the disease free environment cannot be provided. When it comes to the control of a disease, vaccination or preventive strategies could be a good choice during the early stages of the disease provided the population is not large enough. Emergence of vaccine resistant strains is one of the drawbacks of frequent or long term vaccination. When massive vaccination is not possible, the second stage of defensive mechanism could be medical treatment. This adds a new sub category of population called recovered class representing the population recovered by treatment.",

Theory says that (5, 0, 0) is asymptotically stable both locally and globally creating an eventual infectionfree environment.

When compared to the situation in Example 5.1, the equilibrium values of infected and recovered populations are considerably reduced from y * = 6 = z * to y * = 2 = z * , may be due to increased vaccination efforts. For small values of time delays, the disease equilibrium (2, 2, 2) is stable but as delay in incubation increases the equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory.

Results on global stability are also established for a special case of the proposed model. Situations where the effect of time delays on the stability of the equilibria is null and void are identified in this special case. It is important and interesting to further explore this view point for more general cases. In [2] it is observed that the vaccination threshold rate is admissible, beyond which the infection gets eradicated. But Examples 5.1 and 5.3 illustrate that vaccination alone cannot eradicate infection but it is the treatment rate that is playing a key role in controlling the disease when the system is influenced by time delays.",

Thereafter this equilibrium becomes unstable as predicted by the theory (see results in Sections 3 and 4). At the same time, simulations show that for \u03c4 > 4 the system is behaving very wild and large fluctuations are observed in infected and recovered populations. This situation is more vulnerable than having a stable endemic equilibrium where the situation may not be much beyond control. Thus, existence of a stable endemic equilibrium may sometimes be a better choice. Further, the behaviour of the system under the simultaneous influence of time delays (general case, Section 3.4) needs to be investigated in detail. For commensurate delays, study in Section 3.4 may provide an estimate but for other types of delays, more explicit estimates are required. However, we need to analyze such situations further.",

            "text": "This has both disease free (5, 0, 0) and endemic ( 5 3 , 20 9 , 20 9 ) equilibria. But neither Theorem 4.2 nor Theorem 4.1 holds for this case. Also system (29) in Example 5.5 allows no possibility for existence of a disease free equilibrium, and hence, no scope for disease free environment. Comments made in Section 2.1 are aimed at such situations. In such cases, we have to study the ways of controlling the infected populations rather than the stability of the system. This raises the following questions. How to control y? Can we find a small \u01eb \u2265 0 such that y(t) \u2264 \u01eb for some t \u2265 T. Can we create an inactive state (a 'zone of no activation') for the spreading of the disease? That means can we identify and keep the infected people in a quarantine (at least till vaccination is effective or treatment available is sufficient to meet the requirements)? This would be the point of contention in our future exposition.It is observed in [40] that for diseases like Chagas, the effort of vaccination is not adequate to control the disease and treatment is recommended in both acute and chronic stages of diseases. System (2) through Examples 5.1 to 5.7 illustrates such cases. Our examples conclude that when the treatment rate is high, a disease-free environment is created (stability of (2, 6, 6) -Example 5.1 to stability of (5, 0, 0) -Example 5.2). In the presence of improved vaccination effort alone, the infected and hence, recovered populations are lowered (stability of (2, 6, 6) -Example 5.1 to stability of (2, 2, 2) -Example 5.3). Under the influence of better vaccination in addition to high treatment rate, we notice a considerable decrease in susceptible population due to increased rate of infection (stability of (5, 0, 0) -Example 5.2 to stability of (2.5, 0, 0) -Example 5.4). It would be interesting to see how far our model explains the dynamics of Chagas disease.On the whole, our common expectations on the model really come true and this prompts us to analyze this model further with regard to its applicability for understanding various infectious diseases -this would be our scope of future study. We need to present simpler conditions on parameters and provide results for global asymptotic stability for general infection functions f (x, y).Also, global stability analysis of the model with general interaction, vaccination and recovery functions is in the offing. Infection rate, treatment Notice that we have taken V (x(t)) \u2261 V (t \u2212 \u03b3) in (1) for this case. (b) Vaccination effort being carried out at time t depends on a previous estimation of population. That is, we choose V (x(t)) = V (x(t \u2212 \u03b7)) in (1). We have3. Recovered population may take time to become susceptible again. That means, they could retain health for some time, say, \u00b5 > 0. This may be represented in (1) as,4. Though mathematical models can describe many plausible realistic phenomena, their usefulness is acceptable only if they stand the test on the real time data. Thus, it would be interesting to test the results of this article with available real time data so that necessary modifications or improvement of (1) may be taken up suitably. 5. Consider the influence of sudden environmental changes or other measures taken up to control the spread of disease (may be described as noise in the system). Introducing such term in (1), we havehere \u03b2(t, y) \u2265 0 for all t, y may be understood as the rate at which infected population is decreasing owing to changes in environment that are non-conducive for infection or measures taken up to keep the infected away from the system (isolation) or measures taken up by society for controlling the spread of the disease. Of course, a \u03b2(t, y) < 0 condition says that the situation is encouraging for growth of infected population.",
