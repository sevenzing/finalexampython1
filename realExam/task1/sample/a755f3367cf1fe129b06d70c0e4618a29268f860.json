They suggested that common coagulation activation and secondary 209 hyperfibrinolysis occur in the late stages of COVID-19 patients 21 . 210 Liver function was an important predictor for the mortality of patients with COVID-19. 211 A recent research indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may directly bind to ACE2-positive 212 cholangiocytes; thus, liver abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 may be due to 213 cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes, such as drug-induced and systemic inflammatory 214 response-induced liver injuries 22 . More research are needed, because most of our patients had 215 evidence of liver dysfunction prior to therapy. Multiple-organ dysfunction, including kidney 216 dysfunction, indicates poor survival outcome. In our study, GFR was remarkably lower in the 217 non-survivor group than in the survivor group. A research of critically ill patients with 218 COVID-19 in Wuhan showed that 29% had acute kidney injury 23 . Therefore, we suggest that 219 special care of kidney dysfunction should be included in the treatment of patients with 220 COVID-19 during hospitalization. 221 At present, this novel infection has no specific treatment, and the use of IgG and 222 systemic corticosteroid remains controversial; therefore, the early identification of patients 223 with poor prognosis and early active intervention (e.g., early respiratory support 22 , 224 continuous renal replacement therapy, and immune adsorption) to avoid disease development 225 are the key to treatment. However, early identification remains a difficult task for doctors as 226 the symptoms of COVID-19 are not typical. 227 The clinical model could help doctors to initially identify high-risk patients in settings 228 with limited medical resources, such as patients who are isolated at home. We observed 229 relatively high sensitivity (92.31%) and NPV (99.34%), which means a lower likelihood of 230 missing high-risk individuals; a relatively low PPV (21.43%), which means a higher 231 likelihood of misjudging individuals with actually low-risk. Therefore, the clinical model is 232 suitable for the initial screening. The laboratory model showed better discriminatory power 233 than the clinical model with an AUC value of 0.98, sensitivity and NPV of 100.00%. Baseline 234 data for the model can be obtained in the patient's first routine examination after admission 235 and can help doctors surmise the prognosis at an early stage and guide subsequent treatments; 236 hence, the patients who are prone to develop the disease at critical level can get close 237 attention and high-level treatments in advance. This model can also be used as a reference for 238 transferring patients from community hospitals or square cabin hospitals (the temporary 239 hospital for the placement and observation of mildly ill patients and suspected cases) to 240 higher-level hospitals. 241In the model validation phase, we also observed good discriminatory powers with the 242 AUCs of 0.83 and 0.88 for clinical model and laboratory model, respectively.

First, our research were carried out among patients 256 with COVID-19 in Wuhan; therefore, further verification is needed in populations in other 257 areas. Second, the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time 258 interval between admission and onset. Third, our analyses did not include data such as body 259 mass index and viral load, which are potential risk factors to predict the severity of infection. 260However, our predictive models still showed good discriminatory power after verification in 261 heterogeneous population. Fourth, we did not collect treatment-related data (such as 262 mechanical ventilation) which may be critical to patient's prognosis. However, all hospitals in 263China carried out treatment in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National health 264 commission of China 25 .
