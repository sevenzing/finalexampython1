Similarly to what is happening in other countries, an important reduction in available operating rooms is affecting our departments. In this study, we aim to know how Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the delivery of plastic surgery services in Spain. Methods A questionnaire addressing some of our concerns about how the Coronavirus crisis might severelyimpact our specialty has been sent to the heads of the divisions of plastic surgery of several hospitals across Spain. Results A total of 12 plastic surgery departments from different hospitals across the country agreed to participate in the survey. Most plastic surgery teams will need to maintain 50-80% of their staff in order to be able to offer emergency and undelayable oncological procedures. The total amount of procedures currently being performed ranged from 0 to 44% of the figures before the coronavirus outbreak, except for one department, with elective surgery mainly affected. Microsurgical cases have been massively discontinued during this crisis. Conclusions Plastic surgery delivery in the Spanish Health System is being severely impacted as a collateral damage from this pandemic. Most of the elective surgery is currently stopped.

Our center is a third level hospital with an estimated capacity of 1400 hundred beds. Our department attends to a regional population of approximately a million and a half patients and includes a burn unit and a pediatric clinic. Similarly to what is happening in the North of Italy [1] , and according to our hospital guidelines, we have adopted several new measures. Most of our outpatient clinics have been postponed. All elective, non-urgent, and non-cancer procedures have been stopped in an effort to anticipate the need of relocating nurses and anesthesiologists to tackle Covid-19 situations. Consequently, we have reduced the number of attending surgeons and residents working on a daily basis to the minimum required. The goal is to keep the department functioning, while avoiding infections between the team members. Emergency surgeries during the on-call shifts will continue.

Consequently, even short reductions in our groups could easily cause unsustainable increases in the number of shifts per consultant. This might pose a challenge against the delivery of emergency surgeries and cancer care to our community if this pandemic lasts for a prolonged period long time According to our analysis, reductions of about 20-50% in the total number of consultants per team may lead to this situation.

Only one of the institutions we have contacted maintains its usual activity. This is probably related to the geographical location of this center, in a region where the pandemic is considerably milder compared to other places. Analyzing how the approach to day-care surgery is different amid the departments may lead to interesting conclusions. While some departments have stopped most of their day-care procedures and operate only more severe, inpatient cases; others try to do as many cases as they can in a day-care approach, minimizing admissions. These two alternative options are most likely related to the availability of beds and the severity of the outbreak in each hospital. It has been difficult to obtain data from urgent cases only. It will be interesting to know if urgent cases have actually been reduced. NHS hospitals in England have also been told to suspend all non-urgent elective surgery for at least 3 months from April 15 as a measure to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1166, "end": 1169, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "As previously stated, the reduction in surgical activity seems to have mainly impacted elective reconstructive surgery. Departments are currently using all their resources to perform cancer-related surgeries that cannot be delayed. However, further analysis needs to be conducted in order to confirm that access to oncological surgeries is not being significantly affected. If the current situation keeps worsening, the delay in diagnosis and management of cancer patients could be catastrophic. Our hospital guidance for the pandemic, similar to those used in other institutions, has established three possible levels of alert. They will be applied depending on the severity of this continuously evolving crisis. We are currently in the phase 2 scenario. In the last step (phase 3), ventilators might become hardly available, and life-saving surgeries are the only procedures performed [3] . Some General Surgery departments in China [4] adopted guidelines recommending multidisciplinary approaches and encouraging them to use non-surgical anti-tumor therapies as the first choice for the management of gastrointestinal malignancies. By doing so, even oncological surgeries were reduced to those that are unavoidable. Some of these surgeries can include the absence of therapeutic alternatives to surgery for tumor control, intestinal obstructions not amenable to stenting, or gastrointestinal bleeds not controlled by embolization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A uniform and steep decrease in PRS clinics have taken place in all the hospitals in this article.

Similarly, elective micro cases such as immediate or delayed DIEPs have been temporarily suspended in Spain. Unfortunately, this population of patients consumes longer OR times, occupies more resources at the reanimation units, and stays longer periods of time in our facilities.
