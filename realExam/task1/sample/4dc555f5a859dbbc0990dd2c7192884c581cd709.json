Because study focus was on evaluating drugs 155 or plasma treatments, we excluded trials of stem cell transplants, devices, diagnostic tests, traditional 156 Chinese medicines/herbal medicine, rehabilitation, dietary supplements and psychological 157 interventions. We did not limit any studies based on the outcomes they evaluated. We also excluded 158 one trial with implausible information regarding its study design (a single-arm randomized controlled 159 trial). 182 blinding was unclear. In such cases, two reviewers (HM, SE) independently reviewed the registry 183 record in detail and extracted the information. If, after in depth review, study design was still unclear 184 (n=37), we used the following rules to assign intervention model and blinding: (i) trials with a single 185 group were considered as non-randomized and open-label; 17 (ii) trials that reported more than one 186 group were considered having a parallel group design; (iii) trials were considered open-label if blinding 187 was not reported and could not be inferred.
