The downstream ORF1b is expressed as a fusion protein with pp1a by a mechanism involving a ( 1) ribosomal frame shift during translation. 1, 2 The ORF1a/1b gene product has a calculated molecular mass of 754 kDa and is referred to as polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab). pp1a and pp1ab are processed by two virusencoded, papain-like proteases and the main protease M pro , resulting in at least 16 non structural proteins (Nsps). 3 Several or all of these nonstructural proteins build the replicase complex, probably mediating all the functions necessary for polyprotein processing, viral transcription, and replication. 4 The 3\u00b4 region of the coronaviral ORF1a encodes a set of relatively small polypeptides (Nsp6 to Nsp11), of which only SARS-CoV Nsp9 has had a function assigned, i.e., as ssDNA/RNA-binding protein. 5, 6 In mouse hepatitis CoV, several of these polypeptides colocalize with other components of the viral replication complex in the perinuclear region of the infected cell. 7 Thus, the HCoV-229E polypeptides Nsp 6, 7, 8, and 10 are probably involved, directly or indirectly, in the viral replication complex. In this communication, we will describe the expression of genes coding for HCoV-229E Nsp8 and Nsp9, as well as the purification and biophysical characterization of the proteins. The two proteins are shown to bind tRNA using zoneinterference electrophoresis and fluorescence spectroscopy.",

Cultures were grown in TY medium at 37\u00b0C until cells reached an O.D. of 0.4 at 660 nm. Cells were then induced with 1 mM IPTG and grew for a further 5 h for Nsp8 and 4 h for Nsp9 at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5500 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting pellets were frozen at -20\u00b0C. For lysis, the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 300 mM NaCl pH 7.5 (25\u00b0C). Cells were broken by ultrasonification on ice after adding glycerol (1%, v/v, for Nsp8, and 10%, v/v, for Nsp9), 20 mM imidazole, 0.01% (w/v) n-octyl-\u03b2-glucoside (Bachem) (final concentrations). To optimize the solubilization of overproduced Nsp8 and Nsp9, a sparse matrix screen of buffer composition was applied. 8 The sample was ultracentrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C (Kontron TGA centrifuge, TFT 45.94 rotor). The supernatant was applied to a His Trap HP column (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After washing with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (25\u00b0C), the protein was eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 20 mM up to 500 mM imidazole. The engineered N-terminal His-tag contained a SARS-CoV M pro cleavage site. Therefore, by incubating Nsp9 with M pro in a molar ratio of 100:1 for 16 h at 37\u00b0C in a reduced state (5mM DTT), the His tag was cleaved off from the Nsp9. Protein was blotted and detected with anti-tetra-histidine antibodies (Dianova) and anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma).",

Therefore, the single tryptophan in Nsp9 is more exposed to the hydrophilic environment than the two tryptophans in Nsp8. Remarkably, the tryptophan fluorescence of the two nonstructural proteins was quenched by increasing concentrations of E. coli tRNA (Fig. 4 B) . At 5 \u00b5M tRNA, the intensity of the emitted light was only 20% of the fluorescence in the absence of tRNA. The tryptophan fluorescence quenching clearly demonstrated binding of the two proteins to tRNA in the lower micromolar range.
