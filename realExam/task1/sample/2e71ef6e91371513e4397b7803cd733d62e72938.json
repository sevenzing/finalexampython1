There was no limit to the duration of symptoms prior to enrollment. Participants had to have a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a positive reverse transcription, polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay result from any respiratory specimen collected <72 hours prior to randomization. During the study, this criterion was modified due to limitations in testing capacity to also allow a RT-PCR positive specimen that was collected \u226572 hours prior to randomization if the site was unable to obtain a repeat sample and if the participant had progressive disease consistent with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other inclusion criteria included agreeing not to participate in another COVID-19 treatment clinical trial through Day 29 and practicing heterosexual abstinence or using study-specified contraception through Day 29 for women of childbearing potential. Exclusion criteria included having either an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 5 times the upper limit of the normal range; impaired renal function as determined by calculating an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or need for hemodialysis or hemofiltration; allergy to study product;", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Additional Study population Details"}, {"text": "pregnancy or breast-feeding; and anticipated discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital within 72 hours of enrollment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Additional Study population Details"}, {"text": "The primary analysis was a log-rank test of time-to-recovery between remdesivir and placebo stratified by disease severity as defined above. The relevant treatment efficacy parameter is the \"recovery rate ratio\" (for remdesivir relative to placebo), which is akin to the hazard ratio in survival analysis but for the beneficial outcome of recovery. Two practical considerations result from considering time to a beneficial outcome. First, a recovery rate ratio greater than one indicates an improvement for remdesivir. Second, failure to recover and death are both censored at Day 29. Consequently, participants censored on the last observation day reflect two different states: death and failure to recover by Day 29. Hence, a breakdown of deaths by treatment arm is also important to understanding treatment efficacy.
