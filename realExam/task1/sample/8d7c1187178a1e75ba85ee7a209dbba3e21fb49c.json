The adhesive side of the wrap faces into the box. Each box can be constructed in approximately 30 minutes by two people (Image 1). Total material cost is less than 50 US dollars. During intubation, the box is laid over the patient to cover his head and upper chest. Using a knife or any other sharp device, two vertical incisions can be made to place hands through (Image 2). Equipment can be passed through either the incisions or under the bottom of the plastic covering. Ideally the intubation being performed would be video laryngoscopy so that the healthcare worker would not be required to be close to the patient's oropharynx. Following intubation, the box could be removed or ventilator tubing could be passed through incisions in the plastic. To limit ventilator circuit disconnection, tubing could be passed underneath the frame. Following use, the automobile collision wrap can be discarded and the frame can be cleaned according to CDC guidelines with wipes or sprayed down with appropriate cleaning agent. Once dry, a new length of automobile collision wrap can again be used to cover sides of the device in preparation for the next patient.",
