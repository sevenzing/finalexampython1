Although the management and disposition of bodies is distressing and heartrending, it is a task that local, state, and federal governments must plan for and respond to collaboratively with the private sector and faith-based community. When mass fatalities are mismanaged, there are grave emotional and mental health consequences that can delay recovery and undermine community resilience. Using insights from one of the author's mass fatality management research during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, this article explores how mass fatalities are being managed in response to COVID-19. Based on the researcher's findings a decade ago, it is apparent that many lessons have not been learnt. This This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This refers to the idea that survivors are so preoccupied with identifying bodies and conducting proper burials/funeral that they are unable to fully recover (Gupta 2016, 305-11) . COVID-19 represents an example of the Zeigarnik effect as the pandemic has overwhelmed the infrastructure for dealing with the deceased and as a result, the deceased have not always been handled with dignity. Indeed, the number of bodies awaiting cremation and burial from COVID-19 deaths has overwhelmed morgue capacities worldwide, resulting in a lack of dignity for the deceased. For example, when one Detroit hospital reached morgue capacity, bodies of COVID-19 victims were stacked in empty hospital rooms, without regard for how those deceased and their family members expected bodies to be treated following death (Young, Carpenter, and Murphy 2020) .",

In China, some families of COVID-19 victims were forced to wait significantly longer than usual to collect the ashes of loved ones, even though cremations were done immediately after death (Goh 2020). With the rush of cremation, family members were left not knowing which funeral parlor to contact for the remains of their loved ones (Fifield and Li 2020). A similar situation occurred in Ecuador, where government representatives quickly collected bodies after COVID-19 deaths, without proper communication to the family about where bodies are delivered and stored. Some Ecuadorians searched through body bags in morgues to find their deceased family members, while others were still unsure where to find the remains (Armario 2020). Proper grieving cannot begin without a body and not knowing where a loved one is located creates uncertainty, which can have mental health effects, such as psychiatric and social dysfunction (Williams and Crews 2003, 252) .",

Around the world, funerals were limited or canceled due to COVID-19 and cultural practices to honor the dead were not followed. For example, in China, typically cremation would not be carried out until after a three-day vigil, but during the pandemic, bodies were immediately cremated after death, disregarding cultural practices (Goh 2020). This left family members choosing between forgoing the vigil, leaving the family without a proper mourning, or holding a vigil after the cremation has already occurred, inconsistent with current cultural practices. Changes in funeral operations made it difficult for those mourning to move past the grieving stage and inhibited their ability to rely on the community and loved ones for support since they were left to grieve in isolation. In Italy, for example, prior to the pandemic, funerals were well attended by community members where approximately 600-1,000 Italians attended funerals to support survivors and pay their respects to the dead (Horowitz and Bubola 2020).

Survivors of similar diseases (e.g., SARS and MERS) were associated with higher levels of PTSD and suicides (Shah et al. 2020, 3-5) . This will likely be similar for COVID-19 survivors and mental health issues will be exacerbated by being unable to follow proper protocol for the afterlife.

One of the mass grave sites in Titanyen, a city in the outskirt of Port-au-Prince, contained over 70,000 bodies. Burials during the Ebola outbreak and the Haiti earthquake were atypical, disrupting the mourning process. Following the earthquake in Haiti, there were efforts to accommodate religious and cultural practices for the afterlife, but ultimately this was not possible due to the number of deaths, and most people were buried in mass graves without the usual religious and cultural practices (McEntire, Sadiq, and Gupta 2012, 33) .

In Haiti, the author interviewed MFM response officials, including morgue directors, forensic pathologists, doctors, voodoo priests, nonprofit representatives, local This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Accepted Article residents, and funeral home representatives. The author explored how bodies were recovered, identified, stored, returned to family members, and buried or cremated. These interviews revealed fatalities from the earthquake were difficult to manage because of the high number of deaths and equipment shortages. Based on this experience, it is apparent that many lessons have not been learnt a decade later. For example, many communities still do not have MFM plans, set aside resources for MFM, or provide psychological support for survivors of mass fatality incidents. This author's work informs the recommendations presented below to aid governments in their attempts to improve MFM and enhance community resilience.",

Other important considerations include exercising the plan, updating the plan, and ensuring the plan is sensitive to the prevailing cultural practices for the deceased (Col 2007; PAHO 2004) . Conducting exercises during times of normalcy gives government officials the opportunity to test the MFM plan, identify gaps, and recommend improvements to the plan. It is also important to regularly update the plan. For example, if a city partners with a private entity to provide refrigerated trucks for transporting decedents, the plan should be updated to include information about this new partnership. Finally, the plan should be sensitive to the burial culture of the area where the mass fatality incident occurred. In fact, PAHO guidelines dictates that the culture and religious beliefs of the area should be respected (PAHO 2004) . The death of a loved one as a result of a pandemic can be exacerbated because family members may not be able to carry out their traditional burial ceremonies due to the risk of contagion. For example, in Iran, those killed by COVID-19 are not buried according to the Islamic tradition of washing the corpse, shrouding corpse in white cloth, and a cleric praying over the corpse (Etehed 2020). The inability to properly say goodbye to a loved one could lead to additional stress on the family of the victims. Thus, it is crucial for the MFM plan to include alternative, safe, and acceptable ways for victims' families to bid farewell to their loved ones.",

In fact, after the Haiti earthquake, the availability of MFM resources-experienced personnel (e.g., Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team), bulldozers, front loaders, PPEs, DNA testing, body bags, etc.-was a major factor that contributed to a more effective recovery and identification of US citizens that perished in comparison with Haitian citizens that were killed (McEntire, Sadiq, and Gupta 2012, 7-10; Sadiq and McEntire 2012, 459-70) . During the COVID-19 response, hospitals, funeral homes, morgues, crematories, etc., are experiencing significant shortage of resources. For example, in Ecuador, the government distributed cardboard coffins to bury the dead due to the shortage of coffins (Rivers 2020). While in New York City, some COVID-19 victims are temporarily buried in Hart Island due to shortage of morgue space (Kilgannon 2020) . If these MFM resources are in short supply, mutual aid agreements with other local, state, national and international entities should augment existing MFM resources. COVID-19 has underscored the important roles of private entities providing additional resources during a pandemic. For example, in the US, private organizations have increased their production of equipment and supplies like respirators, PPE, face mask, etc. Hence, in addition to having mutual aid agreements with other public entities, there is a need to complement agreements with public private partnerships to be able to access additional MFM resources through increased production by the private sector (Barth 2020).",

During a pandemic, no single entity has all the resources to fight the pandemic. Hence, collaboration among public, private, and nonprofit organizations, as well as faith-based groups, volunteer groups, citizens, etc., can lead to an effective response and speedy recovery from the pandemic. For example, the successful MFM response of US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to the crash of Flight 3407 in Buffalo, New York on 12 th February, 2009, which killed a total of 50 people was credited to the collaboration mindset of the NTSB (Vidal and Feinman 2017) .

When all stakeholders work collaboratively, they are able to build trust, work as a team, communicate better, and reach consensus (Blanchard et al., 2007; Sadiq and Tyler 2017) . COVID-19 has, hitherto, indicated a lack of collaboration in certain areas. For example, there is competition among governments for limited resources (e.g., respirators), citizens not adhering to government directives (social distancing, stay home order, wearing masks in public), misinformation or muzzling of information by governments, and slow production of equipment and supplies from the private sector (Teklemariam 2020) . To foster collaboration during mass fatality incidents, we recommend establishing a pandemic task force consisting of all relevant stakeholders mentioned above and should not just consist of federal government officials as is the case of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.",

In fact, the guidance suggests developing an agreement with the family regarding burial practices and contacting local faith representatives for the burial (World Health Organization 2017). The guidance further suggests that a limited number of family members can participate in the burial process and although the family should not touch or bathe the body, the family members should be given an alternative, such as sprinkling water over the body (World Health Organization 2017). The WHO released additional guidelines specific to COVID-19, further reiterating that cultural and religious traditions should be honored and that immediate disposal of the dead should be avoided (World Health Organization 2020a). Given the issues addressed in the prior section, it does not seem that the lessons learned from prior epidemics and the guidance developed are incorporated in the mass fatality response to COVID-19.",
