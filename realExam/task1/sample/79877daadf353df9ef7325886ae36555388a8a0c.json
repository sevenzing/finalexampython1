Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic, the question emerges whether human-to-animal transmission is possible and if so, which animal species are most at risk. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also predict affinityenhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.",

Based on comparative genomics, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from an animal host, most likely bats or pangolins [2] . Given the widespread human-to-human transmission across the globe, the question emerges whether humans can infect other animal species with SARS-CoV-2, namely domestic and farm animals. Identifying potential intermediate hosts that can act as reservoirs for the virus has both important global health, animal welfare, and ecological implications.",

            "text": "During the course of this pandemic, there have been several news reports of domestic, farm, and zoo animals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Belgium [3] and New York [4] reported positive symptomatic cases in cats, The Netherlands reported infection of minks in farms [5] , and the Bronx Zoo in New York reported infections in lions and tigers [6] . In all these cases, the vehicle of transmission appears to be an infected human owner or handler. More importantly, in the case of the mink farms in The Netherlands, there is evidence of human-to-animal-to-human transmission. In addition to these reported cases, several groups put forward both pre-prints and peer-reviewed studies on animal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 under controlled laboratory conditions [7] [8] [9] , two of which are of particular interest. The first study showed that cats, civets, and ferrets are susceptible to infection; pigs, chickens, and ducks are not, while the results for dogs were inconclusive [7] . A second study, using human cells expressing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor proteins showed that camels, cattle, cats, horses, sheep, and rabbit can be infected with the virus, but not chicken, ducks, guinea pigs, pigs, mice, and rats [8] . Together, these studies provide a dataset of confirmed susceptible and non-susceptible species that we can use to find molecular discriminants between the two groups. For simplicity, from here on we will refer to susceptible and non-susceptible species as SARS-CoV-2 pos and SARS-CoV-2 neg , respectively.",

            "text": "Like SARS-CoV-1 before, SARS-CoV-2 infection starts with the binding of the viral spike protein to the extracellular protease domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [10] , a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed on the surface of a variety of tissues, including along the respiratory tract and the intestine. Several biophysical and structural studies identified helices \u03b11 and \u03b12, as well as a short loop between strands \u03b23 and \u03b24 in ACE2 as the interface for the viral spike protein [10] [11] [12] [13] . These studies also identified key differences between the sequences of the receptor binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, which explain the stronger interaction of the latter with human ACE2. As such, we can reasonably assume that sequence variation across ACE2 orthologs might explain why some animal species are susceptible to infection while others are not. In addition, combining structural and binding data with the natural diversity of ACE2 across species is likely to shine a light on the key aspects that drive ACE2 interaction to viral RBDs and ultimately help guide the development of therapeutic molecules against SARS-CoV-2.",

Two recent preprints, specifically, focus on the effects of ACE2 variation on RBD binding. The first used an ACE2 sequence library to select for mutants that bind RBD with high affinity, identifying several mutants that enhance or decrease affinity to the viral protein and providing a blueprint for engineering proteins and peptides with therapeutic purposes [14] . While useful, we note that the authors carried out a single round of selection as opposed to the multiple rounds commonly carried out in similar studies. The second study used computational modeling to predict \u0394\u0394G of mutations in 215 animal species and assess their risk for infection [15] . In addition, the authors also identified a number of locations on ACE2 that contribute to binding the viral RBD, in particular residues 31, 38, 353, as well as a cluster of N-terminal hydrophobic amino acid residues.",

After refinement, we found that models of SARS-CoV-2 pos species generally have a lower (better) score than those of SARS-CoV-2 neg species. Further, we carried out a per-residue energy analysis that identified key locations in ACE2 that are consistently mutated across SARS-CoV-2 neg species. Collectively, our results provide a structural framework that explains why certain animal species are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggests potential mutations that can enhance binding to the viral RBD.",

All orthologs are reasonably conserved, with global similarity values to the human ACE2 sequence (hACE2) ranging from 72% (goldfish) to 99.5% (chimpanzee) (Figure 1 , left panel). All species coarsely cluster in three classes consistent with evolutionary distance to humans: primates have the highest similarity values, followed by other mammals, birds and reptiles, and finally fish. Zooming in on the interface residues, we find substantially more variation (Figure 1, right panel) . Similarity values for these residues range from 50% (crocodile) to 100% (all 3 primates) but, despite an overall correlation (Pearson R 2 of 0.69), do not always match global similarities. Hedgehogs and sheep, for example, share 86.7% and 86.4% global similarity with hACE2, respectively, but 59% and 95.5% for the interface region. In absolute numbers, these similarities mean that sheep share 21 out of 22 residues with hACE2 at the interface with RBD, while hedgehogs share 13. The horseshoe bat, one of the proposed animal reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2, shares 72.2% interface similarity with hACE2, a comparable value to the 77.3% of the SARS-CoV-2 neg mouse sequence. Altogether, these results prompt two observations. First, neither global nor interface sequence similarity is predictive of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Second, that the interface of the viral RBD is substantially plastic and able to bind to sufficiently different ACE2 orthologs.",

We used the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD, in the presence of the amino acid transporter B 0 AT1 (PDB ID: 6m17). Compared to a high-resolution crystal structure of the same complex (PDB ID: 6m0j), the cryo-EM structure lacks several key contacts between our two proteins of interest, which we attribute to poor density for side-chain atoms at the interface region. Our refinement protocol restores the majority of these contacts (Table S1) , yielding an average HADDOCK score of -116.2 (arbitrary units) for the 10 best models of the best cluster. See Materials and Methods for further details on the protocol. These negative HADDOCK scores suggest a favorable interface and agree with scores calculated for a reference set of transient protein-protein interactions (N=144, HADDOCK score=-124.9 \u00b1 53.4) [18] . The interfaces in our models are dominated by hydrogen bond interactions involving the ACE2 \u03b11 helix and a small loop between strands \u03b23 and \u03b24. There is one single salt-bridge involving hACE2 D30 and RBD K417 consistently present in all our hACE2 models. These observations all agree with the published crystal structure. Further, the buried surface area of the refined models is also in agreement with published crystal structures (~1800 \u00c5 2 ). As such, considering the low quality of the interface region in our template structure, we are confident that our modeling and refinement protocol is robust enough to model all ACE2 orthologs.",

In our models, electrostatics are the most discriminatory component (Pearson R 2 of 0.60), followed by desolvation (0.31), and finally van der Waals (0.08). These correlations suggest that differences between the models of the different species originate primarily in polar and charged residues, in agreement with observations from experimental structures. In addition, the buried surface area of the models also correlates quite strongly with the HADDOCK score (Pearson R 2 of 0.66), which is unsurprising since larger interfaces tend to make more contacts. Most models bury between 1700 and 1850 \u00c5 2 , in agreement with the crystal and cryo-EM structures, while the topscoring species (dog and goldfish) bury nearly 2000 \u00c5 2 and the lowest-scoring (mouse) bury only 1600 \u00c5 2 .

However, and quite beautifully, dromedaries compensate the possible electrostatic repulsion between E31 and E35 with a lysine at position 76 (Q76 in hACE2) leading to the formation of an additional intramolecular salt-bridge that stabilizes the fold of ACE2 and frees E35 to hydrogen bond with Q493 in 90% of our models. All three SARS-CoV-2 neg species have an additional charge-reversal mutation at position 35, although with different outcomes in our models.

In addition, in most of our models, the aromatic ring of H34 is close enough (<4.5 \u00c5) to the aliphatic side-chain of RBD L455 to form productive hydrophobic interactions. Our energetic analysis shows that substituting H34 by polar (serine, threonine) or hydrophobic (leucine, valine) residues destabilizes the interface, while substitution by a tyrosine substantially contributes to a stronger interaction. SARS-CoV-2 neg species except mouse and rat have hydrophobic residues at position 34, losing the ability to hydrogen bond with RBD Y453. In addition, the side-chain of RBD L455 is often out of range of hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, the H34Y substitution in the dog, ferret, and civet sequences loses the intramolecular hydrogen bond with E37 but compensates by hydrophobic interactions with nearby RBD residues and hydrogen bonds with RBD R403 (ferret), S494 (civet) or Y495 (dog).

The first of these sites is K353 (in hACE2), which is involved in an intramolecular saltbridge with D38 and an additional backbone hydrogen bond with RBD G502. In rat and mouse ACE2, both SARS-CoV-2 neg species, this residue is mutated to a histidine, which weakens the interaction with D38, possibly leading to increased conformational dynamics of the \u03b23-\u03b24 loop and consequently lower binding affinity. Then, position 42, a glutamine in hACE2 and in most other species, hydrogen bonds with RBD Y449 in the majority of our models. In canary, chicken, pigeon, hedgehog, duck, and crocodile ACE2 sequences, this amino acid is mutated to a glutamate. This substitution introduces the possibility of an additional intramolecular salt-bridge with K68, in ACE2 helix \u03b12, which we observe in some of our models, preventing the formation of the intermolecular hydrogen bond. Finally, Y83 in hACE2 is mutated to phenylalanine in canary, chicken, rat, duck, and mouse ACE2, mostly SARS-CoV-2 neg species. Although our models do not offer a clear reason as to why this mutation could be damaging to RBD binding, the loss of the terminal hydroxyl group could have two negative consequences. First, there is the clear loss of two possible hydrogen bonds, with ACE2 Q24 and RBD N487. Then, the gain in hydrophobicity could lead the aromatic moiety to bury between both \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices, causing RBD F486 to lose a valuable interaction partner.",

Our modeling ranks guinea pig ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 neg ) as a better receptor for SARS-CoV-2 RBD than for example, human, cat, horse, or rabbit ACE2 (all SARS-CoV-2 pos species), despite experiments showing that there is negligible binding between the two proteins [8] .

            "text": "These two results highlight the need for critical thinking when evaluating predictions from computational models. As noted earlier in the introduction, SARS-CoV-2 infection is a complex multi-step process [21] . Thus, while we can assume that impaired ACE2 binding decreases odds of infection, we cannot state that ACE2 binding is predictive of infection. For instance, experiments with recombinant ACE2 show that the pig ortholog binds SARS-CoV-2 RBD and leads to entry of the virus in host cells [8] , but tests in live animals returned negative results [7] . In addition, our modeling protocol makes assumptions about the bound state of the two proteins, starting from the cryo-EM template structure. However, cryo-EM structures of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [22] highlight multiple unbound conformations for RBD, and coarse-grained simulations of the hACE2:RBD complex show that there is substantial flexibility in some of the interfacial RBD loops [23] . Altogether, these limitations show that computational models alone cannot predict whether certain animal species are at risk of infection. What our models do predict, however, is that there are distinctive molecular features characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 neg species. As the adage goes, 'all models are wrong, but some are useful.' SARS-CoV-2 neg species lack important polar and charged ACE2 residues On further inspection, we find that SARS-CoV-2 neg models rank worse due to a substantial decrease in electrostatic energy (Figure 3 ), indicating loss of polar interface contacts, namely hydrogen bonds and saltbridges ( Figure 4) . Indeed, models of mouse, duck, rat, and chicken lack the ability to form an intermolecular salt-bridge with RBD due to the loss of hACE2 D30. These predictions are supported by experimental work, where mutants lacking a negative charge at this position are largely unable to bind RBD [14] . Non-conservative mutations at other sites on ACE2 also contribute negatively to the interface scores. Residues K31 and H34 (hACE2) engage multiple neighboring residues in both intra-and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, contributing both to ACE2 fold stability and RBD binding, respectively. Our models suggest that the introduction of a negatively charged residue at position 31 is disruptive to binding, in agreement with experiments [14] . In SARS-CoV-2 pos species, like dromedary camels, this mutation is more likely to be tolerated due to additional compensatory mutations that stabilize the ACE2 fold and still allow for contacts with RBD. In all SARS-CoV-2 neg species except guinea pig however, there are no additional mutations to compensate for this substitution. As for position 34, our predictions contrast with experimental measurements [14] , which show that mutation to a hydrophobic residue improves binding between ACE2 and RBD. In our models, the preference seems to be for aromatic residues (histidine, tyrosine) capable of both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. We note, however, that our coverage of sequence space is limited to naturally occurring variants. Unlike in the work referenced before [14] , where the selection driver is RBD binding, natural selection of ACE2 might impose additional constraints on sequence variability. Finally, our models suggest that reduced flexibility of ACE2 might be a positive contributor to RBD binding affinity. Disrupting an intramolecular salt-bridge between D38 and K353 by substituting K353 with a shorter polar amino acid residue is a consistent feature in mice and rats, both SARS-CoV-2 neg species. These results support other computational modeling work [17] that suggest that RBD mutants G496D bind worse to ACE2 because of the disruption of this intramolecular salt-bridge.",

The clearest affinity enhancer seems to be D30E, a variant observed in 6 of the 8 best scoring species ( Figure 4 ) and shown in experiments to increase binding to RBD [8, 14] . The longer side-chain of a glutamate residue can help strengthen and stabilize the intermolecular salt-bridge with RBD K417. The impact of such conservative mutations in stabilizing protein interactions has been reported previously for other systems [24] . The second predicted enhancer is H34Y, which as we discussed above, contrasts with experimental measurements.

In addition, we propose possible affinityenhancing mutants that can help guide engineering efforts for the development of ACE2-based antiviral therapeutics. Despite the aforementioned limitations, our protocol and models can easily be replicated using freely-available tools and web servers and serve as a blueprint for future modeling studies on ACE2 interactions with coronaviruses' RBDs.

We used the fastest library schedule for model optimization and the very_fast schedule for model refinement.

Hydrogen bonds were defined between any donor atom (nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur bound to a hydrogen atom) within 2.5 \u00c5 of an acceptor atom (nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur), if the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle was between 120 and 180 degrees. Salt bridges were defined between two residues with a pair of cationic/anionic groups within 4 \u00c5 of each other. Finally, two aromatic residues were defined as stacking if the centers of mass of the aromatic groups were within 7.5 \u00c5 (pi-stacking) or 5 \u00c5 (t-stacking) and the angle between the planes of the rings was between 0 and 30 degrees (pi-stacking) or between 60 and 90 degrees (t-stacking).

Briefly, the protocol was the following. For each model, since HADDOCK uses a united-atom force field, we first added missing hydrogen atoms and minimized their coordinates, keeping all other atoms fixed. We marked a residue of ACE2 as part of the interface if any of its atoms were within 5 \u00c5 of any atom of RBD, and vice-versa. We then calculated the electrostatics, van der Waals, and desolvation energies for each of these residues, considering only atoms belonging to the other protein chain. Note that this protocol does not account for intramolecular effects of mutations. Finally, we calculated the HADDOCK score per residue, using the default scoring function weights, and averaged per-residue values for the best 10 models of the best cluster of each species. . HADDOCK scores of modeled ACE2 orthologs bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The HADDOCK score predicts the strength of the interaction between proteins. Models of SARS-CoV-2 pos species (green) generally have better (more negative) scores than SARS-CoV-2 neg species (red), suggesting that impaired binding between the two proteins might explain differences in viral susceptibility. The scores shown here are the average of the 10 best models for each ACE2 ortholog. Figure 3 . Correlation of HADDOCK score with individual energy terms and structural features. Differences in electrostatics energy contribute the most towards discriminating SARS-CoV-2 pos species (green) from SARS-CoV-2 neg species (red), supporting observations of hydrogen bonding networks and charged interactions in experimental structures. The buried surface area of the models is also correlated with their HADDOCK score. The units for van der Waals and electrostatics energies, desolvation, and buried surface area are kcal.mol -1 , arbitrary units, and \u00c5 2 , respectively. The human complex is shown in black for reference. Figure 4 . HADDOCK score of individual ACE2 interface residues. Amino acid residues at positions 30, 31, 34, and 353 are predicted to be the largest contributors to the stability of the interface. SARS-CoV-2 neg (red labels) species consistently show changes in these positions which could explain their non-susceptibility to the virus. The top-scoring SARS-CoV-2 pos (green labels) also suggest that hACE2 D30E and H34Y could potentially act as affinity enhancers. For each species, each block represents an interface residue of ACE2. The identity of the amino acid is shown in one-letter codes. The colors represent the average HADDOCK score of each particular residue over the best 10 models: lower scores (blue) indicate more favorable interactions. Positive scores (dark red) indicate steric clashes or electrostatic repulsion. Blank squares indicate that in that ortholog, that position is not part of the interface of the complex.
