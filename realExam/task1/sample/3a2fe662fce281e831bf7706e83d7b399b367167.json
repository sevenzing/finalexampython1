Composite DNA transposons found in bacteria such as Tn10, Tn5, and Tn9 contain a middle region (often encoding a drug resistance gene) flanked by two IS elements. Owing to these flanking IS elements, the middle region of a composite DNA transposon becomes mobile as well. Retrotransposons can be divided further into two groups: one with a long terminal repeat (LTR) of a few hundred to over 1 kb long at each end (e.g., retroviruses) and the other without LTRs (e.g., long interspersed nuclear elements or LINEs) [2] . Retroviruses and LINEs encode reverse transcriptases that are essential for their amplification in the genome. In most cases, insertion of either a DNA transposon or a retrotransposon results in target site duplication (TSD) of usually 2-20 bp [1, 2] .

Complete DA/Xiao copies were found to have an architecture resembling bacterial composite DNA transposon Tn9, consisting of a middle region (the core) flanked by two elements that are direct repeats of each other. The only exception to this is that the flanking element is a modified HERV-E rather than a DNA transposon [13] . However, barring this structural resemblance, there is no experimental evidence that could determine whether DA and Xiao are indeed composite LTR-retrotransposons. Consequently, it is currently unclear whether they have propagated in the genome via retrotransposition or by other mechanisms. Xiao, with a core of 10 kb, was found to originate from a region of chromosome 19p encoding olfactory receptor 7E members [13] [14] [15] . DA, with a core of ~260 kb, appears to have evolved from a Xiao that had an extra LTR5B element, which likely evolved from an ancestral Xiao via insertion of a HERV-K that later degenerated to a solo LTR [13] . The evolvement of DA, according to our analyses [13] , was accomplished by insertion of ~200 kb of chimeric sequence derived from chromosomes 16p and 21q into the Xiao core, followed by insertion of 56 kb of TEs and retrogenes.

In addition, structural analyses indicated three types of DA existing in the genome: type I DA is the most ancestral form (found in the human, chimp, and orangutan genomes); type II has an HERV-E inserted into an existing HERV-H, while type III has a sequence duplication of ~100 kb derived from chromosome 8p and is the most recently evolved (found in the chimp and human genomes only) [13] .

Based on their architecture, we designed primers that are specific to each type of duplicon for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. As shown in Fig. 2a , \"standalone Xiaos\" (those that are not associated with DAs in the genome) do not have an LTR5B element (solo LTR of HERV-K). This is unlike the \"Insertion-ready Xiao\" which, based on our previous analyses [13] , is likely to have evolved from a \"standalone Xiao\" by acquiring a HERV-K insertion (which later degenerates to a solo LTR), due to the fact that the donor sequence has neither LTR5B nor HERV-K at the corresponding position. We therefore used the pre-insertion site of LTR5B (HERV-K, to be more precise) to design primers that can only amplify the standalone Xiaos but cannot amplify those Xiao regions inside DAs. Type I DAs appear to have evolved from a LTR5Bcontaining Xiao via insertion of three sequence fragments derived from chromosomes 16p and 21q into the Xiao core [13] (which is why this Xiao is called \"Insertion-ready Xiao\" in Fig. 2 ). Consequently, we designed four pairs of primers flanking both insertion junctions, as well as the two 16p and 21q chimeric sequence fusion junctions (Fig.  2a) , to amplify Type I DAs in primate genomes. Compared to type I DAs, type II DAs have an extra HERV-H/ HERV-E/HERV-H element (formed by insertion of a HERV-E into an existing HERV-H). Thus, primers were designed flanking the right HERV-E/HERV-H junction, which we found to only exist inside DAs via comparison of the junction sequence with the entire human genome. Finally, given that type III DAs have an additional 100 kb sequence duplication derived from chromosome 8p, primers were designed to span the 16p/8p chimeric sequence fusion junction (Fig. 2a) . We also ensured that each primer was not copy-specific and that its sequence was common (with a few base mismatches/gaps allowed) to nearly all copies of a duplicon type.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 64, "end": 68, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 528, "end": 532, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1113, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 313, "end": 320, "text": "Fig. 2a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1180, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1343, "text": "(Fig.  2a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1900, "text": "(Fig. 2a)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Age determination of Xiao as well as type I, type II and type III DAs by examining their internal junctions"}, {"text": "Age of Xiao and three types of DA With the primers described above, we performed PCR experiments with the primate species indicated in Fig. 1 , with each experiment repeated multiple times.

Thus, the PCR amplification results with the New World monkey and lemur DNA were expected to be negative for most of our primers. Thus, these species could serve as negative controls in our PCR experiments to a certain extent, while the human served as a positive control). However, type II and type III DAs could be amplified only with the human, chimp, bonobo and gorilla genomic DNA but not with that of other primates.

These observations are consistent with the hypothesis described above, stating that DA and Xiao had depended upon the HERV-E machinery to proliferate in the genome. However, the enormous size of DA and Xiao (300 kb and 30 kb respectively) certainly raises questions regarding this hypothesis, as retroviruses including HERVs are below 12 kb and the longest known RNA viruses (corona viruses) are only ~30 kb. Even if the hypothesis is proven to indeed be true, some novel mechanisms which are different from that of HERVs must have been used.
