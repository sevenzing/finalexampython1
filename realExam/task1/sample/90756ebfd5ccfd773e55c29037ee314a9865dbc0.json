The main barriers noted in the literature include: security concerns, trust and privacy, a lack of personalization and limited technical knowledge of the elderly. Significant enablers that may be considered are: perceived ease of use of mobile banking applications, perceived value, convenience and consumer attitudes. Future directions for research and practice on mobile banking for the elderly are suggested.",

Mobile commerce and as such mobile banking removes spatial and temporal limitations, enabling customers to conduct ubiquitous payments [1] and to shop globally. The driver behind mobile electronic offerings such as mobile banking and commerce was to enable the suppliers to reach a wider audience at an affordable and convenient level, while increasing their revenue at the same time. The elderly population, in particular, may gain powerful assistance through having mobile applications and m-commerce on hand for their daily requirements [2] .",

The youth are reported to be leading in technology usage whereas the elderly are reportedly lagging. It is important that various customer groups are afforded an equal opportunity to benefit from online public and private services [4] especially in the digital era. Research has reported the exclusion of the elderly in as far as the deployment of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) [4, 5] . Unfortunately, the case of the elderly's digital inclusion seems to receive little attention. Digital barriers can be a factor behind the exclusion of the elderly [6] . The digital inclusion of the elderly could positively impact on the social and economic welfare for this segment of the population subsequently improving their quality of life [7] . It is worth mentioning that the current elderly people are not digital natives. Thus, if the users have a limited understanding or familiarity of any given technology, it is likely that they will not use the products offered through that technology [8] .",

Nonetheless, Shaikh and Karjaluoto [11] argue that accessing banking or financial services from a laptop should not be considered m-banking, since the user interface is similar to that of desktop PCs. According to Touchaie and Hashim [12] , m-banking is the act of conducting monetary transactions in a mobile environment, using mobile or wireless network and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Mobile payments are considered a subset of mobile banking. Houghton [13] considered paying for your car fuel or parkade tickets through vending machine via smartphone's credits as a payment method to be an example of m-commerce. Some authors refer to it as cellphone banking. Mlitwa and Tshetsha [14] described it as a convenient banking channel to manage finances using a mobile phone. According to Al-jabri and Sohail [15] , mobile banking services allow customers to take full advantage of the latest technology which enables them to: check account details; view a mini-statement; transfer funds; pay credit cards and loan installments and place remittances to beneficiaries in local banks or abroad, to highlight a few.",

Khan, Varshney and Qadeer [18] suggested that it is mobile commerce (m-commerce), they continued to define it as buying and selling of goods and services using wireless technology. Khan, Varshney and Qadeer further identified mobile banking as one of the products and services available in the mobile commerce (m-commerce). Thus, mobile financial services fall under this umbrella such as mobile personal banking and payments [19] . Mobile banking is currently available via SMS technology and WAP-enabled mobile phones [20, 21] . The capability to use banking and other m-commerce applications with such a small device effectively with good interaction is a critical success factors of mobile buying and selling [22] . Mobility is often a challenge for a number of elderly individuals. Thus mobile shopping and banking can be beneficial to this cohort who would then essentially not have to leave their homes or comfort to perform financial transactions [1] .",

Considering the disadvantaged background, change in political structures for these countries does not culminate in economic power or wealth [23] . Also, poverty is evident in such countries and the digital technologies and other (ICT) infrastructure are still under development [13] . Thus, low-cost banking may benefit citizens in these countries. Some researchers have indicated that mobile technology can reduce the effect of poverty [47] . However, it is unclear if people in low-income countries will adopt mobile banking technology [26] , since the appetite for banking services in these countries is not high.

Even though the SLR approach requires more effort compared to other approaches [51] , it matched the requirement of the study which was to understand what is known in the scholarly literature about the barriers and enablers for the elderly regarding mobile commerce and banking. The approach adopted in this study, looked at the published papers in the last 10 years (2009-2019), focusing on the association between mobile banking, m-commerce and the elderly in developing countries. The following search terms and combinations were used in this systematic review: (Mobile banking OR m-banking OR mbanking OR Mobile commerce OR Mcommerce OR mcommerce) AND (Elderly OR Senior citizen OR Seniors OR Older adults OR Older people) AND (Developing Countries). The electronic libraries did not yield much data on the phenomena of interest. Mobile banking is still emerging in several countries [33] , thus few studies were returned, and most did not contain the search text. The articles that did not contain the search text were omitted immediately. Due to a minimal number of relevant research studies returned, it was decided that research articles should not be limited only to developing countries but rather focus on elderly and mobile banking and m-commerce in general.",

Figure 1 highlights the process followed to select the papers. The studies were reviewed to extract the drivers and barriers towards mobile banking and commerce. The search resulted in 11 relevant publications, of which four were published in different journals and some published as part of conference proceedings and student dissertations. Based on the search results, only four of these research studies were conducted in the developing countries. The majority of the papers investigated adoption using a quantitative approach. The searches were conducted on ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Science Direct, ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar. Due to scarcity of research papers focusing on this context, the search was extended to the top eight IS Journals as identified by the Association for Information Systems (AIS). After reviewing the eight IS journals, there were no new articles identified which were relevant to the subject.",

The participants were non-users of mobile banking. A sample of 384 was obtained and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. It can be recorded that resistance to change is a barrier towards adoption of mobile banking. Marketing strategies used by online services providers such as mbanking were not appropriate to attract the market segment that is unwilling to use services such as senior market.

The results further revealed that the innovativeness of device and a product or service such as mobile banking needs to be compatible with individuals' lifestyles and also offer support service by way of its novelty. The author noted that, by offering support, the consumer perceived difficulties and complexities are often reduced or eliminated, consequently promoting trust while reducing risks. Focusing on trust, the study also introduced a conceptual framework which can be used for future studies. Lian and Yen [2] studied drivers and barriers affecting older consumers' intention to shop online. The study used UTAUT and innovation resistance theory. By comparing younger consumers with their older counterparts, and considering gender, the findings indicate that the major factors driving older adults toward online shopping are performance expectation and social influence which is the same with younger consumers. Their study revealed the following barriers: value, risk, and tradition which is different from younger users.",

Trust was a commonly cited barrier in the literature. Consumers have different views and attitude regarding mobile technologies which generate a number of issues when it comes to acceptance and adoption. In general factors such as a lack of trust of technology and a lack of technology readiness act as barriers to the adoption of mobile financial services [48] . The digital divide and digital literacy are two areas that also caught the attention of the researchers when considering the elderly as digital immigrants [41] . For instance, operating a small user interface of a mobile device may be difficult for the elderly. Also a mobile application with a complicated menu may be difficult for the elderly to remember [12] . While studies prove that elderly customers who have access to electronic services and products are ready for electronic banking and commerce [3] , the opposite is reported for mobile commercial products and services. Among barriers, the elderly reported professionally written instructions for operating devices which they did not understand and also the absence of a person who can teach them as key constraints. Additionally, fear is another reason for not using digital technologies. The elderly are afraid of being lost in smartphone or tablet and that they will not be able to login or sign out of the application [41] . Performing online payment is another issue for the elderly attempting to shop online, many consumers preferred cash on delivery due to trust and security issues [2] and privacy [55] .",

Mobile banking is still in the emerging stage in various parts of the world, thus future research should focus on building the body of knowledge around this context. There is a need to conduct research studies that adopt data collection methods that probe for answers, which can deliver rich primary data from the elderly. Additionally, the study found that there is a gap in research focusing on the elderly and mobile banking and commerce, which confirmed the findings of [33] . In the light of this, the opportunity for further studies is identified particularly from the perspective of developing countries. Future research should address this gap by focusing on how the elderly needs can be met in this digital era focusing on digital or technology needs.",

The growing numbers of elderly people globally signifies that there is an opportunity to market directly to this group or develop products customized for this segment. However, to customize services for this segment group, enablers and barriers need to be understood, hence the need for research studies in this area of interest. Even though there are barriers, it can be argued that, with time, the elderly will become more interested in mobile commerce and banking to enhance their quality of life. Banks need to communicate to their consumers the measures they will employ to address the elderly issues and concerns being raised [55] . Thus, ICT practitioners and researchers need to propose age-specific design guidelines for mobile devices and mobile applications [34] . Furthermore, in-house training and usage guidance would prove to be useful to this vulnerable group [40] .",
