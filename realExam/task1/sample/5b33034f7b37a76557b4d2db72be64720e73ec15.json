This puts lymphocyte cytotoxicity to the center of immune regulation and maintenance of T-cell quiescence, far beyond its activity in virus control. A better understanding of the initiation of immune reactions in HLH and the role of perforin and the secretory pathway in controlling them will therefore be highly relevant for understanding the regulation of human immune responses.
