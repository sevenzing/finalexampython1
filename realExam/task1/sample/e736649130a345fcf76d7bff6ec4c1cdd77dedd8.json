Initially, a lot of cases of unknown etiology regarding pneumonia were reported. Reported patients worked or lived near the local Huanan seafood wholesales market. Associated symptoms are acute respiratory infection and, in some patients, rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS), severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), acute respiratory failure, and other serious complication. Mild symptoms are seen in most patients with good prognosis. A lot of casualties are reported of those patients having symptoms of severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or multiple organ failure. Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified novel coronavirus on January 7, from throat swab sample of a patient. World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus as 2019-nCoV.

In humans, there are six previously reported human coronaviruses that can be transmitted between humans, which are responsible for causing mild upper respiratory disorders.

This type of drug development would provide the first line of defense against future emerging CoV-associated ailments like SARS. Development of wide-spectrum drugs requires possible conserved target sequence within whole genus coronavirus. For identifying the possible potent target, extensive research was done and Mpro (molecular weight 34 kDa) was identified as targeted protease, overall controlling RNA replication and transcription. Mpro is the main CoV protease, sharing highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparing four crystal structures. Homology model also represents all three genetic clusters of genus coronavirus. CoV genome sequence mutates with high frequency [8] . For all known RNA viruses, coronaviruses have the largest genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb in length. Apart from encoding structural proteins, the major portion of the viral genome is transcribed and translated into a polypeptide that ultimately encodes for those essential proteins involving in viral reapplication and genome expression. The~306 aa length protease is also encoded by polypeptide, and this polypeptide is processed finally into a functional protein. Picornavirus and Mpro shares similar cleavagesite specificity, so this Mpro is also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Extensive research showed that Mpro from different coronaviruses is highly conserved in terms of 3D structure and structure, which is why Mpro is a potential target for designing anti-coronaviral drug [9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 909, "end": 912, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1704, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Bioinformatics that is an interdisciplinary field of mathematics, science, and computer science provides very meaningful results regarding the analysis of exome sequencing [10] .
