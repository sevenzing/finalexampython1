This chapter will review the common respiratory viral agents in infants and young children, including epidemiology and clinical and radiographic features.

A brief summary of each of the major infantile respiratory viruses is provided, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfl uenza virus, adenovirus, and infl uenza virus, as well as the more recently detected and increasingly signifi cant lower respiratory tract viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus. Congenital and neonatal forms of viral pneumonia, such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and measles virus, are also discussed. Postinfectious complications of viral bronchiolitis are included in this chapter due to the signifi cant persistent morbidity during infancy in many patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Brief Introduction"}, {"text": "Infantile respiratory viral illnesses have become an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in populations 0-2 years of age, with approximately 300,000 pediatric hospital admissions annually in the United States and estimated hospital costs ranging from $140 to $800 million annually (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ; Coffi n 2005 ; Hustedt and Vazquez 2010 ; Smuts et al. 2008 ) . Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are a leading indication for hospitalization (2-3 %) in young children. Approximately 90 % of LRTI in children are viral, in contrast to adults, in whom approximately 12 % of community-acquired LRTIs have a viral etiology (Hammond et al. 2007 ; Chong et al. 2009 ; Welliver 2003 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 289, "end": 319, "text": "(Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 320, "end": 334, "text": "Coffi n 2005 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 335, "end": 361, "text": "Hustedt and Vazquez 2010 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 362, "end": 381, "text": "Smuts et al. 2008 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 648, "end": 670, "text": "(Hammond et al. 2007 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 671, "end": 690, "text": "Chong et al. 2009 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 691, "end": 706, "text": "Welliver 2003 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Common Viruses in Infancy"}, {"text": "The most common pathologic viruses in infancy include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfl uenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), infl uenza virus (InfV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and less so coronavirus (CoV), rhinovirus (RhV), and bocavirus (BoV) (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ; Hammond et al. 2007 ; Chong et al. 2009 ). RSV remains the most prevalent and most severe of the neonatal LRTI's (Coffi n 2005 ; Hammond et al. 2007 ; Chong et al. 2009 ; Chang et al. 2009 ; Fitzgerald 2011 ) . Studies indicate that 20-67 % of children less than 1 year of age will be infected by RSV, with infection rates up to 95 % by age 2 years (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ; Hammond et al. 2007 ; Fitzgerald 2011 ; Johnson et al. 2007 ) . PIV commonly occurs within the fi rst 6 months of life with 50 % of patients affected by the fi rst year of life (Hammond et al. 2007 ) . Recently updated diagnostic technologies, including multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, have offered more accurate and faster diagnostic methods allowing appropriate treatments and patient management. Importantly, PCR for DNA viruses and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for RNA viruses also have allowed identifi cation of viruses which are difficult to culture, such as hMPV and BoV, allowing better delineation of multi-agent respiratory viral infections (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ) . The most common synchronously occurring respiratory viruses are RSV and RhV (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ; Chong et al. 2009 ; Garcia et al. 2010 ). In the last decade, hMPV, BoV, CoV, and RhV are increasingly recognized as causes of lower respiratory viral infections in children (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010 ) . Together, hMPV and BoV account for approximately 13 % of previously undiagnosable acute respiratory infections (Hustedt and Vazquez 2010 ) .

In particular, the highest risk of mortality is associated with respiratory viral infection in premature neonates less than 1,500 g birth weight, with a reported mortality rate of 30 per 100,000 live births (Coffi n 2005 ). The mechanisms for increased susceptibility in this population include inadequate immunologic defenses against infection, possibly due to a lack of immune experience and diminished transfer or maternal antibodies in utero, incomplete development of the neonatal airways and chest musculature, and decreased cardiopulmonary reserve due to chronic lung disease (Hammond et al. 2007 ; Welliver 2003 ; Papenburg and Boivin 2010 ) . Chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease are both predictors of prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality due to viral bronchiolitis (Papenburg and Boivin 2010 ) . Epidemiologic data suggests that American Indians and Alaskan Natives have a disproportionately higher mortality rate and hospitalization rate due to bronchiolitis, compared to both African Americans and Caucasians (Chang et al. 2009 ; Singleton et al. 2009 ).

The nasopharyngeal aspirate can be analyzed by direct immunofl uorescence (IF) study, enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA), RT-PCR, and viral culture (Coffi n 2005 ; Fitzgerald 2011 ; Marcos et al. 2009 ).

A combination of direct viral injury to the epithelium and immunologic damage is responsible for pathologic changes, exacerbated by underdeveloped immunity and immature airways (Tregoning and Schwarze 2010 ; Coffi n 2005 ) . Histologically, respiratory viruses typically cause a pattern of lymphocytic bronchiolitis, with or without interstitial pneumonitis. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is recognized by the presence of a circumferential cuff of airway-centered lymphocytes and macrophages, in some cases associated with secondary epithelial necrosis and sloughing, and plugging of bronchioles by fi brin and mucus. Squamous metaplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium and surrounding airspaces may be prominent in the healing phase of injury. Interstitial lymphocytic infl ammatory infi ltrates (pneumonitis) may be present, despite the fact that direct viral infection of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes is only variably demonstrated (Coffi n 2005 ; Hammond et al. 2007 ; Welliver 2003 ) .

Clinically, RSV infection of the upper respiratory tract causes coryza, cough, hoarseness, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. Acute otitis media is a frequent complication. Lower respiratory tract infection due to RSV results in a syndrome of bronchiolitis (65 %) or pneumonia (21 %) and less commonly croup (11 %) or asthma exacerbation (3 %) (Williams et al. 2004 ).

Neutrophilic infi ltration centers on the bronchioles, whereas mononuclear infi ltration affects both bronchioles and parenchyma. As with other viruses, airway obstruction results from epithelial and infl ammatory cell debris mixed with fi brin, mucus, and edema, compounded by extrinsic compression of bronchioles by hyperplastic lymphoid follicles (Johnson et al. 2007 ).
