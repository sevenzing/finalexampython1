It is a longstanding question whether there exists an infinite word w over a finite subset of N that avoids additive squares (additive 2nd powers) [3, 4, 6] . One motivation for studying this problem is that a positive answer to this question would imply that additive squares are avoidable over any semigroup that contains some finitely generated infinite semigroup [6] (an application of van der Waerden's theorem shows that additive powers are not avoidable over any other semigroup [4] ). Cassaigne et al. [1] showed that there exists an infinite word over the finite alphabet {0, 1, 3, 4} \u2282 Z without additive cubes (additive 3rd powers).
