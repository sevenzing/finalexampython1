This study presents a 5-year retrospective analysis of patients injured due to train-associated events, managed at a level-1 trauma center in India. Materials and methods Hospital-based trauma registry data of train-associated injuries presenting between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Data from 726 patients were analyzed for demographics, injury events, injury regions, their management and outcomes. ISS and NISS were used to quantify the injury severity. Results Mean age was 33 years, with male-to-female ratio 86 to 14%. The majority of patients (62%) were between 20-40 years. The median ISS was 9 (IQR 4-16), median hospital stays 11 days (IQR6-23), with in-hospital mortality of 17.4%. Presence of head injury; ISS [ 9 and CPR in ED were independent risk factors of mortality. Trespassers on the rail track had significantly more severe injuries compared to passengers (Median ISS 13 vs. 9, p = 0.012; Median NISS 22 vs.17, p = 0.015); however, mortality and hospital length of stay were not significantly different. Location of injury event (on platform or tracks) showed no difference between the severity of injuries, mortality and hospital length of stay. Conclusions Current study reports comprehensive injury patterns and outcomes of train-associated injuries from a low-and middle-income country (LMIC). Apart from the mortality, there is a high incidence of permanent disabilities from extremity amputations. No significant difference was noted in the severity and outcomes among patients injured on or off train platforms, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety measures including enforcement and promoting safe behavior not only on locations like train tracks but equally at platforms.

However, an autopsy study by Rautji et al. from the same institute has reported that 17.4% of decedents of train injuries had ethanol in their blood [10] .

High amputation rates(17-94%) have been reported in the literature for train-associated injuries, relative to other mechanisms of injury.

There is also no linkage of judiciary data with medical records. In developed countries, most of the injuries recorded are deliberate, constituting more than two-third fatalities among all train-associated injuries. Virdee et al. reported that mortality rates between the accidental and intentional injury groups were almost the same, highlighting that those who attempt railway suicide are not more likely to die [13] . Limosin et al. showed that regardless of location or intent, train-associated injuries are caused by similar mechanisms and can be regarded as 'person hit by train' events leading to the same severe consequences [14] . This analysis comes with a perspective that any preventive measure directed for one mechanism will work for others as well, at least partially. Platform screen door (PSD) installation at platforms is one such intervention.

Saskya et al. reported 9.8% in-hospital mortality in patients hit by the train and showed no difference in mortality compared with patients hit by an automobile [7] . In another study by Cocks RA, it reported that 35% of the patient cohort of train injuries died before reaching the hospital, with another 15.4% dying following admission to hospital [17] . Interestingly, our in-patient mortality rate is slightly higher than these reports as it does not take into account the large cohort of patients who were transferred out to other hospitals and were having a significantly less severe injury (mean ISS 6) than the admitted patients. In comparison with other injury mechanisms, patients with train-associated injuries are having higher chances of mortality. Deepa et al., in their analysis of 16,047 trauma patients, showed that railway injuries had 2.1 adjusted odds ratio for 30-day mortality compared to 1.4 for road traffic injuries [18] .

Many of these individuals used the railway tracks as a place to socialize, walk or rest. In developing countries, the railway tracks are frequently used as pedestrian paths in the absence of bridges, subways and other suitable road crossings. In our study, both groups had almost equal mortality, which may be due to overcrowding, illegal traveling on carriage footsteps, and rooftops, which is a common occurrence in India posing additional risk to passengers.
