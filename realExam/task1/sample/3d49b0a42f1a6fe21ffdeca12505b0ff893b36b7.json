Intestinal enteroids, which partially recreate the structure and function of intestinal villi-crypts, have many physiological similarities to the intestinal tissues in vivo. Enteroids exhibit advantages in studying the interactions between intestines and enteric pathogens. To create a novel infection model for PDCoV, we developed an in vitro system to generate porcine intestinal enteroids from crypts of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of pigs. Enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, stem cells, proliferating cells, and goblet cells were found in the differentiated enteroids. Replication of PDCoV was detected in the cultured enteroids by immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that PDCoV was present in Sox9-positive intestinal cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. There were multiple cellular responses shown as changes of transcription of genes related to mucosal immunity, antiviral genes, and marker genes of stem cells and other cells in the enteroids infected with PDCoV. We conclude that the 2-D enteroids derived from porcine jejunum can be used as an in vitro multicellular model for the investigation of pathogenesis and host immune responses to porcine enteric pathogens, such as PDCoV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Porcine enteroviruses are a group of highly contagious pathogens that cause serious economic losses worldwide.

The culture method we established is relatively easy without the necessity of cellsorting steps. The quantity and purity of the separated crypts are high. In our culture method, the cultured PIEs are of almost 100% viability. A previous study has shown that the crypts from duodenum are relatively deeper compared with those from jejunum and ileum (Chwen et al., 2013) . This suggests that duodenum might have better renewal frequency and potential than other intestinal segments. Duodenum was reported as having the best in vitro culture efficiency (but without presentation of experimental data) (Zietek et al., 2015) . Our results support the conclusion that duodenum is superior to other segments probably as a result of expression of some specific genes in duodenum. A previous study has found different expression levels of the same genes located in different cells, although all cells are exposed to the same cytokines (Tsai et al., 2018) . In another study, transcription of genes specific in some intestinal segments was not affected by cell passaging, and this special expression patterns could maintain for 10 to 12 weeks.

In long-term epithelial cell cultures, enteroids from duodenum, jejunum, and ileum still have specific characteristics, even though all the cells are exposed to the same extracellular factors (Middendorp et al., 2014) . Similar to previous studies, the enteroids we cultured could live normally for 4 months with no anomalies in their growth, morphology, and pathogen infection rates during culture. Some studies reported that the enteroids could be cultured for more than 1 year with very little changes in characteristics as shown by single-cell sequencing (Fujii et al., 2018) . Thus, this kind of enteroid could be employed for further studies on different biological functions, as it has similar biological characteristics. The study of 3-D enteroids provides new inspiration for intestinal biology, but the relatively closed three-dimensional structure is an important practical limitation for biomedical research. For example, it is hard to perform quantitative analysis and viral infection, and it can also cause severe damage of enteroids proceeded micro-injection (Bartfeld and Clevers, 2015) . Thorne et al. (2018) have established a simple 2-D enteroid monolayer culture system, which can recapitulate many properties of the intestinal epithelium and 3-D organoids. The MPIEs we cultured could form a tight confluent monolayer in 3 days and allow the virus to easily enter from the apical surface of the mucosa. This is also important for studying cell signaling and cellular responses, as many receptors are differentially expressed in the apical and baso-lateral membranes, including transporters, Toll-like receptors, and cytokine receptors (Playford et al., 1996; Kesisoglou et al., 2010; Grenier et al., 2013; Cevallos Porta et al., 2016) . In addition, monolayer PIEs contain a repertoire of differentiated cell types and some progenitor cells. Human noroviruses (HuNoVs) can infect enterocytes , rotaviruses can infect enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells (Saxena et al., 2016) , and echovirus 11 preferentially infects enteroendocrine cells (Drummond et al., 2017) . Our results indicate that PDCoV can replicate in the Sox9 + cells and Villin1positive enterocytes. PDCoV has been found to locate mainly in the villi in the early stage of infection, but a small number could be present in crypts and Peyer's patch during the late stage of infection (Hu et al., 2016) . The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses functions as the key element for invasion into the cells by interaction with the receptor (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) and its activation is dependent on host cell proteases. This indicates that the stem cells and the absorptive enterocytes might possess the same or similar proteases. In short, MPIEs can be used as a system through which the enterovirus-gastrointestinal interactions can be simulated to reproduce the details of events associated with viral infections in vivo.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 346, "end": 371, "text": "(Middendorp et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 713, "end": 733, "text": "(Fujii et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1256, "text": "(Bartfeld and Clevers, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1279, "text": "Thorne et al.

So far, two ISC groups have been confirmed in the intestinal crypts, activated intestinal stem cells (aISCs) and reserved intestinal stem cells (rISCs). The gene markers of the aISCs include Lgr5, Ascl2, and Sox9. The rISCs are located in the \"+4 to +6\" position at the bottom of the crypts with BMI1 as the main marker.
