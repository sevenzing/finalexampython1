            "text": "Purpose: To evaluate the MOLES system for identifying malignancy in melanocytic choroidal tumors in patients treated for choroidal melanoma. Methods: Records of 615 patients treated for choroidal melanoma between January 2017 and December 2019 were reviewed. Patients were excluded if iris and/or ciliary body involvement (106 patients), inadequate fundus photography (26 patients), no images available for review (21 patients) and/or treatment was not primary (11 patients). Demographic data and AJCC TNM Stage were collected. Color fundus and autofluorescence photographs (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and B-scan ultrasounds were prospectively reviewed. MOLES scores were assigned according to five criteria: mushroom shape, orange pigment, large size, enlarging tumor and subretinal fluid. Results: A total of 451 patients (mean age, 63.9 \u00b1 13.9 years) were included. At treatment, mean largest basal tumor diameter (LBD) and thickness were 10.3 \u00b1 2.8 mm (range, 3.0-23.0) and 4.3 mm (range, 1.0-17.0). All but one (0.2%) had MOLES scores of \u22653. Eighty-two patients were treated after surveillance lasting a mean of 1.5 years. Initially, most (63/82; 76.8%) had a MOLES score \u2265 3. Importantly, none of the 451 tumors had a score of <2, and as such, the MOLES protocol would have indicated referral to an ocular oncologist for 100% of patients. Conclusion: The MOLES scoring system is a sensitive (99.8%) tool for indicating malignancy in melanocytic choroidal tumors (MOLES \u2265 3). If the examining practitioner can recognize the five features suggestive of malignancy, MOLES is a safe tool to optimize referral of melanocytic choroidal tumors for specialist care.",

As choroidal melanomas are infrequently seen in non-subspecialty clinics, up to one third of patients referred to an ocular oncology center for uveal melanoma are found to have a simulating lesion, most commonly a choroidal nevus [1, 2] , which often has minimal risk of malignancy. At the same time, patients with melanoma frequently experience long delays in referral and diagnosis because their tumor is incorrectly classified as a 'suspicious nevus', in many instances because the referring clinician is falsely reassured by its relatively small size. As a result, some patients suffer greater ocular morbidity, visual loss, and perhaps and increased risk of metastasis that may have been prevented by timely referral and treatment.",

Several of these risk factors were confirmed by Shields et al., who devised a well-known mnemonic 'To Find Small Ocular Melanoma' [7, 8] later adding 'Using Helpful Hints Daily.' [9, 10] . As recent years have seen advances in multi-modal imaging techniques, this mnemonic has been revised to 'To Find Small Ocular Melanoma Doing IMaging,' with the 'M' representing 'Melanoma hollow' on ultrasound and 'DIM' representing 'diameter > 5 mm' on fundus photography [11] .",

            "text": "The MOLES acronym stands for: Mushroom shape, Orange pigment, Large size, Enlarging tumor and Subretinal fluid. Each of these features is given a score of 0, 1 or 2 according to whether it is absent, borderline, or present. These five features were selected with the aim of making MOLES a highly sensitive, safe scoring system. Mushroom shape is almost pathognomonic for choroidal melanoma. It is included in the MOLES scoring system to ensure that even in the absence of other features, patients with mushroom shaped choroidal lesions will be appropriately referred. Although overlying lipofuscin can be seen in a variety of choroidal pathologies, numerous studies have found orange pigment to be an important risk factor for melanocytic lesion [4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11] . The mean largest basal diameter of choroidal nevi documented in the Blue Mountain Eye Study was only 1.25 mm [12] , only 13% of nevi are > 5.5 mm [13] and thickness > 2 mm is associated with a significant risk of future growth [8, 9, 11] . Therefore, large size is included as the third feature in an effort to ensure that the MOLES score reliably identifies otherwise bland lesions that are suspicious primarily because their size. Fourthly, although choroidal nevi may enlarge slowly over a long period of time (0.06 mm/year) [14] , a more rapid rate of growth (mean 1.0 mm/year, range 0.0-8.0 mm/year) [9] is indicative of malignant transformation. Finally, the presence of sub-retinal fluid is included as the fifth feature as it has also previously been well documented as a risk factor for growth [4, 5, 7, [9] [10] [11] . A multivariable analysis of 2355 cases by Shields et al. confirmed the predictive value of orange pigment (p = 0.0004), tumor thickness (p < 0.0001), basal tumor diameter (p = 0.0275), and subretinal fluid (p< 0.0001) [11] . The MOLES scoring system categorizes tumors as 'common nevus', 'low-risk-nevus', 'high-risk nevus' and 'probable melanoma' according to whether the sum total of these five scores is 0, 1, 2 or >2 respectively. The MOLES protocol advises patients with common nevi to undergo review by a community optometrist every two years, ideally with sequential color photography. For the remaining patients, multimodal imaging assessed by an ophthalmologist is recommended, with referral for such care considered non-urgent for patients with low-risk or high-risk nevi and urgent for patients with probable melanoma. Studies at Oxford Eye Hospital and the Ocular Oncology Service at Moorfields Eye Hospital have shown that a significant proportion of patients referred to these centers have common or low-risk nevi. If managed entirely in the community, these patients, many of whom are elderly, would be spared the cost and inconvenience of having to travel to hospital eye clinics, which may be far from their home. The transfer of care to community optometrists would lighten the burden on hospital clinics, reducing waiting lists and freeing up resources for patients in greater need of urgent specialist care.",

Confluent clumps of orange pigment (Figure 3) , which should readily be seen with ophthalmoscopy or color photography, are given a score of 2, with a score of 1 reserved for subtle dusting (Figure 4) .

With MOLES, tumor thickness > 2mm is given a score of 2 because it is associated with the most significant hazard ratio out of all the risk factors for growth at five years. [11] A study by Augsburger et al. indicates that there are 125 choroidal nevi for every melanoma in the thickness range of 1.5 to 2 mm, 25 nevi for every melanoma in the thickness range of 2 to 2.5 mm, and 5 nevi for every melanoma in the thickness range of 2.5 to 3 mm, approximately [22] .",

Without OCT and US, it can be difficult to estimate tumor thickness; however, MOLES minimizes this problem by combining thickness with diameter when categorizing size, because it is rare for melanocytic tumors to grow in thickness without also increasing in diameter. Although choroidal nevi and melanomas overlap significantly with respect to size [22] , the discriminatory function of MOLES is enhanced by considering other indicators of malignancy.",

Based on this, Harbour devised the acronym 'DOCTOR GASS', which represents: Drusen, Overlying retinal degeneration, Chronic RPE changes, Thickness > 2 mm, Orange pigment, Reflectivity (low) on ultrasonography, Girth (diameter) of tumor, Angiographic hot spots, Subretinal fluid, and Symptoms [5] . Several of these signs were confirmed by Shields et al., who devised a well-known mnemonic 'To Find Small Ocular Melanoma', which represented Thickness, Fluid, Symptoms, Orange pigment, and Margin near optic disc [7, 8] later adding 'Using Helpful Hints Daily.' to represent Ultrasound hollowness, Halo absence and Drusen absence [9, 10] . As recent studies showed margin near the disc, absence of drusen and absence of halo to be statistically insignificant, Shields et al. revised this mnemonic to 'To Find Small Ocular Melanoma Doing IMaging,' with the 'M' representing 'Melanoma hollow on ultrasound' and 'DIM' representing 'diameter > 5 mm' on fundus photography [11] Unlike the TFSOM mnemonic and the DOCTOR GASS acronym, MOLES scoring does not require assessment of internal acoustic reflectivity by ultrasonography. Additionally, whereas TFSOM ascribes an all-or-none value to each of its clinical signs, MOLES scores include an intermediate value for features that are borderline, subtle or uncertain. We feel this additional category will be especially useful in the community, where findings are more likely to be inconclusive because of limited experience or equipment.",

Previous studies evaluating optometric referrals found that triage via teleophthalmology reduced office visits to retina specialists by 48%, saving patients cost and time associated with travel and improving efficiency of clinical examination and testing for those requiring treatment [29] . A preliminary assessment of our unpublished data suggests that a similar percentage of referrals for choroidal melanocytic lesions may be avoided by implementing the MOLES scoring system.
