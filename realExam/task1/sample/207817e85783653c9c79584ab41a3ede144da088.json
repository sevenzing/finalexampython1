During the delay phase, over half of women (50.7%, 36/71) worried about their health often or all the time. Pregnant women had heightened anxiety regarding their older relatives' health (83.3%,55/66).

Almost half of women questioned (46.5%, 33/71) altered their primary method of transportation. Bulk-buying was reported by many participants (66.2% food, 42.3% Hand sanitizer, 25.4% toiletries, 9.9% fuel, 8.5% protective personal equipment).

Women are most concerned about older relatives, then their children, followed by their unborn child. Our patients are least concerned about their own health, but despite this, over half of women have significant health anxiety. Government instruction on social distancing has resulted in major changes in behaviour among pregnant patients. Pregnant women being under additional pressure may have indirect adverse effects on their physical and mental health. It is critical to recognise this and support patients through the provision of accurate and up-todate information, with simple strategies such as in this study leading to improved patient satisfaction and empowerment. Television news bulletins remain the most utilised source of information. Few patients used twitter or other social media as information sources, which is reassuring given the concerns over distribution of misinformation through social media. This data can be used to guide public health strategy regarding patient anxieties, changes in behaviour and health information sources, revealing the highest yield platforms to relay health messages to patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dear Editor"}, {"text": "None Declaration of Competing Interest", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Financial Disclaimers/ Declaration of Competing Interest"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Pan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "X", "middle": [], "last": "Wan", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2020, "venue": "Int J Environ Res Public Health", "volume": "17", "issn": "5", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Treating health anxiety: a cognitive approach", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Taylor", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Asmundson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Covid-19).
