Traditional workflow with GME usually depends on the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and use satellite image as a ground-texture. The virtual terrain and the textural fineness are limited by the resolution of the DEM and the satellite image, respectively. Unfortunately, this method cannot meet the observing needs of geoscience at the outcrop and specimen scale. Figure 5 gives the process of producing terrain. First, the DEM data ( Figure 5B ) is used to stretch out the 3D surface, and then the satellite image texture ( Figure 5A ) is attached to the 3D surface. However, the resolution of the satellite image is too low and can only be manually replenished with texture information. Figure 5C is the final model and Figure 5D is the close-up view of the model. In Figure 5D , it can be observed that the terrain lacks details and the texture was repeated and false. Limited to GME, many virtual geosciences teaching systems cannot provide real terrain and rock models ( Figure 6 ) [17] . Fake terrain and stretched texture are not problematic in video games, but they cause a severe problem in geoscience education or libraries. The real models based on true geoscience knowledge are critical for both digital archiving and education.
