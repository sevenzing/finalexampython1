There are early reports of high levels of concern amongst health professionals and others (Druss, 2020 , Ayanian, 2020 submitted). A feature of MindSpot is the routine measurement of symptoms at assessment, during treatment and at follow up using validated self-report scales that are sensitive to change, and importantly, the distribution of MindSpot users closely matches that of the population of Australia. On 19 th March 2020, one week after the World Health Organization confirmed COVID-19 as a pandemic, additional questions specific to COVID-19, were added to the online MindSpot assessment. Hence the data collected by MindSpot on large samples of people from all over Australia provides an opportunity to evaluate the early psychological effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and may assist in service planning.

In response, we have increased the number of staff responding to telephone calls and have developed websitebased and other materials to direct consumers to other more relevant services, as well as providing practical information to support people to maintain resilience. Based on patient reports we have also developed clinical guides to prepare therapists to respond to patient concerns. Reports from our therapists indicate that existing patients with chronic forms of anxiety and depression have reported feeling overwhelmed at first, but that they have recognised the need to practice psychological coping skills that are shown to be helpful in managing anxiety and depression. We expect that there will be a need to create additional resources as the pandemic unfolds, as the early indications are that infections have been contained in Australia for now, and new challenges emerge, in particular economic uncertainty.
