Local authorities were not yet observing dysfunctions in public services and may have attributed the increase in deaths to a random spike. Also, in our understanding, the growth in daily mortality rate by municipality or province was not an indicator included in the monitoring system of the flu. Italy has a rather sophisticated monitoring system for the flu (Influnet) which collects information from doctors, laboratories and the population on a weekly basis to monitor the development of flu epidemics in real time. These indicators are reviewed on a weekly basis and constitute the main source of information for a weekly report prepared by the flu surveillance system [6] .

We recommend therefore to monitor this indicator in real time and, as a rule of thumb, use a 100% increase in the death rate at the provincial level as an early warning signal. In particular, generating the growth rate in mortality by age and gender can provide some early indications that this growth is related to COVID-19.
