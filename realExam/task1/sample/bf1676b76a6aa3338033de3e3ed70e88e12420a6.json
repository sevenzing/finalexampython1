After taking the medical history, the patient signed a form promising to disclose their medical history without any concealment; otherwise, the patient will bear legal responsibility.

If negative, the patient was transferred to the general ward for 2-3 days.

Fifth, hospitalized patients wore masks at all times, and visitors as well as exchanges with other patients were strictly prohibited.

            "text": ". Lucia Bonomi and colleagues presented a patient with metastatic lung cancer died rapidly after infecting COVID-19 2 . Marco Russano and colleagues believed that tumor patients had a higher risk of lethal COVID-19 complications 3 . These seem not good news for COVID-19 patients combined with cancer. Therefore, the dramatic COVID-19 outbreak requires extreme caution on not only the covid-19 misdiagnosed as lung cancer, but also the inclusion of covid-19 in patients with lung cancer. However, the high-resolution CT findings of some COVID-19 patients are dominated by GGO-like changes, and these patients can even have only one localized lesion, with vacuoles, pleural traction, and the invasion of pulmonary capillaries 4 . These observations are highly consistent with the classic CT signs of lung cancer. How to differentiate lung cancer from COVID-19 is a challenge in Wuhan, where the outbreak is currently controlled and the number of early-stage lung cancer and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients is increasing 5 . This adds to the problem of identifying those with asymptomatic COVID-19. Doctors' concerns are twofold: first, patients with COVID-19 are being mistakenly treated for lung cancer, and these individuals could undergo an unnecessary operation. Second, patients with lung cancer with COVID-19 during the perioperative period can experience severe complications or nosocomial infection events.",
