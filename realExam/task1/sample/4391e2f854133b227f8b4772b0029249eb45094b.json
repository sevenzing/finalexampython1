It has produced an extraordinary level of disruption and a recognition that the future will be much more unpredictable than the past. Healthcare will never be the same.",

But when things become unstable, leaders are more successful in sub-optimizing what is currently working and instead of being willing to try new things and take risks. There are often no instructions or playbook on how to best proceed in chaotic environments where cause and effect is unclear.",

Winston Churchill is noted for his observation that we should never let a crisis go to waste.
