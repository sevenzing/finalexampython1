In this final chapter, the same scene is examined from the opposite aspect, namely, a focus in turn on each of the major clinical syndromes. Of course, this is not a textbook of medicine nor even of infectious diseases, but of virology. Thus space cannot be devoted to the detailed clinical descriptions of viral diseases and certainly not to any differential diagnosis from diseases caused by non-viral infectious agents, nor to the clinical management of infected patients. Appropriate reference works on infectious diseases have been listed under Further Reading. What follows is intended to provide only a bird's-eye view of the commoner syndromes so that the contribution of particular viruses to each one may be assessed. As the clinical features as well as the pathogenesis and epidemiology of all the major human viral infections were dealt with in the previous 23 chapters, this final chapter should be regarded as little more than an appendix which brings all these virus-disease associations together in a number of summary tables for ready reference.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "First, however, the question is considered as to whether our bodies carry \"normal viral flora,\" analogous to the bacterial microbiome. Particularly since the advent of molecular diagnostic and investigative techniques, and the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it has become more apparent that there are a number of different viruses, belonging to many different families, that can be regularly isolated from healthy individuals and that either are not known to cause disease or do so only under particular circumstances. These may represent lifelong persistent infections, or their presence may be due to an ultimately self-limiting, asymptomatic acute infection with prolonged excretion. Some are bacteriophages associated with gut bacteria. Some may even be animal viruses whose presence is due to the consumption of contaminated food. The composition of this virome is likely to vary between individuals, and over time in the same individual, and will be affected by the environmental exposure to exogenous viruses, and the age and immunocompetence of the host. As with the bacterial microbiome, some of these normally harmless commensal agents may be pathogenic under particular circumstances, for example, immunosuppression. Also similarly to the bacterial microbiome, discovery of one of these agents during disease or in a normally sterile site raises the question about its potential to occasionally cause disease. For example, a new cyclovirus has recently been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with acute CNS infection, and further work is needed to define its pathogenic role.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "THE HUMAN VIROME"}, {"text": "This area becomes even more complex when we consider co-infections. For example, co-infection with the non-pathogenic human flavivirus GBV-C (Chapter 36: Flaviviruses) has been reported to slow the progression of HIV infection. Progression of SIV infection in non-human primates is accompanied by a major expansion in the animals' enteric virome, which may in itself be involved in disease mechanisms. More extensive testing of children with respiratory illnesses, particularly using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has revealed a significant percentage infected with two or more different viruses concurrently, and the roles of co-infection and interaction between multiple viruses are difficult to clarify. This subject becomes more complex again in immunosuppressed patients. On the other hand, co-infections involving HIV, HCV, and HBV are not unusual, and the implications for disease progression and antiviral treatment have been well studied. Table 39 .1 shows those viruses regularly found in each of the three main compartments in healthy individualsskin, gut, and systemically.

The disease is often preceded by symptoms of rhinitis but can then develop with remarkable speed. Breathing becomes rapid and labored with marked expiratory wheezing, accompanied by a persistent cough, cyanosis, a variable amount of atelectasis, and hyperinflated lung fields visible by X-ray ( fig. 26 .4). The infant may die peracutely, and hence RSV is one of the causes of unexplained \"cot deaths,\" otherwise known as the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Whereas viruses are relatively uncommon causes of pneumonia in immunocompetent adults, accounting for approximately 8% of cases, they are very important in young children. RSV, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus (mainly type 3) are between them responsible for 25% of all pneumonitis in infants in the first year of life. Influenza also causes a considerable number of deaths during epidemic years. Infections with adenoviruses 3 and 7 are less common but can be severe, and long-term sequelae such as obliterative bronchiolitis or bronchiectasis may permanently impair lung function. Up to 20% of pneumonitis in infants has been ascribed to perinatal infection with cytomegalovirus (see Chapter 17: Herpesviruses). CMV may also cause potentially lethal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, as may measles, varicella, and adenoviruses. Moreover, viral pneumonia occasionally develops in adults with varicella and in military recruits during outbreaks of adenovirus 4 or 7 disease. In contrast measles has been often complicated by bacterial pneumonia, especially in malnourished children in Africa and South America. In the elderly, particularly in those with underlying pulmonary or cardiac conditions, influenza is a major cause of death, either via influenza pneumonitis or, more commonly, via secondary bacterial pneumonia attributable to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. Viral pneumonitis often develops insidiously following URTI, and the clinical picture may be atypical. The patient is generally febrile, with a cough and a degree of dyspnea, and auscultation may reveal some wheezing or moist rales. Sputum may be scanty, and laboratory diagnosis of the responsible agent may be confused by the frequent asymptomatic shedding of some viruses, for example, herpesviruses or adenoviruses. Unlike typical bacterial lobar pneumonia with its uniform consolidation, or bronchopneumonia with its streaky consolidation, viral pneumonitis is usually confined to diffuse interstitial lesions.

Miscellaneous \"small round viruses\" and \"parvovirus-like\" agents have been carefully described but a clear etiologic association with disease has yet to be demonstrated. The same applies to the enteric coronaviruses, picobirnaviruses, enteroviruses, the Aichi agent, and enteric toroviruses, which have been isolated or visualized by electron microscopy in feces from patients or even outbreaks of human gastroenteritis (especially in psycho-geriatric patients, AIDS patients, or immunocompromised children), but have not been proven to cause the disease from which they were recovered.

Gastroenteritis vies with upper respiratory infection as the commonest of all infectious diseases and is the greatest cause of death. It has been estimated that 5 to 10 million children die each year in developing countries from diarrheal diseases, rotavirus infections in malnourished infants being a major contributor. Rotaviruses cause severe diarrhea in young children, which may last up to a week and lead to dehydration requiring fluid and electrolyte replacement. Most infections are sporadic, but nosocomial outbreaks occur frequently in hospital nurseries.

Later, suitable techniques were developed for growing these \"fastidious\" or \"enteric\" adenoviruses belonging to species F (types 40 and 41).

Type 2 diabetes is seen more frequently in chronic hepatitis C patients than in controls, which may be related to impaired glucose tolerance following cirrhosis in addition to possible immunological mechanisms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "VIRAL PANCREATITIS AND DIABETES"}, {"text": "For some time there has been significant clinical and research interest in the chronic illness characterized by extreme and persistent fatigue, now with the preferred name, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), but otherwise also known as \"neurasthenia,\" \"myalgic encephalomyelitis,\" or \"post-viral fatigue syndrome.\" The adoption in 1994 and updating in 2015 (see Further Reading) of standard diagnostic criteria and clinical case definition of the syndrome allowed more rigorous casecontrol and epidemiological studies. Infections that have been linked include Coxsackie B viruses, EBV, CMV, influenza, various arboviruses, HHV-6, and HTLV -1 and 2, bacterial infections including brucellosis, Q fever and Lyme disease, and malaria and toxoplasmosis. Typically, an acute \"flu-like\" illness that may or may not have been specifically diagnosed, is followed by unexplained, persistent, or relapsing fatigue that results in a significant reduction of the individual's activity and is accompanied by a variable pattern of other symptoms and signs. Immunologic abnormalities have been recorded in patients, particularly alterations in T cell and NK cell activity. A significant proportion of patients have histories of depression or susceptibility to mental illness prior to the development of the chronic fatigue syndrome.

However, in the many countries where rubella vaccination has made natural rubella infection a rare event, the commonest infective cause of congenital abnormalities is now prenatal infection with cytomegalovirus; approximately 10% to 15% of infected infants will show various features of cytomegalic inclusion disease at birth, while a greater number will later develop hearing loss or intellectual impairment (see Chapter 17: Herpesviruses).

Disseminated neonatal herpes, disseminated varicellazoster, and myocarditis of the newborn due to Coxsackie B virus infection, are all overwhelming generalized infections with high case-fatality rates; these usually follow primary maternal infections late in pregnancy, and because the maternal immune response has not yet developed, the baby is not protected by maternal antibody. Establishing definitive laboratory diagnosis is important, first because antiviral chemotherapy can be lifesaving in infections caused by members of the herpesvirus family, and second because appropriate medical, social, and educational measures (e.g., isolation) should be initiated as early as possible. Newborn babies born to HBsAg-positive, HBeAgpositive mothers almost always themselves become lifelong HBsAg carriers; possible routes of infection were discussed in Chapter 22: Hepadnaviruses and Hepatitis Delta. The probability of perinatal transmission of hepatitis C from a carrier mother to her infant is much lower. However, the risk of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus from an HIV-positive mother to her newborn baby is typically around 20%, but this can be reduced to a low rate by appropriate anti-retroviral drug treatment (Chapter 23: Retroviruses).
