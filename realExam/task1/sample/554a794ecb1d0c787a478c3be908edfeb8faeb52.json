Apart from providing acute care to the overwhelming number of patients with COVID-19 infection, it is crucial to minimize community spread while continuing necessary patient care. 1, 2 To mitigate exposure of patients and to protect health care providers, reduction of any unnecessary face-to-face interaction was recommended. 1 The majority of neurology clinic visits have been either deferred or transformed into tele-health visits. 1, [3] [4] [5] Tele-health in neurology was initially studied in the treatment of Parkinson's disease over 20 years ago and has been widely used in acute stroke care. 4, 6, 7 However, implementation of teleneurology in non-stroke services has been limited. 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine programs were gradually being integrated with medical care throughout the world. 13 It is still a relatively new platform and requires specific infrastructure.",

However, the total number of outpatient encounters was reduced almost by 40-50% in both health systems. At Yale School of Medicine such reduction in volume was secondary to reduction in the number of new patient evaluations. While a detailed breakdown report was not available from Johns Hopkins, a similar reason can be presumed. As tertiary medical centers, both institutions receive a significant number of referrals from a wide territory. Such referrals often demand detailed physical examinations and thorough scrutiny of previous records, and the former was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, resources from the outpatient clinic, including support staff, were relocated to more critical needs, which also may have affected the process of streamlining new appointments. 5",

For some subspecialties, such as epilepsy, where seizure control, assessment of medication adherence and medication side effects, medication adjustments, and counseling, teleneurology are the focus of the follow-up visits, teleneurology can be an excellent substitute of face-to-face encounter. 36, 37 Similarly, diagnostic accuracy, treatment, and outcome of nonacute headache related visits are comparable between teleneurology and face-to-face encounter. 27 For dementia, studies have suggested similar diagnostic accuracy, outcome measure, and compliance between teleneurology and regular outpatient visit. 4, 38 The COVID-19 pandemic will not be the time to optimize the full potential of teleneurology. Basic video conferencing with a reasonable quality or a telephone encounter can be helpful to accommodate the present demand. 20, 23 Particularly when the connection or data speed is not optimal, telephone encounter can provide information on patient wellbeing and also functional status can be estimated. Moreover, for elderly patients, who are not well oriented with new technologies and videoconferencing, and if there is not a second person around to help them, a telephone encounter is the only alternative and can help to avoid a face-to-face visit.
