Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts. Our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to restrict the spread of COVID-19. ",

A Scottish-specific cluster analysis was carried out using the following rules: identical sequences from individuals residing in Scotland were assumed to be linked unless there was a history of travel outside Scotland. Scottish lineages were identified where a basal Scottish sequence was present. Clusters including at least two Scottish sequences were included as evidence of onward transmission if no travel history was present for at least one individual. All rights reserved.

The 452 genomes displayed an average of 3.4 nonsynonymous and 1.8 synonymous nucleotide substitutions in comparison to Wuhan-Hu-1 (Figure 3 ). Analysis of sequencing error indicated that one genome out of seven re-sequenced using target enrichment contained a single insertion error, which would not have impacted clustering in the phylogenetic analysis. The strains introduced into Scotland are diverse with the majority fitting within the B lineage (n= 432) and only 20 from lineage A (22) (Figure 2 ). Two common amino acid replacements encoding 614D/G and 323P/L in spike and nsp12 respectively were observed. D614G has been hypothesised to be associated with increased transmissibility (24) . Similarly another Spike replacement N439K (reported by the CoVsurver receptor binding surveillance GISAID, https://www.gisaid.org/covsurver) occurs with D614G and is circulating in a Scottish cluster of 12 sequences. Introductions were estimated based on both the phylogeny (22) and by travel history and date of sampling. The phylogenetic analysis combined with the epidemiological history permitted the identification of least 113 introductions into Scotland. Notably if identical basal sequences and singleton sequences without a significant travel history were to be counted as separate introductions, the phylogeny was suggestive of as many as 276 introductions into Scotland. Given some of the latter are probably linked infections the true number in our sample will be between these two numbers.",

This shift to community transmission is evident in other example clusters: Figure 4B represents a cluster from a care home, Figure 4C Figure 2) . While the phylogenetic signal is low owing to the low levels of variation in SARS-CoV-2 genome, this analysis demonstrates it is possible to exclude transmission events with high certainty.

On the 28th January, the UK government recommended against all but essential travel to China and for returning travellers to self-isolate for two weeks upon their return regardless of symptoms (27). However, despite evidence of local transmission in Italy as early as February 21st, advice from the Scottish Government for returning travellers from Italy to self-isolate was issued only on the 25 th of February and was limited to those having returned from specific lockdown areas (28-30). By the time this advice was extended to all travellers on 10 th March, the COVID-19 outbreak within Scotland was already being driven by community transmission. A lack of robust measures to manage ingress of infected travellers from emerging pandemic hotspots may have accelerated the course of the outbreak in Scotland and the UK as a whole.",

Further, public health records were not accessed to record linkage with sequence data. While introduction of erroneous variation during sequencing or genome assembly is possible, we estimated experimentally that such rates were extremely low and should not affect clustering patterns in phylogenetic analyses. This analysis, based on the available phylogeny, is most likely to be an under-estimate, despite dense sampling of the beginning of the outbreak.",

Many events may be linked to an identical sequence because SARS-CoV-2 is a slowly evolving RNA virus. Exclusion of linkage may be inferred with more certainty. As the variation present in the global diversity is well-represented in Scotland, reflecting a high number of near simultaneous introductions, tracking of the outbreak is feasible and can be used to refine public health interventions. Our analysis may also have been affected by a shift in sampling all symptomatic individuals to hospitalised patients only during mid-March. Some travel-related introductions may therefore not have been detected (as evidenced by several clusters with no evidence of travel related infection after this time).",
