Materials and methods In order to solve oral healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital has taken effective measures: build a team of experts, which provide a 24-h hotline, online video consultation, and online training and push popular science articles on WeChat. For the treatment of emergency patients aside from routine epidemic prevention measures, some special measures for oral treatment need to be added. Results From January 23, 2020, to March 2, 2020, a total of 3035 patients received oral therapy during the COVID-19 epidemic in our hospital. To our knowledge, no oral health worker or patient has been infected with COVID-19 due to oral treatment, and no patients have complained about the suspension of treatment by complaints hotline. Conclusion COVID-19 is a novel challenge for oral healthcare. Attention should be paid to oral healthcare during the outbreak of COVID-19. Clinical relevance These experiences of oral healthcare can be used as a reference by stomatological hospitals and oral clinics during public health emergencies.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China; it then quickly spread to most provinces of China as well as many other countries, such as Iran, Korea, and Italy, showing an outbreak trend. It quickly attracted worldwide attention [1] and was evaluated as an infectious public health emergency by the World Health Organization. China has therefore launched a first-level response to this major public health emergency. By 24:00 on February 20, 2020, a total of 74,675 confirmed cases and 2121 deaths in China, 1073 confirmed cases and 8 deaths outside China, had been reported by Wu and McGoogan [2] . However, As of March 24, 2020, there are confirmed cases of COVID-19 in more than 100 countries; a total of 81,847 confirmed cases and 3287 deaths in China, a total of 331,533 confirmed cases and 15,386 deaths outside China, including 69,176 in Italy, 53,268 in the USA, and 42,058 in Spain, had been reported.

A total of 1716 medical staff had become infected and 5 have died (0.3%) in China [6] . During oral treatment, doctors' and patients' faces can be in close proximity for a long time. Moreover, equipment such as high-speed turbines and oral cleansers create a lot of water vapor. As such, there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus during this type of work. If a patient conceals his or her illness or visits the dentist during the incubation period, the doctor, the disease can be easily spread during oral diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, in most provinces and cities in China now, all private stomatological hospitals, oral outpatient departments, and oral clinics are required to stop treatment; only public stomatological hospitals and general hospitals retain the necessary emergency stomatological department and operations to deal with acute toothaches, tooth trauma, maxillofacial infection, and other emergencies. Optional treatments have been suspended. While such measures can effectively reduce the occurrence of cross-infection during oral treatment, timely treatment will be delayed for many oral diseases.
