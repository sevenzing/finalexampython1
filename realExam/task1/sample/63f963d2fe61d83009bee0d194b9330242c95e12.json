No society, medical system, or clinician remains unaffected. As outlined in the Pediatric Difficult Intubation Collaborative (PeDI-C) consensus guidelines, 1 the priorities of the collaborative during this pandemic are to provide comprehensive and thoughtful airway management in the hospital setting, to serve on multidisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) teams, to mitigate the risk of asymptomatic transmission from patients and staff to health care workers and vice versa, to determine appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) usage and stewardship, and to protect anesthesiologists and other health care workers to ensure the preservation of a highly skilled pediatric anesthesiology workforce.",

            "text": "During the creation of PeDI-C consensus guidelines, some PeDI-C members recognized an opportunity to leverage the Collaborative's network to study airway management outcomes in pediatric coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. We leveraged the PeDI-C to develop a pediatric COVID-19-specific airway management registry. The goal of the registry is to learn about clinicians' practices and airway management outcomes during the pandemic. Our specific interest is to capture pediatric airway management of COVID (+), COVID (\u2212), persons under investigation (PUI), and healthy patients. The data elements include individual clinical management details, features of staffing and clinical resource management (anesthesiologists and others), PPE utilization/stewardship, and outcomes data. The database aims to capture contemporaneous, specific, reliable, and highly valuable information during the COVID-19 pandemic. By repurposing the existing PeDI-C framework, leadership structure, and unique culture, we plan to contribute to the scientific knowledge of COVID-19 and crisis management approach to a worldwide pandemic. The registry was designed without any PHI or HIPPA elements to allow rapid adoption and dissemination. The registry is housed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and approved by the CHOP IRB as exempt. The PeDI-COVID database is accessible at https://is.gd/PEDICOVID19 and is governed by the PeDI-Collaborative research oversight committee. The PeDI-C welcomes participation by all clinicians performing airway management.",
