Early stage colon and rectal cancers are resected upfront provided hospital resources permit. However, deferral of surgery for up to 6-8 weeks in these patients will not compromise the oncologic or surgical outcomes while preserving hospital resources. For more advanced colon and rectal cancers, we consider greater utilization of neoadjuvant therapy, while simultaneously aiming to be careful stewards of chemotherapy which can immunosuppress the very patients we are trying to protect. Specifically, for patients with localized T3 colon cancers with associated adenopathy, we will use induction chemotherapy if surgery needs to be delayed >8 weeks. Similarly, for rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with high-risk disease (e.g. T4 lesions, N2 disease, extensive extramural vascular invasion).

With the increased risk of infection among frontline providers, preoperative COVID-19 testing is critical to reassuring healthcare providers who are worried about infecting themselves and their families. Importantly, the prospect of contracting the virus in the weeks and months ahead, even on the downslope of the curve or in the setting of a second wave this summer, remains a significant health concern for providers. As of April 7, we required COVID-19 testing of patients the day before surgery and of out-of-state patients coming to clinic after a 14-day home quarantine. However, at the time of writing, universal testing is not yet available for all patients, visitors, hospital staff, or non-surgical procedural services (e.g.",

Another key requirement for return to \"normalcy\" is the availability of PPE for providers. We currently allow usage of our limited supply of N95 masks when oropharyngeal, nasal, or tracheal mucosa is exposed for prolonged periods, and for endotracheal tube placement and removal. However, a more robust supply would not only enhance safety but also bring peace of mind to providers performing \"elective\" procedures that do not currently qualify for N95 mask use, and ultimately facilitate an easing back into pre-COVID-19 clinical practice.",

Those cases without clear consensus agreement are recommended for review at our departmental conference and include: ER-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-positive disease with complete or near-complete response to neoadjuvant therapy; advanced ER-positive breast cancers treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and premenopausal women with ER-positive disease.",
