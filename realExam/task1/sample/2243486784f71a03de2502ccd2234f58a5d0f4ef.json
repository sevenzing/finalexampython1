However, in some patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID19, it may be challenging when deciding whether to proceed with intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. In COVID19, more than ever, pre-warned is pre-armed. Intubation is a high-risk procedure: around 10% of patients in this setting develop severe hypoxaemia (SpO 2 < 80%) and approximately 2% experience cardiac arrest. 21 The Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management released a fast-track publication with the recommendation to proceed with endotracheal intubation for patients showing no improvement in respiratory distress, tachypnoea (respiratory rate greater than 30 per min), and poor oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO 2 ] to fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO 2 ] ratio less than 150 mm Hg) after 2 h high-flow oxygen therapy or NIV. 22 These criteria should be regarded as empirical as there is no robust supporting evidence. Intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should not be adversely delayed! Aerosol-generating procedures carried the highest risks of SARS transmission to HCWs (Table 1) . 1, 2 Intubation, and the steps leading up to it, are some of the highest-risk moments for COVID19 spread to HCWs and other patients. 22,23 Droplet precautions will not be enough to protect against COVID19 spread during intubation. Droplet spread is caused by viral particles within small drops of bodily fluids. 9 Considering their larger size and mass, they fall with gravity within a couple of meters. 24 In one retrospective SARS study, not only the intubating doctor, but also the nurses assisting the intubating doctor were at higher risk of infection. 25 As such, limiting the components of intubation that can send aerosolised virus into the room should be a priority. The intubation attempt should be as quick as possible with a fully paralysed patient with the minimum safe number of people in the room. 13 Intubate with a 7.0-8.0 mm inner diameter (women) or 8.0-9.0 mm inner diameter tracheal tube.

Vasoplegia accounts for severe hypoxaemia. The near normal compliance explains why some patients present without dyspnoea as the patient inhales the volume he expects. The increase in minute volume (mainly in response to hypoxaemia) leads to a decrease in PaCO 2 . A combination of increased lung permeability (inflammation) and negative inspiratory pressure (increased minute volume by increasing tidal volume) results in interstitial lung oedema. This phenomenon has been recently recognised as the leading cause of patient-self inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). 51 With increasing oedema, the gas volume in the lungs decreases, the tidal volumes generated for a given inspiratory pressure decreases, and dyspnoea develops. The transition from type L to H may be due to both the evolution of COVID19 and injury attributable to highstress ventilation. Type L patients may respond to just an increase in FiO 2 (to reverse hypoxaemia) if not yet breathless, or HFNO/NIV if dyspnoea. High PEEP, in some patients, may decrease the pleural pressure swings and stop the vicious cycle that exacerbates lung injury. However, high PEEP in patients with normal compliance may have detrimental effects on haemodynamics. In any case, noninvasive options are questionable, as they may be associated with high failure rates and delayed intubation, in a disease which typically lasts several weeks. Once intubated and deeply sedated, the type L patients, if hypercapnic, can be ventilated with volumes greater than 6 ml/kg (up to 8-9 ml/kg). as the high compliance results in tolerable strain without the risk of VILI. Prone positioning should be used only as a rescue manoeuvre, as the lung conditions are 'too good' for the prone position effectiveness, which is based on improved stress and strain redistribution. The PEEP should be reduced to 8-10 cm H 2 O, given that the recruit ability is low and the risk of haemodynamic failure increases at higher levels.
