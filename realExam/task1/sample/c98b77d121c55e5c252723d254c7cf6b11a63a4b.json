In older children, adolescents, and adults, aerosols should be inhaled by means of the VHC mouthpiece and well-defined respiratory maneuvers designed to maximize deposition of medical aerosol particle (MMAD Q 2 1-5 mm) in the lower respiratory tract. 3 In contrast to many other countries that have replaced SVN bronchodilator therapy with pMDIs with VHCs, the United States has continued to use SVN in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

            "text": "The main impetus for continuing to use SVNs was perceived financial considerations. Because the MDI unit used to cost about $200 and had to be single-patient use (not reimbursed), it was ''clearly more cost-effective'' to use the SVN. However, this is true only if one considers the devices and not the true cost of the longer emergency department and often intensive care unit stay. Recent studies showed a significant cost saving with MDIs/VHCs because patients improved faster, were sent home more quickly, and could be taught in the emergency department to use the MDIs/ VHCs, thus decreasing early readmission. 4, 5 VHCs have numerous additional advantages including an up to 80% decrease in the upper respiratory tract deposition of inhaled medication, and generation of significantly smaller particles that better penetrate into the lung periphery. 3 Furthermore, they are totally self-contained and do not require an external, expensive, and bulky source of energy.",

Given the current pandemic of COVID-19, Canadians have further restricted the delivery of aerosol by nebulizers, with Global Initiative for Asthma 10 and many other international authorities following suit. On April 8, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic albuterol inhaler in the United States. This is a major step that promises to make pMDIs/VHCs increasingly favored over SVNs for treating reversible airflow obstruction. It is our view that caregivers worldwide should also adopt the conversion from SVNs to pMDIs/VHCs for bronchodilator therapy. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60 ",
