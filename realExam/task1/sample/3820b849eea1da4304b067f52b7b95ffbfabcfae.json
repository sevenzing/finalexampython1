Choropleth maps describing geographical 1 8 1 distributions of COVID-19 case rates for the country and 12 Indian states through 4 1 8 2 intervention periods were generated by R software. The R t for 12 Indian states and for the entire country were calculated as per the 1 8 4 method developed by Cori et al. 13 . This method estimates R t from the incidence time-series 1 8 5 and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval. We used the daily 1 8 6 number of reported COVID-19 cases from the above-mentioned official data sources. The 5-d moving average was used to estimate R t and its 95% credible interval on each day.
