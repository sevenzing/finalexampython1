Among the different synthetic strategies available, either novel or already known but efficient and versatile methodologies are covered. The simple modifications of one or more substituents linked to the nitrogen N-1, the C-3, and the C-4 carbon atoms of the b-lactam nucleus were considered as an alternative synthetic protocol of more complex and polyfunctionalized molecules. Indeed, it is well known and extensively reviewed that the biological activity of this strained four-membered heterocycle is strictly dependent on the nature of the substituent groups that affect the reactivity towards the molecular active sites, increasing or lowering the possibility of interaction with the substrates. Finally, a synthetic survey of the most significant biological and pharmacological applications of the 2-azetidinones is reported.",

After the discovery of penicillins and cephalosporins as classical b-lactam antibiotics and clinically useful active agents, the past few decades have witnessed a remarkable growth in the field of b-lactam chemistry [1, 2] . The need for potentially effective b-lactam antibiotics as well as more effective b-lactamase inhibitors has motivated synthetic organic and medicinal chemists to design new functionalized 2-azetidinones. Besides their clinical use as antibacterial agents, these compounds have also been used as synthons in the preparation of various heterocyclic compounds of biological significance [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The potential use of some b-lactams as therapeutic agents for lowering plasma cholesterol levels has been documented as well [8, 9] . Extensive studies of the human leukocyte elastase (HLE) inhibitory mechanism and the biological activity of this class of compounds have also been published [10] .",

Among these classes of antibacterials, b-lactam antibiotics are still the most commonly used, over 50 years after their initial introduction. The most common mechanism for resistance to b-lactam antibiotics is the ability of bacteria to produce b-lactamases [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . These enzymes hydrolyze the b-lactam moiety in the drugs, inactivating the antibiotics. Studies of amino acid sequence homology have identified four distinct classes of b-lactamase: A, B, C, and D [22] . Among these, classes A and C are currently the most important in human disease [21] . A successful approach to overcoming the adverse action of these enzymes has been the coadministration of b-lactamase inhibitors together with the typical b-lactam antibiotics, such as pennicillins [21] [22] [23] [24] . Unfortunately, this approach has been compromised by the discovery of new variants of b-lactamases, resistant to the inhibition afforded by known inhibitors [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Therefore, the development of novel b-lactam inhibitors to withstand inactivation by the ever-increasing diversity of b-lactamases has thus been a continuous and still on-going battle.",

LE also activates the proenzymatic form of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 [31] , massively released by the PMN leukocytes and instrumental to their extravasation [33, 34] . A number of b-lactams, compounds widely used as antimicrobial drugs, have been identified as inhibitors of these serine enzymes, in particular LE [35] . Inhibitors of LE, and in particular of HLE, have a core structure of a four-membered b-lactam ring.

Although vasopressin is perhaps best-known for its role in the cardiovascular system, it also has actions in the central nervous system (CNS).

The cyclization of imines with acetylglyoxylic acid, in the presence of POCl 3 and Et 3 N, gave 3-acetoxy-b-lactams in good yields as cisisomers, prevalently. These latter were hydrolyzed to alcohols in excellent yields under very mild conditions. Subsequent oxidations were performed by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of phosphorous pentoxide to give a-keto-b-lactams. More 2-azetidinones were synthesized varying the substituent of the acetyl moiety. 4-acylamino and 4-sulphonamido-trans-b-lactams have been reported to be synthesized from trisubstituted amidines via cycloaddition reaction with ketenes (Scheme 12), [60] . Amidines bearing an electron-withdrawing substituent on enamine nitrogen could increase the b-lactam stability. The starting trisubstituted amidines were prepared by reacting N 0 ,N 0 -diarylamidines with aryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine. D-xylose derivative has been reported to be an excellent chiral auxiliary in the Staudinger reaction for the construction of b-lactams (Scheme 13), [61] .",

Finally, [125] . Although many attempts have been made to explain the Staudinger reaction, the nature of the relative stereoselectivity remains obscure. Several investigators have suggested different models to predict the stereoselectivity, but their proposals were in conflict to some extent [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] . An interesting contribution to the interpretation of the stereoselectivity in the b-lactam formation was done by Xu and coworkers [118] . They proposed a model based on a kinetic analysis of the cis/trans ratios of reaction product. Based on their results the origin of the relative stereoselectivity can be described as follows: a) the stereoselectivity is generated as a result of the competition between the direct ring closure and the isomerization of the imine moiety in the zwitterionic intermediate; b) the ring closure step is most likely an intramolecular nucleophilic addition of the enolate to the imine moiety, that is obviously affected by the electronic effect of the ketene and the imine substituents; c) electron-donating ketene substituents and electron-withdrawing imine substituents accelerate the direct ring closure, leading to a preference for cis-b-lactam formation, while electron-withdrawing ketene substituents and electron-donating imine substituents (EDG) slow the direct ring closure, leading to a preference for trans-b-lactam formation; d) the electronic effects of the substituents on the isomerization is a minor factor influencing the stereoselectivity (Scheme 48 and Fig. 2 ).",

The enhanced conformational flexibility of the carboxylate of the homologated penam derivative could enable the molecule to fulfill the geometric requirements of both A and C classes of serine b-lactamase.

The additional carbon could allow greater conformational flexibility, thus allowing the carboxylate of structure I to occupy a space similar to that occupied in a typical cephalosporin substrate. It may be noted, however, that the compounds having the exocyclic unsaturation (II and III, Fig. 29 ) did not display a significant ability to inactivate either class A or class C serine b-lactamases. This could be due to the conformational rigidity imposed by the exocyclic unsaturation. These compounds were slowly hydrolyzed in buffered aqueous media and this hydrolysis was accelerated in the presence of the class A serine b-lactamase, thus indicating that they were good substrates. As in the penems and carbapenems, the unsaturation present on the five-membered ring (endocyclic or exocyclic) presumably further activated the b-lactam moiety towards hydrolysis. This could explain the reduced hydrolytic stability of structures II and III (Fig. 29) .",

Further, the 2-azetidinone nucleus has been employed in 2004 by Ruddle and Smyth to prepare b-lactamase-dependent prodrugs which have hidden or latent reactivity that is triggered by scission of the b-lactam ring [319] . Thus, the penam nucleus could be modified to behave as a b-lactamase-dependent \"prodrug\" by incorporation of a vinyl ester side chain at the C-6 position. b-Lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the b-lactam ring uncovered the thiazolidine-ring nitrogen as a nucleophile that drove a rapid intramolecular displacement on the side chain (Scheme 116). Attachment of 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin as the releasable group of this side chain generated a penicillin structure that can function as a fluorescence-based reporter substance/diagnostic for the presence of low levels of b-lactamase enzyme in solution (Scheme 117), [320] .",

Many pathogenic bacteria assemble pili, i.e., extracellular protein organelles, to mediate attachment to host epithelial cells. Pilus assembly is performed by periplasmic chaperones, which bring subunits to the outer cell membrane where they are incorporated in the growing pilus [323] . A drug inhibiting pilus formation, termed a pilicide, would therefore have the potential of being an effective antibiotic. It has been shown, both by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [324] and by X-ray Scheme 116 Suggested mechanism of action ofa b-lactamase-dependent prodrug crystallography [325, 326] , that synthetic peptides from the conserved C-termini of the pilus proteins are bound by the PapD chaperone (found in uropathogenic Escherichia Coli, which is the main cause of urinary tract infections). Thus, it has been found that PapD binds polypeptides by anchoring the peptide carboxyl terminus to the side chains of Arg 8 and Lys 112 (Fig. 30) , two residues that are invariant in all periplasmic chaperones and are required for pilus assembly. On the basis of the crystal structures of peptide-PapD complexes [325, 326] , b-lactams have been selected as potential chaperone inhibitors with the requirement of having different stereochemistry than the original penicillin's, thus having a chance to withstand enzymatic degradation by penicillin-resistant bacteria. The overall strategy consisted in creating small organic molecules with a rigid framework, which would locate the pharmacophores in the right position in the space [57] . In addition, this class of compounds allowed hydrophobic substituents (indicated by R) to interact with the chaperone while maintaining the important anchoring to Arg 8 and Lys 112 . Moreover, the crystal structures showed that the C-terminal carboxyl group was within such a distance from Lys 112 that replacing it with an aldehyde would allow an imine to be formed with Lys 112 .",

Rather than interfering directly with cell wall biosynthesis, through irreversible acylation of penicillin binding transpeptidases, these compounds seemed to affect cellular processes through transfer of the N-organothio group to a bacterial thiol. It has been also noted that these lactams exert antiproliferative properties against only a narrow range of bacterial genera, most significantly, Staphylococcus (including MRSA), Micrococcus, and Neisseria. This selectivity seems to be related to the levels and types of cellular thiols present in each microbe that is sensitive to the lactams, not to whether the microbes are Gram positive or Gram negative classes.

            "text": "The b-lactams have been individually tested for antibacterial activity against Bacillus anthracis and six other species of Bacillus by the well known Kirby-Bauer method on agar plates [329] . In general, lipophilic acyloxy or alkoxy groups at the C-3 carbon of the lactam ring led to the strongest growth inhibition properties against each of the seven Bacillus microbes examined. The most important substituent influencing the anti-Bacillus activity, as in the case of MRSA, was found to be the N-organothio moiety, with the sec-butylthio group having the best overall bioactivity. The mechanism of action of these lactams in Bacillus most likely paralleled that in Staphylococcus, with transfer of the N-organothio substituent from the lactam to a cellular thiol occurring within the cytoplasm of the bacterium [328] . Recent findings in 2007 indicated that N-thiolated-b-lactams react rapidly within the bacterial cell with CoA through in vivo transfer of the N-thio group to produce an alkyl-CoA mixed disulfide species, which then interferes with fatty acid biosynthesis. The studies on CoA disulfide reductase showed that the CoA thiolredox buffer was not perturbed by these compounds; however, the lactams appeared to act as prodrugs. The evidence that these b-lactams inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis in bacteria, and the elucidation of CoA as a primary cellular target, offers opportunities for the discovery of other small organic compounds that can be developed as therapeutics for MRSA and anthrax infections [330] . The same authors have found in 2008 that these lactams also possess antifungal activity against Candida and other fungi by exerting powerful cytostatic effects that disrupt the structural integrity of cytoplasmic membranes. The mode of action and structure-activity trends of these lactams as antifungals parallel that previously seen in their antibacterial studies [331] . Jarrahpour and coworkers in 2004 have prepared and tested some new sugarbased monocyclic b-lactams possessing several other functionalities, in addition to the carbohydrate moiety [88] . The presence of a carbohydrate moiety side chain in a drug may also overcome the frequently observed water insolubility problem [332] . Moreover, the bacteria may utilize a carbohydrate uptake mechanism, which allows for a better transport of the monocyclic b-lactams across the membrane. The antibacterial activities of compounds depicted in Fig. 32 have been tested against one strain each of a Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus citrus), a Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), a Gram negative containing capsule (Klebsiella), and a Gram positive spore (Bacillus subtilis). The antimicrobial activity tests have been performed according to the disk diffusion method [333] , using Ampicillin and Gentamycin as reference compounds. The inhibition zones caused by the various compounds on the microorganisms have been measured and the activity rated on the basis of the size of the inhibition zone.",

Preliminary results of the antibacterial activity of some of these 4-alkyliden-b-lactams have disclosed the opportunity for the application of molecular modeling to relate chemical structures to antibiotic activity and to point out structural modifications that might increase antibiotic potency. Despite significant advances in the elucidation of the structures of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the overall structural basis for multidrug bacterial resistance has not been clarified. PBPs are a heterogeneous family of enzymes with transpeptidase and transcarboxylase activities involved in the synthesis and crosslinking of the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which is fundamental for the maintenance of bacterial cell morphology and integrity. On the basis of these considerations, the authors adopted a molecular modeling approach to identify attractive drug candidates and to contribute to the rationalization of functional group effects on the SARs. Thus, a series of b-lactams have been synthesized such as compounds of Fig. 34 , that exhibited an inhibitory effect, generally more marked against Gram positive pathogens, although the spectrum of activity varied.",

Time-dependent inhibitors of enzyme HLE, based on the cephem nucleus, have been reported. A series of cephalosporin tert-butyl esters have been examined, and the activity of these compounds has been found to be very sensitive to the C-7 substituents, the greatest activity being showed by small, a-oriented, and electron-withdrawing groups. Additionally, the oxidation state of the sulphur atom has been found to play a strategic role in strengthening molecular activity. For instance, sulfones showed considerably greater activity than the corresponding sulfides or b-sulfoxides, resulting the latter inactives [339] . The mechanisms thought to be at work when molecules of this type inhibit HLE have been studied (Scheme 118), [339] . Two types of inhibited complexes can be formed, at least, with HLE. The starting step, in all cases, is considered to be the b-lactam ring-opening performed by the OH of the Ser-195 belonging to the enzyme catalytic triad (Ser-195, His-57, Asp-102), to form the complex I. If the C-7 substituent is a chlorine atom, the expulsion of the 3 0 -acetate, followed by loss of HCl and Michael addition of His-57 imidazole ring to the N-1 nitrogen, led to the inhibited complex II. However, when the C-7 substituent is a poorer leaving group, such as methoxide (III, Scheme 118), crystallographic data suggested that this group is not lost but the thiazoline ringopening reaction generated an inhibited species. At this point, it is not possible to discern if there is a second covalent linkage between the inhibitor and the enzyme (IV, Scheme 118) or, alternatively, if a critical salt bridge between the released sulfinate and the His-57 imidazole is formed. In this latter case, the hydrolysis of the intermediate V is presumably slowed as the imidazole moiety is not properly aligned to deliver water to the serine carbonyl ester.",

These b-lactams behaved as reversible inhibitors of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) [347] [348] [349] [350] , which are considered good models of HLE and more readily available than HLE. The action mechanism of these 2-azetidinone derivatives was different, depending on the C-3/C-4 substitution. Indeed, after a transient inhibition of PPE, enzyme hydrolysis of structure I (Scheme 119) led to the b-lactam bond cleavage without expulsion of OR leaving group, while PPE processing of structure II led to the OR 1 ester cleavage, without the b-lactam ring opening.",

A series of 4-alkylaminocarbonyl-1-alkoxycarbonyl-2-azetidinones and 4-(alkoxycarbonyl)-2-azetidinones, bearing various carbonyl and thiocarbonyl functionalities at the N-1 position, have been prepared [351] . The results showed the potential interest towards N-thiocarbonyl-2-azetidinones as reactive structures for the design of novel elastase inhibitors. However, an electron-withdrawing substituent (activating group) placed at the C-4 position (or the C-3) was systematically required to reach a good level of enzyme inhibition. For instance, compound I of Fig. 36 was a good reversible inhibitor of PPE and HLE, acting most probably like 3-halide-1-alkoxycarbonyl-2-azetidinones (I, Scheme 119). Compound II (Fig. 36 ) was more active against PPE and HLE, but behaved in the same way as 1,4-bis(alkoxycarbonyl)-2-azetidinones (II, Scheme 119) [351] .",

Since the thrombin inhibitor I has been described so far only in the racemic form, and no stereochemistry/activity relationship has been reported, the possibility of obtaining both enantiomers of compound III was worth investigating. b-Lactam compounds variously substituted at C-3, C-4, and N-1 were reported, more recently, as useful inhibitors of tryptase, and thrombin [371, 372] .",

Using a novel monocyclic beta lactam platform, a series of orally active vasopressin V1a antagonists was developed, by the group of Guillon, showing high affinity for the human receptor. SRX251 was chosen from this series of V1a antagonists to screen for effects on serenic activity in a residentintruder model of offensive aggression.

The cis geometry of the rigid fourmembered ring forces the three side-chains together into a fixed geometric configuration, enabling, presumably, the complementarity with subpockets of the receptor. Although the molecular weight of compound I is relatively high, its compactness provided some hope that the series might show significant oral absorption [381] .

On the basis of these findings, an investigation on SAR around the 2-azetidinone nucleus has been performed. The results have revealed a clear SAR for cholesterol absorption inhibition which is different from the modest ACAT inhibitory activity shown by these compounds. Thus, these molecules appeared to be acting via a mechanism which might be fundamentally important in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol [8] . Moreover, structurally related 2-azetidinones (II and III Fig. 42 ) containing hydroxyl groups on the phenylalkyl substituent at the C-3, have been reported as CAIs more active than their deshydroxy analogs [9, 385] . b-Lactams having a substituent containing a ketonic moiety at the C-3 have also been reported as good inhibitors for cholesterol absorption [386] . A summary of the basic SARs in the 2-azetidinone compounds is shown in Scheme 120. The presence of a 4-methoxyphenyl or similar hydrogen bonding moiety and a proper absolute stereochemistry at the C-4 carbon atom, are both critical in producing the activity. The phenylalkyl group at the C-3 and the monosubstitution at the C-3 and the C-4 positions seem to be less critical. A N-aryl group seems to be required, but there is considerable tolerance for the substitution at the phenyl ring. The azetidinone ring is required, but there is no evidence that it acts as anything more than a scaffold to correctly position the pharmacophore groups [384] .",

Data presented previously have suggested that there was a molecular target for these compounds, which has been designated as the CAI binding protein (CAIBP). The initial approach of Burnett and coworkers has been to use radiolabeled binding compounds for the identification of subcellular localization sites in intestinal cells [140, 389] . Having some knowledge of where the compounds were binding, they hoped to identify any specific proteins that had high affinity for this class of CAIs using other techniques. Based on their extensive SAR developments of the azetidinone CAI series, in 2002 the same authors have found that the two best structural sites for elaboration, while maintaining in vivo activity, were the N-aryl ring and the pendant aryl ring. For sensitivity reasons, their initial binding studies required radioiodinated analogs and thus, targets II and III (Fig. 43) came to the fore [140] .",

The derivatives bearing a benzylic hydroxyl moiety displayed a significant potency advantage over compounds II and III while the N-iodophenyl analog V was slightly more potent than the pendent iodophenyl derivative IV. Since it has been discovered that compound I (SCH 58235) in vivo exists predominantly as its glucuronide [388] , in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanism of action, neither the free phenol nor the glucuronide could be precluded as the bioactive species. Therefore, the corresponding iodinated glucuronide of derivative V was required. This compound, depicted as VI in Fig. 43 , has shown significant reduction of hepatic cholesterol esters. Thus, the same group of researchers has designed and prepared a number of potent CAIs with fluorescent absorption and emission properties making them suitable for use as biological tools in the investigation of the mechanism of action of this important class of new pharmacological agents [139] .",

The antihyperglycemic effect of test compounds was evaluated by monitoring their effect on blood glucose and liver glycogen contents [390] . In the diabetic rats, high glucose levels and depression in hepatic glycogen contents could be attributed to less availability of the active form of enzyme glycogen synthetase, which in turn has been reported to be responsible for incorporation of glucose moieties in pre-existing glycogen chain [391, 392] . Test compounds significantly lowered the serum glucose levels indicating their antihyperglycemic activity. This activity may be due to increased utilization of glucose, as indicated by decreased serum glucose levels, and increase in the activity of glycogen synthetase enzyme, as evidenced by augmented liver glycogen contents in test groups. Concerning the antidiabetic activity of test compounds the following structure activity relationships were observed:",

In 2007 a series of b-lactam derivatives was designed and synthesized to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the human 20S proteasome.

Both tri-and tetra-substituted ureas were effective, with tetra substitution giving a slight stability advantage. Modification of the benzyl function indicated that strong electron-withdrawing groups at the para position had the best activity. Moreover, mechanistic investigations indicated that these compounds are reversible and competitive inhibitors of HCMV protease and that inhibition involved the formation of an acyl-enzyme species [367] .

No appreciable influence of the absolute configuration, either at the C-4 or at the 1-phenylethyl substituent, on the inhibition of viral replication, was observed. The presence of an aromatic group at the 1-acyl Novel and Recent Synthesis and Applications of b-Lactams substituent seemed to be important for the antiviral activity, as deduced from the lack of activity of the tert-butoxycarbonyl derivative g and the presence of activity of the benzyloxycarbonyl analog f, (Fig. 50 ). This latter compound showed the highest anti-HCMV activity within the b-lactam series, but with a very narrow therapeutic window, having a cell toxicity value close to the IC50 data for viral inhibition [263] . Interestingly, removal of the carbonyl group from the b-lactam ring, most likely acting as the serine trap, resulted in an azetidine derivative with anti-HCMV activity comparable to that of the reference compound ganciclovir [281, 419] .",

The contributions examined are those published from 2000 till date; the literature survey was organized by type of reaction, and, among them, by year. The synthetic strategies reported are based either on novel methodologies or on already known but efficient and versatile protocols. An alternative methodology, reported in a separate paragraph, was the modification of preexisting groups linked at the different positions of the 2-azetidinone ring. Considering that the core structure of four-membered cyclic amide is the common feature of the antibacterial compounds, and that their biological and pharmacological activity are strictly related to the substituents linked to this small heterocycle, the modification of these linked groups not only afford new b-lactam derivatives, more complex and polyfunctionalized, but can produce molecules even more efficient in their activity. For this reason, a single paragraph of this chapter was focused on the studies reported in literature concerning the SARs of the b-lactams examined, with the aim of highlighting the possibility of designing new and even more efficient b-lactam compounds. We believe that this chapter can become an essential part of the knowledge of organic chemists who can plan the synthesis of novel substituted 2-azetidinones. Moreover, medicinal chemists can have an overview, covering the latest developments in the biological and pharmacological applications of these 2-azetidinone compounds, thereby giving focus to their future investigations.",
