Fever, myalgia, arthralgia, leucocytosis are the typical findings of SS. Oral mucosa involvement is an uncommon finding in Sweet's syndrome (2-12%) [3, 4] . Oral ulcers are the most frequent mucosa involvement as in our patient. An immune reaction against the drugs, tumors or microbiological agents may start a cytokine cascade resulting in the onset of SS [5] . In our case, no other cause except SARS-CoV-2 could be identified. The overlapping symptoms of SS with COVID-19 complicated the diagnosis in this case.

The periodic acid-Schiff stain was negative. In the light of both clinical and histopathological features, the findings were interpreted as erythema nodosum like Sweet's syndrome (SS). The repeated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. Due to prolonged fever despite the empirical treatment, a positron emission tomography scan was performed. It showed diffuse, bilateral parenchymal lung infiltration >%30. Tocilizumab 400mg intravenous infusion was given once, and Favipiravir was started for five days. Fever subsided in 24 hours.
