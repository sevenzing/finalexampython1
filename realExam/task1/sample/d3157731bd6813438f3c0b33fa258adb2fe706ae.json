The increased demand on ambulatory clinical capacity created several health system challenges. First, it was difficult to provide care to the patients who needed it most when front-line clinicians and staff were spending a large proportion of their time on triage. Second, the surge of patients walking into urgent care and primary care practices for advice created an infection control hazard.

Symptom and comorbidity questions were adapted from nursing telephone triage protocols, [13] clinical practice guidelines [12, 14, 15] and early reports of clinical symptomatology of COVID-19.

Question phrasing was continuously revised based on feedback from front-line triage and advice nurses and physicians to clarify any elements that caused patient confusion. The self-triage and self-scheduling tool protocol ( Figure 1 ) includes four endpoints for symptomatic patients: self-care, non-urgent evaluation, urgent evaluation, and emergent evaluation. Patients with one of four life-threatening symptoms (chest pain, severe shortness of breath, facial cyanosis, or confusion) are instructed to call 911 or present to the emergency department (ED), and are also given the phone number to the UCSF COVID-19 Hotline if they prefer to be re-triaged by a nurse. If patients are classified as \"urgent\" evaluation, they are directed to call the UCSF COVID-19 Hotline to make an appointment within 12 hours at the newly established UCSF Respiratory Screening Clinic. Patients classified as \"non-urgent\" are triaged to a visit in the UCSF Video Acute Care Clinic, ideally within 12 hours, but up to within 24 hours.

In the first two weeks of deployment, the tool was completed over 1000 times, and nearly one in 60 eligible patients completed it at least once.

The tool was designed to \"do no harm\": to have high sensitivity to detect emergency-level illness, and high specificity when recommending selfcare, both of which were greater than 85%. Despite designing the tool with this conservative approach, the most frequent triage disposition was self-care. The majority of these patients did not make further contact with our health system during the subsequent two days. This tool may have therefore prevented hundreds of unnecessary encounters. Eliminating unnecessary in-person visits has the potential to prevent patient exposure to pathogens en route to clinic visits and in waiting rooms, reduce personal protective equipment use by clinic staff, and liberate front-line clinicians to focus on caring for sicker patients.

However, the percentage of emergent cases decreased over time as we made changes to the wording of emergent symptom questions, suggesting the potential to improve performance with front-line clinician and patient feedback. The self-triage and self-scheduling tool we implemented has several limitations. First, this intervention reached a limited patient demographic. It was only available to adult patients with portal access who have primary care physicians at UCSF, and was only available in English. Privately insured patients were overrepresented among the population using the symptom checker compared to the primary care population as a whole, which is consistent with literature on the digital divide.

Finally, we were limited in our ability to compare the effects of this intervention to a control group given the primary objective of quickly addressing a pressing health system concern, and the unprecedented ambulatory surge precluding the use of an historic control. This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was presented to our EHR vendor and is now part of their base content, meaning that it is available for use by their other customers.
