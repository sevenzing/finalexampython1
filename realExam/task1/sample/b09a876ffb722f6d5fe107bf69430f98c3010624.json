It points to issues in documenting the deaths of older adults, the lack of preparation for such a crisis in long-term care homes, how some 'protective' policies can be considered patronising and how the initial perception of the public was that the virus was really an older adult",

The pandemic was initially not taken seriously, in France, and elsewhere, where the public discourse presented it as only dangerous to older adults. It may have been the case that this narrative partially explained the resistance to following public health guidelines. Even after many weeks of COVID-19, governments are still begging citizens to stay home. In other words, is this pandemic reinforcing and highlighting the dormant 'us' versus 'them' phenomenon? It is also revealing that the younger adults who have died from complications of COVID-19 throughout the world have often generated long and in-depth media reports, while the deaths of thousands of older adults have been simply counted and summarised, if they were documented at all. This implies that the death of a young adult merits a life story, while the death of an older adult is too often merely a statistic.",

In one Canadian city, people over 70 years of age have been encouraged to sign up for the 'vulnerable person registry' [9] .

When medical equipment, and hospital capacity becomes scarce, care providers may be faced with the ethical decisions about whose life takes priority and age may become a deciding factor.
