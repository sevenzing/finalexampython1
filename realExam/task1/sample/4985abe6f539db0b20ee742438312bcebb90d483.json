This fast progression led the world health organization (WHO) to classify it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Waiting for the availability of new vaccines, this global emergency has triggered the search for safe and effective pharmacological approaches for eradicating the virus, or at least reducing its effects and hindering the contagion. Currently, great effort focuses on the repurposing of already available drugs based on the characteristics of the virus that have been so far defined. Thus, clinical studies are currently ongoing to evaluate the effects on SARS-CoV-2 of known drugs showing broad-spectrum antiviral activity. This list includes favipiravir (plus interferon-\u03b1 ChiCTR2000029600; IL6) is under clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765) due to positive effects observed in coronavirus patients who showed serious lung damage and elevated levels of IL6. 3 Due to the genomic similarity (82%) with the previous SARS-Cov virus (responsible for a major pandemic at the beginning of this century), other drug targets are also receiving attention. 4 Indeed, some viral components may be potential candidates for targeted therapies against SARS-Cov-2. Among these, two viral proteases necessary for viral replication, the papain-like cysteine protease (PL pro ) and the chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease 3CL pro , and the non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) (accessory protein for virus replication) have been proposed as potential targets. 5 Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade the host cell by interaction between the viral glycosylated spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2).Then, the binding between the virus and the host ACE2 is a key factor for initiating the viral infection. Moreover, this binding has been proposed to cause ACE2 downregulation; the consequent ACE2 deficiency and dysregulation seems to play a pathogenetic role in the progression of the overwhelming lung inflammation, observed in the most serious cases of CoVid-19.6 ACE2 is located on the surface membrane of host cells in particular on lungs, heart, and vascular endothelium and is specifically recognized and bound by the viral spike protein.7 Therefore, interfering with the interaction between these two proteins may represent a use-ful pharmacological strategy. This strategy has been already used to fight the previous SARS-CoV infection in 2003 and lead to the development of the ACE2 protein decoy APN01 (Recombinant Human ACE2; NCT00886353). APN01 is currently under evaluation in a Phase III clinical trial by Apeiron Biologics for treating CoVid-19.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "ent conformational changes of the protein.
