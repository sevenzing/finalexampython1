Histopathologically, the skin lesions were characterized by perivascular infiltrates of macrophages, neutrophils, with fewer plasma cells, mast cells, and small lymphocytes in the mid-to deep dermis. Immunohistochemistry for intracellular feline coronavirus (FeCoV) antigen demonstrated positive staining in dermal macrophages providing an antemortem diagnosis of a moderate, nodular to diffuse, pyogranulomatous perivascular dermatitis due to FIP infection. Obtaining an antemortem diagnosis of FIP can be a challenge and cutaneous lesions are rare in the disease. Recognition and biopsy of any cutaneous lesions in cats with panuveitis and suspected FIP can help establish an antemortem diagnosis of the disease.",

Three days prior to presentation, the owner noted multiple nonpruritic, raised skin lesions. Ocular examination revealed a normal neuroophthalmic examination. Schirmer's tear tests (Schirmer Tear Test Strips; Alcon Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) were 13 and 24 mm/min in the right (OD) and left eyes (OS), respectively. The intraocular pressures were estimated with a rebound tonometer (TonoVet; Tiolat, Helsinki, Finland) and were 9 mmHg bilaterally. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy (Osram 64222; Carl Zeiss Canada, Don Mills, ON, Canada) revealed bilateral chemosis and a prolapsed left third eyelid. Aqueous flare was present bilaterally, and fibrin with blood was evident in the right anterior chamber (Fig. 1 ). Indirect ophthalmoscopic examination (Heine Omega 200; Heine Instruments Canada, Kitchener, ON, Canada) following dilation with 0.5% tropicamide (Mydriacyl, Alcon Canada) revealed multiple foci of chorioretinal cellular infiltration and retinal hemorrhage. The ophthalmic diagnosis was a bilateral panuveitis. Differential diagnoses included inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic processes. On physical examination, multiple firm, nonpainful, 2-5 mm in diameter red papules were noted over the entire body (Fig. 2) . Some of the papules were ulcerated. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.",

            "text": "Feline corona viruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route and typically cause mild enteric disease. After natural infection, cats begin to shed virus in their feces within 1 week and continue to shed for weeks or months with some asymptomatic carriers shedding for life. 13 The FIP virus (FIPV) originates by a spontaneous mutation of the FCoV in individual cats often under conditions of immune suppression. 14 FIP most typically occurs in domestic cats between 3 months and 3 years of age 15 and is more common in patients from multicat households, catteries, and shelters. 16 Pure-bred cats have been reported to be at a higher risk of developing FIP. 17 It has been reported that 5-12% of cats seropositive for FCoV eventually develop FIP. 18 There is no effective diagnostic protocol that can discriminate the avirulent FECV from the pathologic FIPV. 16 The antemortem diagnosis of FIP is therefore difficult and should be based on a combination of history, signalment, clinical signs, and clinicopathological changes. 10 Laboratory findings that are common, but not pathognomonic for FIP include lymphopenia, nonregenerative anemia, increased total serum protein concentration, hyperglobulinemia, a low albumin/globulin ratio, high serum concentrations of the acute phase protein a 1 -acid glycoprotein, and high FCoV antibody titers. 19 Typical ocular manifestations of FIP include 'mutton fat' keratic precipitates, hyphema, aqueous flare, and an iridocyclitis/ exudative chorioretinitis that is often accompanied by perivascular retinal granulomas with retinal detachments and optic neuritis. 6 When ocular signs are present, they typically coexist with other systemic signs such as fever, anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, or neurologic signs. 4 The history and clinical findings in this case were supportive of FIP although serum a 1 -acid glycoprotein levels supporting an inflammatory state were not measured and the FCoV antibody titers were at the high end of normal. RT-PCR may have provided additional diagnostic information to support FIP; however, a high percentage of cats that are RT-PCR positive will never develop FIP. 20 The histopathologic demonstration of a pyogranulomatous to mixed perivasculitis is considered the gold standard for a conclusive diagnosis of FIP. 10 The yield of histopathologic lesions in Tru-Cut biopsies (usually from kidney or liver) is low and limits the potential application of this approach for an antemortem diagnosis of FIP. 21 Furthermore, invasive methods (i.e. laparotomy or laparoscopy) are usually necessary to obtain the tissue samples for histopathologic examination.",

Human interferon-a is an immuno-modulatory compound that has been demonstrated in vitro to have a direct antiviral effect protecting against viral replication; 24 however, in vivo experiments failed to demonstrate a reduced mortality in treated cases. 25 Although FIP is invariably progressive and fatal, temporary remission is possible. 26 The skin lesions in this case provided a definitive diagnosis of FIP and were easily visualized due to the lack of haircoat in this breed of cat. While a thorough physical examination is recommended in all cases of uveitis, careful examination and palpation of the skin and clipping of the fur may be rewarding in suspect cases of FIP. If cutaneous lesions are noted in a cat with a high clinical suspicion for FIP, then histopathologic examination of skin biopsies with IHC for intracellular FCoV antigen is strongly advocated.",
