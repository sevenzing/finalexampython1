The effects of substituents, such as -F, -Br and -CH 3 , on the crucial characteristics pertaining to the hybrids were investigated through computational studies. In silico or virtual screening through molecular docking studies on the library of 22 compounds, including reference compounds, precursors, non-hybrid and hybrid derivatives, was performed on DNA G-quadruplex of the human genome. All six freshly synthesized hybrids showed high binding energy as compared to non-hybrids as well as reference compounds. The presence of substituents at 5-position of indole enhanced the binding tendency of the ligand. ADME studies indicated good oral bioavailability and absorption of these compounds. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of hybrids were done at B3LYP/6-311G + + (d,p) level of computation. Their HOMO and LUMO energy plots reflected the presence of high charge transfer and chemical potential. Natural bond order (NBO) calculations predicted hyperconjugative interactions. The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) surface plots showed possible electrophilic and nucleophilic attacking sites of the hybrids. Compound 10 a (5-fluoro-spiro[indol-indazole-thiazolidine]-dione-coumarin hybrid), on the basis of global reactivity descriptors, was filtered to be chemically most reactive with the highest binding energy of \u00c0 8.23 kcal/mol with DNA Gquadruplex.
