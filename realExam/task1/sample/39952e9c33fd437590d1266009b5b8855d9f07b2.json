This finding suggests that China has made key steps towards the interruption of COVID-19 transmission, owing to stringent containment measures, including isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, and strict restrictions on personal movement (appendix pp [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , as well as to increased awareness and behavioural change of the population. At the beginning of the epidemic, COVID-19 cases were mostly observed among elderly people. 12 As the epidemic progressed, we observed a further increase in number of cases among people aged 65 years and older, as well as an increase among younger individuals (<18 years). Since Jan 28, 2020, however, the proportion of confirmed cases that are in people younger than 18 years is still only about 5%, although this age group represents approximately 20% of the Chinese population. 13 From the data available here, it is not possible to ascertain whether younger individuals have a reduced risk of infection or an increased propensity for a milder clinical outcome of infection (thus resulting in a lower rate of detection). Schools in China were closed for most of the epidemic because of the 2020 Chinese New Year holidays; 14 given studies 15 showing that children record the largest number of contacts among all age groups on a regular weekday due to contacts at schools, it is possible that children were less exposed than normal during this time. It is unclear whether nationwide school holidays contributed to the low proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases among school-age individuals and whether reopening of schools will lead to a change in the transmission patterns of COVID-19. 16 At the beginning of the epidemic, a disproportionate fraction of COVID-19 cases were male. 12 As of Feb 17, 2020, however, we observed about the same number of cases among men and women (51% of cases are male). This finding suggests either differential exposure by sex occurring at the beginning of the epidemic (most cases reported possible exposure to live markets because they were shop owners, or worked at or visited the live markets 17, 18 ) or possible bias in the detection of the first few cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 590, "text": "Feb 8, 2020)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 863, "end": 867, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 868, "end": 872, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 873, "end": 877, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2138, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2139, "end": 2143, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2148, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2153, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2154, "end": 2158, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2329, "end": 2331, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2718, "end": 2720, "text": "13", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3062, "end": 3064, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3079, "end": 3081, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3526, "end": 3528, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 3620, "end": 3622, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 3968, "end": 3971, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3972, "end": 3976, "text": "18 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In provinces outside Hubei, we estimated the mean incubation period to be 5\u00b72 days, in agreement with previous studies, 5, [19] [20] [21] although estimates between 4\u00b70 and 6\u00b77 days have been reported. 22, 23 The 95th percentile of the distribution (10\u00b75 days) suggests contact tracing and medical observations of contacts of people with COVID-19 are important to detect individuals with a long incubation period. In these provinces, the mean serial interval was 5\u00b71 days (95% CI 1\u00b73-11\u00b76). This estimate is considerably shorter than a previous estimate (7\u00b75 days) derived from an analysis of six observations of the serial interval in Wuhan. 5 Given that the basic reproduction number is positively associated with the growth rate of the epidemic and the length of the serial interval, 8 the shorter mean serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility might not be as high as initial estimates suggest. We cannot rule out, however, that the serial interval might differ between Wuhan and other Chinese provinces. The short estimate of the serial interval that we obtained might be linked to the short estimate for the interval from symptom onset to hospital admission (with a mean of about 2\u00b76 days since Jan 28) for mainland China outside Hubei. A longer admission delay was reported in Wuhan in the early phase of the outbreak, 5 which could drive longer serial intervals. It should be stressed also that serial interval estimates based on household clusters might be up to 20% shorter than the true value, as suggested by a theoretical study. 10 We estimated that the serial interval was about as long as the incubation period, which is in overall agreement with an independent previous estimate. 5 This finding suggests the possibility of an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 before the onset of symptoms. If confirmed, the presence of relevant presymptomatic transmission might hamper control efforts, including contact tracing and timely isolation of index cases, as well as passenger screening at airports. By contrast, strategies based on social distancing, such as limiting mass gatherings and contact in the workplace and in schools, might still be effective. 15, 24, 25 Evidence is accumulating to indicate the possibility of transmission during the incubation phase. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] It is worth noting also that our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were based on analysis of cluster data, for which we assumed that the risk of infection from the community was negligible compared with that from infected individuals in the cluster. Although this assumption appears to be reasonable given the intensity of contact tracing, community transmission cannot be fully ruled out.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 120, "end": 122, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 123, "end": 127, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 128, "end": 132, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 133, "end": 137, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 202, "end": 205, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 206, "end": 208, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 643, "end": 644, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 787, "end": 788, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1563, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1716, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2225, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2226, "end": 2229, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2230, "end": 2232, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2331, "end": 2335, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2336, "end": 2340, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2341, "end": 2345, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2346, "end": 2350, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2355, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2360, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2365, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results presented thus far support a change in epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak over time and as the epidemic expanded to multiple locations. Many of the key epidemiological time-delay distributions are different from those reported in studies focusing on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan. 5 This difference is probably the consequence of the increased awareness of the public and physicians, behavioural changes of the population with respect to respiratory disease (B) Estimated R t over a 4-day moving average. We excluded the last 9 days of data (ie, data after Feb 8) to account for reporting delays. We estimated the 90th percentile of the distribution of the time from onset to reporting in mainland China outside Hubei province during period 2 of the epidemic to be 9\u00b70 days. R t =net reproduction number. symptoms, increased health-care readiness, and elevated alert and response across mainland China. We estimated that R t followed different patterns across China. We found that the epidemic was self-sustained for short periods of time only (no more than 3 weeks) in provinces outside Hubei that reported a large number of cases, 32 and estimated that, since the end of January, 2020, R t has been below the epidemic threshold in all studied provinces. This finding is consistent with the gradual decrease in the number of detected COVID-19 cases reported across China and suggests a beneficial effect of the strict public health intervention policies implemented in China. In particular, strict social-distancing measures were implemented in all the analysed Chinese provinces and included close community management (eg, case isolation and household quarantine of close contacts), suspension of public activities, traffic restrictions, and school closure. A full list and timeline of the implemented interventions in each of the analysed locations is reported in the appendix (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . It should be stressed that the effectiveness of containment measures only applies while they are in place, and a relaxation of public health interventions or a substantial change in human behaviour might lead to a subsequent increase in transmission. Furthermore, our findings are based on analysis of nine of the most affected provinces in mainland China outside Hubei. Therefore, although unlikely, it is possible that other provinces reporting only a few cases could still have self-sustained outbreaks. Finally, the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections to COVID-19 transmission remains unclear, as does the amount of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission captured in existing datasets. [28] [29] [30] [31] 33, 34 This study is prone to the usual limitations pertaining to analysis of rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks, including biases due to case ascertainment, nonhomogeneous sampling over time and by location, as well as hidden and unmodelled correlations. Thus, the uncertainty might be larger than estimated. Our estimates of R t are most robust, when assuming that under-reporting and the frequency of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission remain constant. Our estimates, however, are sensitive to marked changes in reporting rates and in the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that lead to clinically identifiable symptoms. Individual records were retrieved from different data sources and thus might be affected by geographical differences in sampling of cases with specific exposures (eg, imported or locally acquired infections) and available dates of symptom onset. However, we compared our data for Shenzhen city, Hunan province, and Shandong province with official line lists and found the datasets to be of similar quality. It should also be stressed that the case definition has been changed several times since the start of the epidemic, and in particular, it was broadened on Jan 27. Therefore, because potentially more cases were identified since this change in case definition, our estimate of R t should be considered an upper bound (appendix pp 25, 26) . This finding lends further support to our conclusion that R t has been decreasing since the end of January.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 338, "end": 339, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1192, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1942, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1943, "end": 1947, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1952, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1957, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1958, "end": 1962, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2683, "end": 2687, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2688, "end": 2692, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2693, "end": 2697, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2698, "end": 2702, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2703, "end": 2706, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2709, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4083, "end": 4086, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 4087, "end": 4090, "text": "26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Despite these limitations, a real-time updated patient line list such as the one we have compiled is crucial to assess the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of an emerging pathogen, inform situational awareness, and optimise responses to the outbreak.
