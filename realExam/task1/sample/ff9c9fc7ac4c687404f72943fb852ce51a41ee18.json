Such studies always face the risk of confounding: factors that directly influence both the exposure and (separately) the outcome. Studies of seropositivity and its effect on future infection are particularly prone to confounding because the exposure (a marker of previous infection) and the outcome (future infection) are almost the same event in the same person, separated in time. Thus factors that influence the risk of infection are nearly always potential confounders. For example, individuals in high-risk occupations (e.g., health care workers) are more likely to become seropositive and are more likely to be exposed again once they are seropositive.

People are only connected to individuals in their own community, with the probability of such a connection based on an input parameter in the simulation. For \"well mixed\" communities, every individual is connected to every other within their community, while for simulations with \"clustered\" communities, individuals have a limited number of connections within their community, which creates smaller sub-communities, or \"clusters\", by chance. In these latter simulations, individuals may have varying numbers of actual connections but all have the same expected number. The network graph of a \"well mixed\" community is a complete graph, while that of a \"clustered\" community is a random graph with The disease natural history follows a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Susceptible' (SEIS') model, where under the null hypothesis (i.e. no immunity) those in the S and S' compartments are equally susceptible, while under the alternative hypothesis, those in S' are less susceptible (in principle, perhaps completely immune, but in keeping with prior evidence about coronaviruses, we assume partially immune) (10, 11) . In simulations with partial immunity, we make the simplifying assumption that susceptibility is immediately decreased following the infectious period and remains constant over time.

Once again, the bias is upward because individuals in communities with larger or more advanced epidemics are exposed to higher hazards and are more likely to be seropositive at baseline (Figures 2A-D) . As before, the bias can be removed by stratifying and/or matching, this time on both community and day of enrollment. For analyses with a high infection hazard for any enrolled individuals (e.g., Figures   1B and 1D with different days of enrollment), the estimated hazard ratio is between the ratio + /and the null HR=1. For a high infection hazard, the hazard ratio is closer to the null than the ratio of the force of infection since an individual's hazard is not simply the product of their number of contacts and the force of infection. This is not a bias in the conventional sense, but rather a difference between the ratio + /and the parameter that is estimated by the Cox model.",

This bias can arise from either having multiple days of enrollment over the course of the study by design or by having multiple communities where the outbreak stochastically starts at different times.

This clustering leads to correlations between infection status of particular individuals close together in the network and may be understood as creating multiple smaller (albeit overlapping) \"communities\" within each discrete community.For simulations with one well mixed community with the same day of enrollment for all individuals (top lines ofFigures 1A,1B, and 1D), a crude analysis returns unbiased results. If enrollment occurs on different days(Figures 1A,1B, and 1D, second and third lines), a crude analysis yields an upwardly biased estimate of the hazard ratio, making seropositivity appear harmful. However, matching or stratifying the analysis by day of enrollment removes this bias.With multiple communities (and thus multiple, unconnected epidemics,Figures 1A,1B, and 1D,bottom halves), an unadjusted analysis creates the same upward bias, regardless of whether",

If there are substantially fewer seropositive individuals than seronegative individuals and the risk of infection after enrollment is low (i.e., because of effective control measures), there can be settings with no infections among the seropositive enrollees in some or all strata. In these cases, stratified analyses can lead to unstable results. Matched analyses are thus preferable because they remove this imbalance between the two exposure arms.",
