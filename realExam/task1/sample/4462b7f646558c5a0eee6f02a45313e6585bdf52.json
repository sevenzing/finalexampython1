Similar to the diseases in human and other animals, respiratory diseases are primary related to morbidity and are the result of infection with bacteria, viruses, or both. B. bronchiseptica causes serious respiratory diseases in the swine airway track. However, the B. bronchisepticaspecific bacteriophage has diverse advantages such as decreasing antibiotic overuse and possible therapeutic potential against bacteria.",

Methods Bor-BRP-1 phages were applied 24 h prior to B.bronchiseptica infection (1 \u00d7 10 7 cfu/ml) at several concentrations of bacterial infection. Cells were incubated to detect cytokines and 24 h to detect mucin production. And real-time quantitative PCR was performed to examine related genes expression. To determine the change of total gene expression based on B.bronchiseptica and Bor-BRP-1 treatment, we performed RNA sequencing experiments.",

In addition, microarrays detected Bor-BRP-1-altered inflammatory gene expression against B. bronchiseptica, reducing B. bronchiseptica-induced airway inflammation in swine epithelial cells. Conclusion These results suggest that the specific bacteriophage has a therapeutic potential to defend against B. bronchiseptica infection by altering inflammatory gene expression profiles.",

In particular, it is one of the primary causative agents of atrophic rhinitis and bronchopneumonia in swine (Moore and Kern 2001; Pr\u00fcller et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2019) . The characteristic lesion of atrophic rhinitis is atrophy of the nasal septum and turbinate, leading to facial deformation (Petrovic et al. 2017; De Jong and Nielsen 1990; Brockmeier et al. 2002) . This impairs swine feeding and causes a reduction in growth performance resulting in great economic losses in the pig-rearing industry.",

B. bronchiseptica infection predisposes the upper respiratory tract to colonization with secondary pathogens including P. multocida and S. suis (Brockmeier 2004; P\u00f3sa et al. 2011) . P. multocida inefficiently colonizes by itself, while B. bronchiseptica acts as a precursor for infection with P. multocida. In addition, preinoculation with B. bronchiseptica prior to S. suis resulted in elevated isolation of S. suis as well as increased incidence of pneumonia and mortality in pigs (Mengelers et al. 1989; Vecht et al. 1992) . Presentation of B. bronchiseptica-infected mammalian animals can vary from asymptomatic cases to severe systemic infections. Generally, this infection leads to life-long chronic colonization in the host. Once infected, the infection is rarely eliminated from the host (Irie et al. 2005) .",

After proliferation, the phages escape from the bacteria by destroying the bacterial cell wall (Forde and Fitzgerald 1999; Hermoso et al. 2007; Pepin et al. 2008) . Phages are very specific and can only selectively kill the target bacteria, not affecting other bacteria such as normal flora in animals (Leverentz et al. 2003; Rees and Dodd 2006) . Although B. bronchiseptica was first reported in 1911, several studies have been performed with its bacteriophages. Several reports have revealed that B. bronchiseptica is isolated through antibiotic resistance to \u03b2-lactams, macrolides, etc. (Petrovic et al. 2017; Pr\u00fcller et al. 2015; Biswas et al. 2002; Dayao et al. 2014; Niemann et al. 2018) .

The library was constructed using a Quant-Seq 3\u2032 mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit (Lexogen, Inc., Austria) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 500 ng of total RNA was prepared, an oligo-dT primer containing an Illumina-compatible sequence at its 5\u2032 end was hybridized to the RNA, and reverse transcription was applied. After RNA template degradation, second-strand synthesis was initiated by a random primer containing an Illumina-compatible linker sequence at its 5\u2032 end. The double-stranded library was purified using magnetic beads for removal of all reaction components. The library was amplified to add the complete adapter sequences required for cluster generation. The finished library was purified from PCR components. High-throughput sequencing was performed as single-end 75 sequencing using NextSeq 500 (Illumina, Inc., USA). For data analysis, QuantSeq 3\u2032 mRNA-Seq reads were aligned using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) . Bowtie2 indices were either generated from the genome assembly sequence or the representative transcript sequences for aligning to the genome and transcriptome. The alignment file was used for assembling transcripts, estimating their abundances, and detecting differential expression of genes. Differentially expressed genes were determined based on counts from unique and multiple alignments using coverage in Bedtools (Quinlan 2010) . The Read Count data were processed based on the quantile normalization method using EdgeR within R using Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. 2004 ). Gene classification was based on searches in Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http:// david .abcc.ncifc rf.gov/) and Medline databases (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

Second, we verified a protective effect of the bacteriophage as pretreatment to bacterial infection, but we did not evaluate the bacteriophage effect after bacterial infection. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether the bacteriophage could eliminate the bacteria after infection with or without antibiotic withdrawal.",

Importantly, Bor-BRP-1 did not affect the viability of the host cells and could be a powerful alternative medicine to B. bronchiseptica-induced airway inflammation. Future studies will be performed to identify the intracellular mechanism of bacterial elimination according to phage challenge.",
