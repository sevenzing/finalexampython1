We divide the regions into different risk categories and discuss anomalies. The worst cases are confined between the Appenine and the Alps mountain ranges but the situation seem to improve closer to the sea. The Veneto region gave the most efficient response so far and some of their resources could be diverted to other regions, in particular, more tests to the Lombardia, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V. Aosta regions, which seem to be worst affected. We noticed worrying anomalies in the Lazio, Campania and Sicilia regions to be monitored. We stress that the number of fatalities we predicted on March 12 has been confirmed daily by the bulletins. This suggests a change of strategy in order to reduce such number maybe moving the weaker population (and negative to the virus test) to beach resorts, which should be empty presently. The ratio deceased/positives on April 4, 2020 is 5.4% worldwide, 12.3% in Italy, 1.4% in Germany, 2.7% in the USA, 10.3% in the UK and 4.1% in China. These large fluctuations should be investigated starting from the Italian regions, which show similar large fluctuations.",

They start in one or more localized places and quickly spread over larger and larger regions until it becomes difficult to stop them. After that the spread continues to 'affect' more and more regions until there is some 'fuel', i.e., palm trees for the Red Weevil or woods for the fire. This mechanism is similar to physical systems, for instance turbulent flow or chaotic maps [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , where a small perturbation grows exponentially and then saturates to a finite value. These at first sht different systems have some common features: a small perturbation, which we will indicate as d 0 , grows exponentially with a coefficient \u03b3, the Lyapunov exponent, and finally saturates [1] [2] [3] to a value d \u221e d 0 . The fact that every chaotic system saturates to a finite value, even though might be very large, indicates that the 'phase-space' is, however, limited and reflects some conservation laws, such as energy conservation for a physical a e-mail: abonasera@comp.tamu.edu (corresponding author) ",

Equation (1) is the logistic equation first introduced by Verhulst [8] as a model of population growth. It is the solution of a simple first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation. In Ref. [2] , it was introduced to study the transition to turbulent flow, Eq. (26.7) 2 . It is also the continuous version of the logistic map [1, 4] . In a recent paper [7] , we have analyzed the 2003 SARS and the COVID-19 viruses using the equation written above and fitting the three parameters to the data. Despite its simplicity (for instance, it lacks a proper accounting of the spatial spreading of the pandemics), the model reproduces the data very well on a daily basis starting from March 12 for the Italy case [7] . This might be coincidental but it is further supported by the analysis of the virus spread in other countries [7] .",

The different regions are indicated by different colors and/or symbols. The reason for each color will be discussed more in detail later and we have divided them into the dark red, red, blue, cyan, and green colors depending on the probability to find a positive to the virus in that region. So dark red gives the highest probability while green is the lowest. Notice that the Lombardy, Veneto and E. Romagna regions performed the most test. The other important feature to notice is the change of slope after day 10 (starting from February 24,2020), which means that after that day the number of tests performed daily more than doubled. This change on the number of tests and the different number for different countries or regions make it difficult to make predictions on absolute values such as the total number of positives to the virus or any other quantities. Thus it is statistically more relevant to define probabilities from the ratio of positives divided by the total number of tests or the number of fatalities divided by the total number of tests, etc.",

In the Fig. 2 , we show the results of the fit by fixing the parameters on March 12, 2020. A previous fit after the start of As we saw in Fig. 1 after about 10 days the number of tests was more than doubled and also quarantine measures were taken by the Italian government. This led to the new fit on March 12 given by the cyan points in the figure. Since then we have not modified the fit but just added the new daily points which seem to follow the new fit for the positives up to April 4, 2020. As we can see there seem to be a decrease for the last points. A decrease from the prediction means that the probability to be positive to the virus is decreasing and social distancing plus other measures are producing good results. If we now analyze the fatalities, we first of all notice that the original prediction is followed by the data and we did not need to perform a new fit on March 12 at variance with the number of positives. Furthermore, the probability for fatalities seems to follow the prediction and little or no decrease is observed. Another important quantity plotted is the ratio deceased/positives, which should be somewhat independent on the total number of tests if the method to choose the people to be tested does not change. As we can see the ratio keeps increasing and becomes larger than 10%. This is much higher than Germany for instance, which has a large number of positives as well and can be statistically compared to Italy. Other countries like Spain and UK show similar values for the ratio like Italy. These large fluctuations might be attributed to the different health facilities, ventilators, hospital overcrowding, etc. It is important to coordinate the action in different countries to try to understand the reason for the discrepancies and save many lives.",

If taken literally this result would imply that hospitals should not admit more than 694 \u00b1 56 people daily, however as discussed above for the total number of tests, this plot would be more meaningful if we would know how many patients can the hospital accommodate in normal and safe conditions.

We could in principle apply the same equation to the number of positives for instance without normalizing by the total number of tests. We have shown that this procedure might be meaningless if the number of tests performed daily changes or varies from region to region. However, from Fig. 1 we notice that after day 10 the test number is a straight line, which implies that it is constant. Thus we may hope that Eq. (1) includes the trivial increase of daily tests in the three parameters and try to make predictions. This rather empirical method to predict the evolution of the spread might be justified only by the results. Once we get some confidence for some cases we can apply it to other cases keeping in mind that the total number of tests daily must be constant.",

For shorter times (below day 10), the model disagrees with the data due to the fact that the number of tests performed daily increased. Thus the prediction of Fig. 4 should be taken with caution and we hope that at least the order of magnitude is correct. Refitting on April 5, 2020 increased the predictions to 1.43e5 \u00b1 1625 (1.35e5), 17,904 \u00b1 296 (16,162) and 28,556 \u00b1 889 (20,954) for positives, fatalities and dismissed respectively (in parentheses the values of the fit on March 31, 2020). The values of the fits performed at different times are different which suggests that the model is better suited to predict the initial spread of the virus.

These results must be clarified since if this probability would reflect the actual population then 1 person out of 2 carries the virus. This is not the case since the method to choose the people to be tested is biased, i.e., those who show strong signs of infections are tested until there are no more tests available.

The fits were performed using Eq. 1 and following the method explained in the previous sections. All the fits were performed on March 31, 2020. Different regions were grouped with different colors and symbols in the figure in order to distinguish them according to the probability. The regions with the highest probability are Lombardy, Liguria, Piemonte, Marche and V.Aosta. Some might come as a surprise but recall that we are plotting the positives divided by the total number of tests. The Veneto region, which is one of the most affected, is represented by the green color, one of the lowest probabilities. This is due to the high number of tests performed in that region as shown in Fig. 1 . Comparing Figs. 1 and 8 one could find reasons to shift resources as needed. As a preliminary method, we should shift resources from regions, which have less than 15% probability (below the cyan color in the figure) to be infected to higher probability regions. This could be done on a temporary basis, say for a week to see if the probabilities, for the most affected regions, decrease. Of course, ideally to increase the total number of tests everywhere would be the best solution. A probability say of 30% means that almost 1 person out of 3 is affected, thus even in apartments with more than 3 persons living in it, social distancing and other precautions should be enforced. This virus might be asymptomatic, i.e., we might carry it and show no signs, thus the importance to obtain better estimates of the probabilities.",

This is most probably due to hospital overcrowding and lack of enough tools like ventilators and sufficient personal protection equipment especially for the medical staff, which is in the front line. We cannot exclude that hospitals are a possible source of the infection, maybe the use of other public buildings transformed into temporary hospitals might help. Moving higher risk people, still negative to the virus, to lower density places like beach resorts might help. It is especially important in our opinion to put the different resources of the regions together to understand the spread more effectively. For instance, regions with a lower probability of infection (less than 15%) might send some of their testing equipment, unused ventilators and maybe some medical personnel to higher risk regions on a temporary basis. Ventilators and personal protection equipment are the most needed tools. The country of cars, as well as electronics and fashion, might divert some industrial capabilities to fulfill the emergency in short times. The more we wait the more people dies.",
