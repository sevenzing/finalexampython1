The current method of detection involves a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False-negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19.",

These species include the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), along with less virulent species that include NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1 [4] . The epidemiology, etiology, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have recently been described in detail [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The current methods of diagnosis of COVID-19 includes detection of the virus by genomic techniques using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods or deep sequencing [7, 12, 13] . However, these detection methods heavily rely on the presence of the viral genome in sufficient amounts at the site of sample collection that can be amplified. Missing the time window of viral replication can provide false-negative results. Similarly, an incorrect sample collection can limit the usefulness of the quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based assay. A false-negative diagnosis can have grave consequences, especially at this stage of the pandemic, by allowing infected patients to spread the infection and hampering the efforts to contain the spread of the virus [14] . In such conditions, additional screening methods that can detect the presence of infection despite lower viral titers can be highly beneficial to ensure timely diagnosis of all infected patients.",

Compared with the titers at days 0-7 (GMT, 400), the IgM antibody levels increased between days 8 and 14 (GMT, 535.8; P = .000; Student's t test) but did not increase further between days 15 and 21 (GMT, 536.31; P = .992) or after day 21 (GMT, 565.69; P = .719). IgA antibody levels increased from days 0-7 (GMT, 400) to days 8-14 (GMT, 597.24; P = .000); however, there was no increase after this time point (GMT at day 15-21 = 723.28, P = .156; or GMT at day >21 = 831.41, P = .538). The IgG antibodies were detected on days 0-7 (GMT, 490.45), increased on days 8-14 (GMT, 1325.6; P = .000), continued to increase until days 15-21 (GMT, 2690.87; P = .000), and reached a plateau by day 21 (GMT, 2974.83; P = .72).",

Further, we fitted curves of the PCR-positive rate and IgG and IgM ELISA positive rates on different days after symptom onset ( Figure 4B ). The detection rates between days 26 and 39 PSO are not shown due to the limited number of patients on each day. Based on the fitted curve, the PCR-positive rate was more than 90% on 1-3 days PSO, then declined to less than 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 57.1-95.7%) at day 6 and less than 50% (95% CI, 23.7-59.5%) after 14 days PSO. Overall, the detection rate by qPCR was higher than the IgM ELISA before 5.5 days PSO, while the detection efficiency by IgM ELISA was higher than that of the PCR method after 5.5 days of symptom onset. Overall, the positive detection rate was only 51.9% in a single PCR test, but significantly increased (98.6%) when an IgM ELISA assay was applied to PCR-negative patients ( Figure 4C ). To further evaluate the performance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM in COVID-19 diagnosis, we analyzed the data from the 26 CCs who had 2 serial plasma samples together with paired throat swabs within a 4-day interval. Among them, 7 patients were PCR negative when testing the first swab, but 6 patients were IgM positive. All 7 patients were PCR positive for the second swab. These results suggest that IgM ELISA can increase the positive detection rate when combined with the PCR method and can be used for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infections.",

The grandmother started having symptoms including fever (38.0\u2103) and dry cough, and chest computed tomography (CT) showed a bilateral patchy shadow on 2 February. The grandfather experienced a stuffy and runny nose on 3 February. The other 4 members in the family had no significant clinical symptoms. The PCR assay and chest CT of their close contacts, including their daughter, son-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter, were performed on 5 February. The grandmother was found to be positive on viral RNA detection by qPCR. The grandfather and daughter only presented abnormal findings on chest CT but were negative for viral RNA when tested by PCR. The grandson presented with PCR positivity with a normal chest CT. The son-in-law and granddaughter were PCR negative and showed normal lungs by CT imaging. The grandfather, daughter, son-in-low, and granddaughter were also negative for SARS-CoV-2 after the repeat PCR on the next day. However, the IgM antibodies were detected in the grandmother, grandfather, daughter, grandson, and granddaughter. These findings indicate the significant and improved efficacy of COVID-19 detection when IgM measurements are used to assess subclinical subjects.",

This method often fails to detect the viral infection if the collection procedure is not optimal, or if the patient has low viral load due to an early stage of the disease or suppression by host immunity, or if the samples were obtained at a late stage in the course of infection.",

Second, the number of infections with SARS-CoV was limited to 8096 worldwide [18] , which only represents a tiny fraction of the Chinese population.

Two patients were severe cases and their samples were collected at 19 and 22 days after symptom onset, respectively, suggesting a possible failure of these patients to generate the antibody response, which may have contributed to the disease severity.

Moreover, after a variable period of time, one expects the PCR result to become negative as people stop shedding viruses. Presumably, IgG antibodies will remain positive. This would permit the use of serological tools to better understand the overall rate of infection in the community-including the rate of asymptomatic infections. This could potentially enable us to identify healthcare workers who have been infected in the past and might be less prone to becoming infected on the job. Our data also show the ability to detect subclinical infections effectively, a much-needed tool to stop the spread of infection, which is currently spreading at an alarming rate in Europe and the United States.
