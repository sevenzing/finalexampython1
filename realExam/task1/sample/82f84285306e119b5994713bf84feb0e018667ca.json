            "text": "On average 5.3 viruses per year, of which 60%-70% are human pathogens, have emerged from 1940 to 2004 [1] . In a rapidly evolving pandemic, therapeutic options must be available quickly. Use of convalescent plasma transfusions could be of great value in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease , given the lack of specific preventative and therapeutic options. This convalescent plasma therapy is of particular interest when a vaccine or specific therapy is not yet available for emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Response to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases throughout history has included rapid scientific collaborations to develop specific vaccines or therapies. To that end, currently, there is a large global trial supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), SOLIDARITY, to investigate existing therapies for COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and ritonavir, and lopinavir + ritonavir + interferon-beta. In addition, there is broad interest to leverage convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients as treatment or for prophylaxis of health care workers and other caregivers. The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has released guidance for investigation of convalescent plasma in the United States for COVID-19 [2] . Additionally, historic data has reported safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma for use in other infectious diseases, and there is also new data on convalescent plasma use in the current global public health emergency specifically to treat COVID-19.",

            "text": "The transfusion of convalescent blood products is not a new clinical tool in emerging infectious disease outbreaks (Fig. 1]) . Historically, passive immune therapy has involved convalescent whole blood, convalescent plasma, pooled human immunoglobulin for intravenous or intramuscular administration, high-titer human immunoglobulin, and polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies; however, plasma collected by apheresis is currently the preferred therapy [3] . Use of blood products from recovered patients dates back to the late 1800s [4] . The Spanish influenza (pandemic of 1918-1920) was the first viral infection for which convalescent blood products were found to be potentially https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2020.102790 effective during clinical studies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] A meta-analysis of 8 studies of the Spanish flu (1703 patients) showed reduced mortality from treatment with convalescent blood products [12] . The possibility of using convalescent plasma for prevention and/or treatment was of interest during the recent West African Ebola outbreak due to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, highly infectious nature of the virus, and high associated case-fatality rate [13] . Several other emerging infectious diseases, such as West Nile Virus, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, and H1N1 have also been the target of possible passive immunity with convalescent plasma. Despite a long history of convalescent plasma usage, clinical efficacy has not been studied robustly and conclusions are weak, likely because convalescent plasma was used in critical situations, during massive epidemic/pandemic outbreaks, requiring immediate actions. The effectiveness of this convalescent plasma therapy appears to differ depending on the pathogen and treatment protocols (eg, timing, volume, and dosing of administration). There have been several publications on convalescent plasma use for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, including reviews/editorials, observational studies (retrospective, prospective, or case series), and a systematic literature review [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

[23] The virus may cause B lymphocyte reduction (and IL-6 reduction) early in the disease, which may affect antibody production. Lymphocytes may continue to decline over the course of disease, and inflammatory cytokines increase. Hence, therapies should focus on 1) enhancement of the immune function of patients and 2) inhibiting the formation of inflammatory cytokine storms.

Some seriously ill patients in China who received convalescent plasma therapy resulted in improved oxygenation and reduced inflammation and viral load [16, 27] . In this pilot study, 9 patients received 1 dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibody titers of > 1:640. The median time from onset of illness to convalescent plasma transfusion was 16.5 days. Within 3 days, the patients showed improved clinical symptoms along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation. Lymphocyte counts increased from 0.65 \u00d7 10 9 /L to 0.76 \u00d7 10 9 /mL and C-reactive protein decreased from 55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L. The neutralizing antibody in recipients increased in all patients and the viral load was undetectable in 7 of the 9 patients who had previous viremia.",

Additionally, several viral diseases, such as Dengue virus and SARS, may cause immune enhancement of pathogenicity in the presence of certain antibodies [22, 24] . However, there is safety data from the use of convalescent plasma in patients with SARS and MERS, and anecdotal evidence from its use in 245 patients with COVID-19 [19, 26] . This should be a consideration in the risk-benefit assessment. Effective convalescent plasma should contain high-titer specific antibodies which bind to SARSCoV-2 and neutralize the viral particles, block access to uninfected cells, and activate potent effector mechanisms [25] .",
