Since then, radical changes took place in the organization and the daily care priorities of the Italian Health System. Our Institution represents one of the main COVID Hospitals in the Lazio region. We heavily reduced our routine clinical activities, but we are able to preserve part of the hospital as COVIDfree, thanks to structural and logistical facilities arrangements. Considering the virus' homing and that a significant number of skull base pathologies require a transnasal endoscopic approach, safety for both patients and medical providers is obviously considered of paramount importance. We would like to focus on the transnasal endoscopic skull base surgery adding information and sharing our experience in comment to the paper of Zoia et al. [8] .",

All the patients scheduled for surgery are prehospitalized 24 h prior to the admission: vital signs and body temperature are recorded, and a detailed History and Physical is taken. A rapid blood test (IgM and IgG for COVID-19) and nasal and pharyngeal swab are performed. Patients negative to the first rapid test and to the swab test are admitted to the COVID-free Neurosurgical Unit, so they can be operated on the following day. Conversely, patients with positive rapid and swab test are referred to a COVID+ Department. The planned surgical procedure is postponed, if possible, after the resolution of the infection and the full recovery of the patient. In patients requiring urgent surgery, we adopted our Institutional protocol for surgical emergencies in COVID+ patients.

Endoscopic tower, camera, light cable, and 4 k monitor are draped (Fig. 2 ). Patient face, mouth, and nostrils are draped with an additional layer of transparent steri-drape. In this way, the endoscope and the surgical instruments passed through the drape can minimize the potential aerosolization (Fig. 1) . The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory for the members of the surgical team, in particular a properly fitted, molded, and handled FFP3 mask plus surgical mask, eye protection (goggles/full face shield), impermeable scrub, and double gloves (level 3 protection [2, 4, 6] ). We adopt endonasal transsphenoidal 4 hands technique with both surgeons on the same side of the bed (see Figs. 1 and 2) . Only the surgeons are potentially exposed to the aerosol, significantly reducing the risk of contamination (see Fig. 1 ). During surgery, the use of nasal pledgets is minimized, and the drilling and use of rongeurs for bone removal are avoided; in summary, try to reduce as much as possible any aerosol-generating procedures [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] . Avoid nasal packing and use re-absorbable materials, in order to avoid cough or gagging during removal. Start nasal rinse with saline solution on post-operative days. If no major or minor complications occur after 3 days, the patient is managed in a COVID + Medical Unit and subsequently discharged for home quarantine. Nasal endoscopic assessment is performed 2 weeks after surgery, using all the precautions recommended for COVID+ patients. An environment with all the protections (level 3) for the ENT surgeons and nurse is designated, requiring the patient to come at the scheduled time wearing the appropriate protections [4, 7] .",
