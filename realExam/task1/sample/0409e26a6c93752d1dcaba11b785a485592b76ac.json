The first variable of the score is absence of headache. It has been reported that although headache is not one of the Centor criteria, it is a commonly looked for symptom of strep throat and is associated with GABHS infection in both children and adults (11) . Stuffy nose and sneezing are the most common symptoms caused by respiratory viruses. Although rhinovirus, the most common virus, is not thought to cause fever, Bellei et al. (12) reported a 50.5% incidence of fever in rhinovirus related cases in their study. This is in agreement with the Mistik Score's fever criterion. The presence of the fever variable in both bacterial and viral scores is possible because fever is observed in both kinds of infections. Also, the difference in the temperature levels may explain how fever may be present in both scores. Exudative tonsillitis is commonly associated with ADV, EBV, and GABHS infection, although influenza virus, parainfluenza virus or enteroviruses have been reported (13) (14) (15) . We had few cases of ADV and enterovirus infections or influenza and parainfluenza infections in our study. However, the absence of tonsillar exudates is a criterion of the Mistik Score. The limitation of this study was that we did not ask the doctors in the study to change their routine practice and only prescribe antibiotics according to culture results. This resulted in a high antibiotic prescription rate of 74.8% in the presence of an 18.5% GABHS infection rate. Another limitation of this study was that it was designed to identify only GABHS and 16 respiratory viruses. Certain bacteria that are sometimes found in sore throat, such as group B, C and G streptococci (Streptococcus dysgalactiae spp. equisimilis, Streptococcus anginosus group), fusobacterium (F. necrophorum) and also some other viral causes like herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were not identified in our study (16) . These might have been the cause of sore throat in cases in which no germs were identified. However, it has been stated that in 20% to 65% (average 30%) of patients with pharyngitis, no infectious pathogen can be found (16) .This suggests to us that examining these microorganisms may only provide an increase of approximately 10%, or no increase in the identification rate in clinical practice.

In this patient, the Modified Centor Score may only suggest presumed viral infection. However, the Mistik Score has proven viral infection with PCR analysis results (61.9%-70.7%, with a score of four). If this patient had a fever of >38.0\u00b0C, this would make the Modified Centor Score two, and the Mistik Score would be five. It is possible to determine that the infection is 82.1% viral by using the Mistik Score.
