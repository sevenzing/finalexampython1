            "text": "This review summarises the role that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species play in demyelination, such as that occurring in the inflammatory demyelinating disorders multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (e.g. superoxide, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite) can increase dramatically under conditions such as inflammation, and this can overwhelm the inherent antioxidant defences within lesions. Such oxidative and/or nitrative stress can damage the lipids, proteins and nucleic acids of cells and mitochondria, potentially causing cell death. Oligodendrocytes are more sensitive to oxidative and nitrative stress in vitro than are astrocytes and microglia, seemingly due to a diminished capacity for antioxidant defence, and the presence of raised risk factors, including a high iron content. Oxidative and nitrative stress might therefore result in vivo in selective oligodendrocyte death, and thereby demyelination. The reactive species may also damage the myelin sheath, promoting its attack by macrophages. Damage can occur directly by lipid peroxidation, and indirectly by the activation of proteases and phospholipase A 2 . Evidence for the existence of oxidative and nitrative stress within inflammatory demyelinating lesions includes the presence of both lipid and protein peroxides, and nitrotyrosine (a marker for peroxynitrite formation). The neurological deficit resulting from experimental autoimmune demyelinating disease has generally been reduced by trial therapies intended to diminish the concentration of reactive oxygen species. However, therapies aimed at diminishing reactive nitrogen species have had a more variable outcome, sometimes exacerbating disease.",

            "text": "Cells within the nervous system are routinely exposed to low concentrations of potentially deleterious reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, but these normally pose little threat since cells possess an arsenal of defence and repair mechanisms. However, events such as inflammation can conspire to increase the production of these reactive species dramatically, and this may overwhelm the cell's defences resulting in a condition known as oxidative and/or nitrative \"stress\". Such stress may lead to changes in the properties of the cell's constituent molecules, notably the lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. The ROS and RNS of primary concern are the superoxide anion (O2 \u2022-, hereafter called superoxide), nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide, \u2022 NO) \u0854 , peroxynitrite (ONOO -; a product of the combination of superoxide and nitric oxide), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), and the hydroxyl radical ( \u2022 OH). Other potentially important species include singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), nitrogen dioxide radical (NO 2 \u2022 ), nitrosonium (NO + ) and nitronium (NO 2 + ) ions, the perhydroxyl radical (HO 2 \u2022 ), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), but since there is little direct evidence so far that these species play an important role in demyelination, they will not be discussed in this review. The reactions initiated by the reactive species include peroxidation of lipids, nitrosylation of thiol groups, nitration of tyrosine, and oxidation and deamination of nucleic acids. Reactions such as these may directly, or indirectly, result in demyelination. If this is correct, then novel therapies for demyelinating disorders may arise from the introduction of strategies aimed at modifying the production and fate of ROS and RNS. This review describes the evidence that ROS and RNS play a role in demyelination, the mechanisms believed to be involved, and observations made from trial therapies in demyelinating disorders.",

            "text": "The CNS is inherently vulnerable to damage mediated by ROS. First, it is very active in oxidative metabolism. Such activity results in a relatively high intracellular production of superoxide, since 2-5% of the oxygen consumed in mitochondrial electron transport is converted to superoxide. Superoxide is converted by the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen (98). Hydrogen peroxide is normally reduced to water by the action of catalase or glutathione peroxidase (with reduced glutathione as co-substrate), but in the presence of decompartmentalised transition metals such as iron and copper it can be converted to the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (98). This radical is so reactive that it has a diffusion radius of only approximately 0.3 nm before it interacts with another molecule (11). For comparison, the interlamellar spacing of myelin is approximately 10 nm. Second, the CNS has a very limited ability to conduct anaerobic glycolysis, and so it is unusually vulnerable to hypoxia. This is a concern since the production of superoxide by mitochondria increases dramatically in low oxygen concentrations (reviewed in (10)). Third, some cells in the CNS, notably oligodendrocytes, have relatively low levels of antioxidant defences combined with a high iron content and extensive elaborations of membranes. These features all predispose oligodendrocytes, in particular, to oxidative damage. Finally, myelin membrane is a preferential target of ROS (24) due to its composition and high lipid to protein ratio.",

            "text": "Cells employ a range of defence mechanisms to protect themselves from oxidative and nitrative injury. The strategy includes mechanisms to limit the production of reactive species, to scavenge any radicals that are produced, to prevent the proliferation of secondary radicals in chain reactions, and to repair the damage that may nevertheless occur. This strategy is achieved by the presence of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, and low molecular weight antioxidants such as glutathione and dietary vitamins C and E. There are two forms of SOD. Mn-SOD is located in mitochondria, and Cu/Zn-SOD is located within the cytosol. Both isoforms specifically catalyse the dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, thereby protecting cells from the formation of the more harmful peroxynitrite. Glutathione peroxidase is an important cytosolic selenium-containing enzyme which converts peroxides, notably hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides, to water and oxygen. The enzyme requires reduced glutathione as an electron donor. Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide in peroxisomes to water and oxygen. Glutathione is pivotal to oxidative defence and performs the non-specific reduction of many ROS and RNS. It can also reactivate some enzymes which have been inhibited by exposure to oxidants. Glutathione is found at high concentrations in cells, particularly in astrocytes (~5 mM) (230) . Vitamin C (ascorbate) is another important, non-specific antioxidant, which accumulates in the CNS particularly in astrocytes (up to 10 mM) (208, 209) . Vitamin C can regenerate glutathione and vitamin E from their radicals in vitro, returning them to the antioxidant pool. Vitamin E (\u2423-tocopherol) is a lipid soluble antioxidant, and forms a primary defence against lipid peroxidation. It can break the chain reactions of lipid peroxidation by reducing peroxyl radicals. The chemical biology of ROS and RNS has been reviewed in detail elsewhere (98, 186, 249) .",

However \u2022 NO reacts rapidly with some molecules, particularly transition metals and other free radicals, and these reactions can lead to the formation of more damaging species (12). \u2022 NO has a short half-life (~1 second) in tissues. The chemistry of \u2022 NO and its derivatives is complex (reviewed in (11, 12, 14, 59)). Notably, \u2022 NO combines with superoxide to form the potent oxidising and nitrating agent, peroxynitrite. The rate constant for this reaction is sufficiently high that \u2022 NO out-competes SOD for superoxide (110). However, the relatively high concentration of SOD in the cell usually means that intracellular superoxide concentrations are kept sufficiently low that peroxynitrite formation is normally minimal. Under some conditions, however, such as during the oxidative burst, excess superoxide is produced and then extracellular peroxynitrite formation can be substantial (for review see (12)). Peroxynitrite is very reactive, and has a short half-life (milliseconds) in tissues. There is evidence that reaction of peroxynitrite in the presence of carbon dioxide enhances its nitrating properties. In fact, it is now believed that many of the deleterious effects ascribed to \u2022 NO may in reality be due to peroxynitrite and the agents derived from it (including peroxynitrous acid, hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen dioxide radicals, and the nitronium ion). Therefore, reference to \" \u2022 NO\" in this review should not be taken to exclude its metabolic derivatives (i.e. peroxynitrite etc.).",

However, since the microglial cell may itself be impaired by such \u2022 NO concentrations, it appears first to render itself resistant to the effects of \u2022 NO: these measures are instituted in response to even low LPS concentrations (222) . Furthermore, and presumably in an effort to avoid the toxicity of peroxynitrite, it appears that cells which can produce both superoxide and \u2022 NO tend to stagger their production so that both radicals are not produced at the same time. In part this may be achieved by the inhibition by \u2022 NO of the factors involved in superoxide production, and in part by the fact that the agents which stimulate \u2022 NO production typically do not also stimulate superoxide production (see (44) for discussion). However, it seems likely that this ingenious protection will be compromised in areas of inflammation, populated as they are by different types of cell presumably sometimes at different stages of activation. If so, then peroxynitrite formation may be anticipated in inflammatory lesions within the nervous system, and, indeed, there is evidence for this in MS lesions (see nitrotyrosine labelling under \"MS\" below).",

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and neuritis (EAN) are primarily T cell-mediated inflammatory disorders of the CNS and PNS which serve as models of MS and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) respectively. Increased proinflammatory cytokine expression has been demonstrated in both EAE (146) and EAN (220) , implying that increased \u2022 NO production is likely to occur. Indeed, increased iNOS expression has been demonstrated in the CNS of animals with EAE. By measuring \u2022 NO levels directly using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Lin et al. (136) found a statistically significant increases in the signal associated with iron-nitrosyl complexes in the spinal cords of mice with adoptive transfer EAE. Exogenously applied spin-traps have also been utilised with EPR to demonstrate increased \u2022 NO in the spinal cords of animals with both adoptive transfer (106) and actively induced (105) EAE. Unfortunately, absolute levels of \u2022 NO are difficult to determine, but these studies suggest that the level of \u2022 NO in the spinal cord in passsive EAE lies between 6 and 30 M (105, 106). This concentration is high ( \u2022 NO functions as a physiological messenger at nanomolar concentrations), and higher than that at which \u2022 NO has effects on axonal conduction (183) (see below). Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction techniques (RT-PCR) (55, 130, 167) and ribonuclease protection assay (55), a significant increase (up to 10-30 fold) in iNOS mRNA has been demonstrated in the CNS of animals during the acute phase of adoptive transfer (55) or actively induced (130, 167) EAE. In contrast to animals with passive transfer EAE (55), animals with MBP-induced EAE demonstrate a second phase of iNOS up-regulation during the chronic phase of the disease (167) , but this is not matched by a concomitant decline in neurological signs. Immunohistochemical techniques have revealed both increased iNOS expression in the spinal cords of mice with EAE (57, 167, 235), and immunoreactivity for nitrotyrosine, indicating the presence of peroxynitrite and its derivatives in the lesions (56, 57, 235).",

In recent years it has become clear that the inflammatory response can play an important part in the pathophysiology of inflammatory demyelinating diseases (156, 258) . The data suggest that inflammation can cause axonal conduction block, and that this can lead to significant symptomatology in these conditions. How inflammation causes conduction block in human disease is not known, but recent studies in our laboratory (183) have demonstrated that \u2022 NO, or its derivatives, can block conduction in central and peripheral axons in vivo, and similar observations have been made by Shrager's group in vitro (204) . Interestingly, we found that demyelinated axons were especially vulnerable to \u2022 NO -mediated block, and that this effect was observed at concentrations of \u2022 NO anticipated at sites of inflammation (183) . These observations raise the intriguing possibility that \u2022 NO production may be responsible for some of the symptoms in MS and other inflammatory demyelinating disorders. If so, then strategies to lower \u2022 NO concentrations may form an effective therapy for patients with MS. The mechanism(s) underlying \u2022 NO -mediated conduction block are not yet known, but may involve direct effects of \u2022 NO on ion channels. The redox state of thiols is well known to affect the conduction properties of axons (reviewed in (188) ), and several studies have shown that \u2022 NO can act as a modulator of ion channel currents. Consistent with such findings, \u2022 NO has been found to inhibit both action potential discharge (143) and sodium currents in baroreceptor neurons (135). \u2022 NO also affects currents through Ca ++ -dependent potassium channels (22), photoreceptor Ca ++ channels and glutamate ionotropic channels (71). Actions of \u2022 NO involving cGMP are well known (74), but these effects appear to be independent of cGMP, and are apparently due to direct interaction with the channel (see also (39)). Surprisingly, the block of axonal conduction observed in vitro was dependent upon an intact nerve sheath (204) . This observation argues against a direct effect of \u2022 NO on ion channels, and the authors proposed a mechanism where an endoneurial intermediate molecule may react with \u2022 NO and then with the ion channel.",

Cultured human microglia activated by phorbol myristate acetate are especially potent in superoxide production in comparison with other species (43) see also (227) , and production is significantly further increased if the microglia are \"primed\" by exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN\u2425 or IL-1\u2423 (46): such exposure would be expected in an inflammatory lesion. The superoxide is produced largely extracellularly as part of the \"respiratory burst\" phenomenon common to macrophages, neutrophils etc, and mediated by the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (98, 196) , although other generators may also be involved (44). Cells capable of significant superoxide production via the respiratory burst can be recruited to lesions within the nervous system in inflammatory demyelinating diseases. Phagocytic cells are known to be closely associated with myelin sheaths in some such disorders and may act as a concentrated source of ROS.

Important mechanisms probably include the direct transaxolemmal entry of calcium ions as part of excitatory activity, and the release of calcium from intracellular pools. The calcium ions can activate phospholipase A2, leading to the release of arachidonic acid and the initiation of the cascade resulting in the formation of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes by cyclooxygenases and lipooxygenases. These enzymes utilise molecular oxygen, and can generate ROS as they function. It may be significant in this respect that axonal activity may be greater than normal in demyelinating diseases such as MS. The increase can result either from the development of sustained, spontaneous, repetitive discharges in demyelinated axons (122, 214, 212), or from the enhanced firing rates of spared axons presumed to occur in compensation for the function lost in axons blocked by demyelination (211) . Massed synchronous discharges have also been reported. Electrical activity, especially the massed activity which has occasionally been reported in demyelinating disease (212) , is also accompanied by a significant increase in extracellular potassium concentration. Elevated potassium levels may be predicted to be especially large in those MS lesions which have a reduced density of astrocytes (e.g. \"open\" lesions (9)), since these cells are believed to buffer the extracellular potassium concentration. The raised extracellular potassium concentration may raise ROS levels further since it has been found to increase superoxide production by cultured microglia activated by exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (45).",

These cells have not been shown to produce ROS as part of their normal function, but a modification of their mitochondria can result in superoxide production during the early stages of apoptosis (142, 260). Since these cells are not known to produce \u2022 NO it is interesting that CD4 + cells can show immunoreactivity for nitrotyrosine in EAE lesions (57). Nitrotryrosine is a marker for the former presence of peroxynitrite, and it is possible that this potent oxidising agent is formed by the combination of \u2022 NO diffusing from nearby cells reacting with superoxide produced by imminently apoptotic T cells (57).",

Evidence of ROS generation in the brains of patients has been derived either indirectly, from measurements of the products of lipid oxygenation during the course of the illness, or directly, after death. The indirect evidence has been partly conflicting. An early study found evidence of lipid peroxidation in the CSF of patients with MS, but not in the plasma (111), but a subsequent study found evidence in the serum, but not the CSF (158) see also (81). In the latter study (158) , no correlation was identified between levels of lipid peroxides and disease severity or time since relapse. However, as the authors pointed out, few of their patients had severe disability or a long relapse-free interval. The authors considered that elevated CSF levels of peroxidation products were absent either because there was no increase in CSF lipid peroxidation or, more likely, because CSF lipid peroxides were removed rapidly following their generation. Another study (35) found evidence of significantly higher concentrations of malondialdehyde in patient CSF, together with altered levels of enzymes involved in oxidative defence: the activity of glutathione reductase was significantly increased, whereas the activity of glutathione peroxidase was markedly decreased. In a recent study, lipid peroxidation in plasma and CSF samples were not detected above control levels in patients with MS or aseptic meningitis, but a significant increase was detected in plasma samples from patients with GBS (91). The authors drew a tentative correlation between this finding and the observation that plasma exchange can shorten the course of disease in GBS. Raised concentrations of the antioxidant protein haptoglobin were detected specifically in GBS, but no significant increase was detected in lipid peroxidation in the CSF of GBS patients (91). Evidence of lipid peroxidation was sought in another study by measuring the breath levels of pentane (derived from linoleic acid) and ethane (derived from linolenic acid) as markers (231) . Ethane levels were found to remain stable, but pentane rose significantly during acute exacerbations of MS. Excretion of pentane subsequently fell when patients entered clinical remission. However, it has subsequently been claimed that all measurements of breath pentane may be invalid due to technical artifacts (215) .",

High pressure liquid chromatography was used to demonstrate an increase in uric acid in MS plaques, with a corresponding decrease in glutathione (132). The levels of the lipid radical scavenger vitamin E (\u2423-tocopherol) were lowest in plaques and highest in distant white matter. Newcombe et al. (164) used immunocytochemical techniques to detect low density lipoprotein (LDL) and LDL modified by the lipid peroxidation products, malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal in early and actively demyelinating plaques. Both LDL, which may enter the CNS after blood brain barrier damage in the acute inflammatory lesion, and its oxidation product were found in foamy macrophages within lesions, and also in astrocytes. These findings point to lipid peroxidation as an early event in the evolution of the plaque. Further direct evidence of oxidative damage to lipids, and proteins, in MS lesions has recently been detected using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (134). Data were obtained with near microscopic resolution, and revealed that while normal areas of MS white matter had similar spectra to control white matter, spectra from within MS lesions indicated an increase in the C=O to CH 2 ratio, suggesting lipid oxidation. Other data were consistent with the oxidation of proteins (134). The brain tissue had been fixed in formalin, but control studies suggested that fixation itself did not affect the data obtained.",

Arachidonic acid can be converted to prostaglandins by the enzyme cyclooxygenase and also to isoprostanes by the non-enzymatic free radical-catalysed peroxidation of arachidonic acid (241) . The isoprostanes, particularly 8-epi-PGF 2\u2423 , are used as indicators of oxidative stress (64, 185). The production of these pro-inflammatory compounds may evoke further tissue damage. For example, it appears that prostaglandin E 2 can act in conjunction with \u2022 NO to disrupt the blood brain barrier (117). A role for oxidant species in barrier breakdown is supported by the observation that administration of a 21-aminosteroid antioxidant (one of a group of compounds known as \"lazaroids\") can attenuate barrier disruption induced by arachidonic acid (96). The prostaglandins are not necessarily damaging to tissues, however. Administration of a long-acting analogue of prostaglandin E 1 has been found to suppress EAE (182) . The details concerning the effects of ROS on the bloodbrain barrier are the subject of recent reviews (63, 147).",

Studies in 1986 found that the antioxidant enzymes SOD (4) and glutathione peroxidase (118) were lower in erythrocytes and haematogenous cells, respectively, of patients than neurological controls. In keeping with an altered redox state, it has been found that red cell glutathione peroxidase levels are depressed in MS, with similar reductions occurring in circulating lymphocytes and granulocytes (205) . Furthermore, stimulated monocytes from patients with MS were found to produce significantly more hydrogen peroxide and superoxide than monocytes from controls (73). The authors concluded that blood monocytes in MS patients are \"primed\" so that they produce more ROS than normal when exposed to inflammatory stimuli. A subsequent study (81) obtained similar results using whole blood. A finding that red blood cells in patients with MS displayed increased mechanical fragility has been attributed to free radical-mediated damage to lipids in the red cell membranes (37, 198) .",

The authors proposed that the hydrogen peroxide acted both alone, and through the generation of free radicals in a cascade of lipid peroxidation and demyelination. Examining rats with clinical signs of EAE, Ruuls and colleagues found that macrophages and microglial cells exhibited significantly higher spontaneous levels of ROS compared with controls (192) .

These studies followed observations by Griot and colleagues that the demyelination caused in dogs by infection with the canine distemper virus may be due to ROS released by brain macrophages (86, 87) . The culture of dog oligodendrocytes in the presence of ROS generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reaction (an experimental system to generate superoxide), revealed that the oligodendrocytes were killed at ROS concentrations which did not appear to affect astrocytes or brain macrophages (88). Similar findings were subsequently made with bovine oligodendrocytes, which could be completely protected from death by the inclusion in the medium of catalase, an enzyme which degrades hydrogen peroxide to water, but not by the inclusion of the antioxidants SOD, DMSO, vitamin E or glutathione (124). The implication that hydrogen peroxide was responsible for the damage was consistent with findings from other cultured cell types and was also implicated in the toxicity of oligodendrocytes, from adult rat brain, arising from exposure to the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine (165) . Catecholamine metabolism can generate ROS, including hydrogen peroxide, and it is significant that the catecholamine toxicity could be prevented by catalase, and reproduced by the addition of equimolar concentrations of exogenous hydrogen peroxide. However, the toxicity is not necessarily due to hydrogen peroxide directly, even though it is a mild oxidant, since the toxicity may rather be due to the formation of the highly toxic hydroxyl radical through the action on hydrogen peroxide of transition metals such as iron and copper (98): oligodendrocytes are particularly rich in iron (see below).",

The incubation also caused the marked peroxidation of myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein, and this rendered the proteins susceptible to trypsin degradation (25).

The consequences of ischaemia are the subject of another review in this symposium, but it is appropriate to mention here the occurrence of primary demyelinating lesions induced in Mongolian gerbils by hyperoxia following transient brain ischaemia (150). This protocol is anticipated to encourage ROS formation, and it resulted in lesions in the corpus striatum, lateral thalamus, mesencephalon and internal capsule. Lesion formation correlated with the administration of 100% oxygen following the transient ischaemia. Delayed primary demyelinating lesions have also been produced in rats and gerbils with chronic hypoperfusion, indicating that mild hypoxia, combined with mild hypoglycemia, can preferentially affect oligodendrocytes (101, 239), reviewed in (120). Interestingly, carbon monoxide exposure results in vivo in an increased production of hydroxyl radicals (174) , and lipid peroxidation (229) , and some patients have been reported to show a delayed primary demyelination following carbon monoxide poisoning (78, 79).",

Adult rat oligodendrocytes are much more vulnerable to glutamate-induced cell death than astrocytes (succumbing to 200M glutamate, whereas astrocytes are resistant to 5mM (166) ). However, the extent to which oligodendrocytes are exposed to glutamate in demyelinating disease is uncertain. Examination of CSF from patients with MS has resulted in reports that glutamate concentrations can decrease (1, 2, 178) , remain unchanged (127), or increase (221) . The increased (221) concentration occurred in acute MS patients, and consisted of a doubling of glutamate concentration. Serum/plasma glutamate has more consistently been reported to increase in MS (178), especially during relapses (243) . In inflammatory MS lesions, glutamate concentrations might rise since astrocytic glutamate uptake is inhibited by the proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u2423, IFN\u2425 and IL-1\u2424, at least in vitro (255) . Glutamate is toxic to cultured oligodendrocytes through free radical attack consequent to the depletion of cystine, and thereby depletion of the antioxidant glutathione (166) . Glutathione depletion consequent to cystine deprivation also kills cultured oligodendrocytes (256) . In each case, the cultured oligodendrocytes could be protected by the addition of free radical scavengers, including vitamins C and E.",

A characteristic of established lesions in MS is the presence of demyelinated axons embedded among astroglial processes, with few, if any, oligodendrocytes. A factor contributing to this appearance may be the much greater resistance to ROS of astrocytes, in comparison with oligodendrocytes. It appears that several factors contribute to the comparative sensitivity of oligodendrocytes to ROS. For example, recent studies have revealed that cultured oligodendrocytes at several stages of differentiation (proliferative oligodendrocyte progenitor, proliferative oligodendroblast and mature oligodendrocyte) have less than half the glutathione content of astrocytes (121, 230). A low level of this important antioxidant is also apparent in vivo (210) , and appears to be due in part to a low rate of glutathione synthesis, and in part to their having only half the glutathione reductase activity of astrocytes, and a particularly low level (15% of astrocytic) of glutathione peroxidase activity (121). In addition, cultured oligodendrocytes fail to express Mn-SOD, even when exposed to ROS, in contrast to microglia and some cultured astrocytes (175) . Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies have revealed the absence of metallothionein in oligodendrocytes (159, 6), although appreciable quantities are present in astrocytes (15, 16, 160 ). Metallothionein is a protein particularly rich in cysteine (25-30%), making it an effec-tive antioxidant and binding agent for zinc and copper (70). Metallothionein is induced by cytokines, particularly IL-1 (123), and it is expressed at high concentration in reactive astrocytes in vivo (60, 163) . The absence of Mn-SOD and metallothionein in oligodendrocytes removes two more avenues of antioxidant defence from this cell.",

            "text": "A Role For Iron. The increased oxidative risk experienced by oligodendrocytes by virtue of their relative paucity of antioxidant defence is exacerbated by the fact that these cells contain most of the iron in the brain (48-50, 75). It is well known that reduced iron, probably in low molecular weight complexes such as iron-ADP and iron-citrate, can promote oxidative damage in vitro by catalysing the formation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide and causing secondary initiation of lipid peroxidation. Most of the iron in cells is in a \"safe\" form attached to the binding proteins transferrin and ferritin (48-50, 75), and in this form it is not available to catalyse free radical reactions. However, if this iron were to be released it could catalyse peroxidative chain reactions that could spread the effects of the injury over a wider area. It is notable in this regard that superoxide (and other reducing compounds such as vitamin C) can release iron ions from ferritin, and that hydrogen peroxide can release iron from haemoglobin (at high hydrogen peroxide:haemoglobin ratios (92)). Thus superoxide and hydrogen peroxide can create the conditions that lead to hydroxyl radical production, although the extent to which this occurs in vivo is not clear. In vitro, it has been demonstrated that activated microglia can release iron from ferritin, and that the release of iron is mediated through superoxide production by the microglia since it is blocked by SOD (257) . Interestingly, the oxidative stress experienced by cultured oligodendrocyte precursors when exposed to blue light (which excites compounds such as riboflavin ultimately resulting in increased hydrogen peroxide production) could be prevented either by chelating intracellular free iron, or by raising the concentration of intracellular glutathione to astrocytic levels (230) .",

Thus it has been found that the inclusion of a monolayer of neonatal rat astrocytes completely prevented the catecholamine toxicity described above (165) : astrocyte conditioned medium provided no protection. Also, neurons co-cultured with astrocytes have markedly elevated concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione when compared with neurons cultured alone (20, 194) .

This reduction is not due to scavenging of the superoxide, but rather to some other mechanism, which appears not to be mediated by guanylyl cyclase or cGMP. It has been noted that the reduction of superoxide generation may serve to limit the deleterious effects of excessive peroxynitrite forma-tion (126). This potentially beneficial effect of \u2022 NO is counterbalanced by the fact that \u2022 NO can decrease the activity of some of the enzymes involved in anti-oxidant defence in cultured oligodendrocyte-like cells. Thus, although exogenously or endogenously produced \u2022 NO increased the activity and protein level of Cu/Zn-SOD, it was found to decrease the activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, catalase and Mn-SOD, probably through the down regulation of the expression of their mRNAs (68). \u2022 NO may also inactivate glutathione peroxidase directly by modifying essential cysteine-like residues in the enzyme. Such observations indicate that \u2022 NO production may affect the level of oxidative stress and the effects of ROS production. If \u2022 NO reduces the antioxidant defence of oligodendrocytes in early inflammatory MS lesions, namely a location where the cells will be exposed to a range of ROS and RNS, it would provide additional explanation for the loss of these cells and the formation of a demyelinating lesion.",

It can, for example, react with organic radicals and it can stop chain radical reactions. Perhaps as a consequence of such reactions, several experiments have found that blocking \u2022 NO production in EAE is sometimes detrimental (see \"Antioxidant Therapy\" below). Indeed, \u2022 NO is known to exhibit some anti-inflammatory properties, such as decreasing the proliferation of lymphocytes in vitro (65), inhibiting the adherence of leukocytes to the vasculature and infiltration into the tissue (131), and decreasing IFN\u2425 production by Th1 T lymphocytes (228) . Other protective effects of \u2022 NO include protection from superoxide-or hydrogen peroxide-mediated damage to cells in vitro, perhaps achieved by blocking the formation of hydroxyl radicals (247).

            "text": "Hartung et al. (100) found that early treatment of rats with the antioxidants catalase or SOD protected against actively-induced EAN, and that even if treatment was delayed until after the onset of neurological deficit (i.e. a clinically relevant regimen) the agents were still effective in markedly reducing the severity of disease. This important demonstration that ROS may be involved in peripheral autoimmune demyelinating disease was followed in 1992 by the observation that one of the 21aminosteroid antioxidants was effective in reducing the incidence and severity of actively-induced EAE in the CNS (95). The administration of catalase before the onset of neurological deficit was also found to delay the onset of EAE and to reduce its severity and duration (192) . Furthermore, another antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole, was effective in reducing the incidence, severity and mortality of passively-induced EAE (99). A synthetic catalytic scavenger of oxygen radicals, EUK-8, also ameliorated EAE in mice (141). This evidence for the involvement of ROS was accompanied in 1994 by the demonstration that RNS may also be involved. Several investigators have shown that aminoguanidine, a weak but preferential inhibitor of the inducible/inflammatory form of NOS, inhibits the expression of disease in mice and rats with actively-induced EAE (30, 58, 261) and inhibits demyelination induced by Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (189) . Also, the use of antisense knockdown of iNOS in mice has been shown to inhibit EAE (67). Additional data supporting a view that decreasing \u2022 NO concentrations may be of therapeutic value have been presented by Hooper et al. (105,  107) . These authors found that the inhibition of iNOS induction (using tricyclodecan-9-xyl-xanthogenate), or scavenging of \u2022 NO (using 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide) or peroxynitrite (using uric acid), inhibited neurological disease in mice with actively-induced EAE. Withdrawal of the iNOS inhibitor resulted in the expression of neurological signs within 24 hours.",

            "text": "The evidence described above provides a seemingly unambiguous argument for the value of antioxidant therapy in inflammatory demyelinating disease. However, data reported in 1995/6 (193, 262) suggested that the inhibition of nitric oxide production is not always beneficial, and the most recent data (54) indicates that such inhibition can be lethal. Zielasek and colleagues (262) used several inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, namely NG-L-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA), which is relatively non-specific for different NOS isozymes, aminoguanidine, which is relatively selective for the inducible form of NOS, and two other inhibitors. They examined the effects of these inhibitors in different models of experimental autoimmune disease. L-NMMA partially suppressed passively-induced EAN (i.e. EAN induced by the injection of neuritogenic T-cells), but not actively-induced EAN or passively-induced EAE. Aminoguanidine enhanced actively-induced EAE, and had no significant effects on actively-induced EAN. The other NOS inhibitors had little or no effects in EAN and EAE. As the authors noted, the diversity of action indicates that the \u2022 NO pathway may play a more complex role in disease than previously suggested. Ruuls et al. (193) found that the NOS inhibitors N(omega)-nitro-Larginine and N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine, exacerbated actively-induced EAE. Another study (54) also found that NOS inhibition, by aminoguanidine, exacerbated actively-induced EAE. Other recent data has revealed that iNOS knockout mice have more severe EAE (72, 195) . Indeed, the complexity was highlighted further by the observation that another NOS inhibitor, N-methy-Larginine (NMA), could induce disease in PVG rats which are normally resistant to actively-induced EAE (54). The disease in PVG rats was fulminating in nature, and accompanied by some mortality. Interestingly, in the absence of NOS inhibition, PVG rats were found to develop higher serum nitrite and nitrate levels (surrogate markers of \u2022 NO production) than did Lewis rats, even though Lewis rats are susceptible to EAE. This data suggested that \u2022 NO may actually protect PVG rats from disease, and additional in vitro data indicate that this protection may be due to the inhibition by \u2022 NO of T cell proliferation (54).",

However, therapy with IFN\u2424 has been shown to reduce the relapse rate and possibly clinical progression (97, 191) . It is often proposed that IFN\u2424 produces its beneficial effects by mechanisms involving immune modulation. However, it has recently been realised that IFN\u2424 also impairs the ability of astrocytes in vitro to form iNOS in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as exposure to the cytokines IL-1\u2424 and IFN\u2425 (90, 109, 218, 219 ). IFN\u2424 also downregulates the level of steady state expression of iNOS in cultured astrocytes (109). These observations raise the possibility that, in part at least, IFN\u2424 may effectively be functioning in MS as a component of the antioxidant defence. If so, then other therapies based on this strategy may also be beneficial. The role of nitric oxide in MS has been examined in a recent review (171) .",

            "text": "The variable observations obtained with the use of NOS inhibitors in experimental autoimmune demyelinating disease may be related to the relative lack of potency and specificity of the inhibitors, or to inopportune timing of the therapy in the course of the disease: \u2022 NO has immune regulatory effects as well as cytotoxic ones (see above), and so the timing of administration could be critical. Theory suggests that if \u2022 NO inhibition can be an effective therapy for MS, an ideal \u2022 NO inhibitor would be one which was specific for iNOS, since this would leave the eNOS and nNOS enzymes unaffected, permitting normal physiological function to continue. [However, it may be worth mentioning evidence that iNOS can be induced in response to noninflammatory, non-immunologic, or inapparent stimuli, and so even a specific inhibitor may have unwanted \"side\" effects (see discussion in (161)).] When such an inhibitor is discovered it will be interesting to consider whether it may best be employed in conjunction with neurotrophic therapy. Evidence has recently been advanced suggesting that at least one of the neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), limits its own neuroprotective potential by inducing NOS, and thereby damaging \u2022 NO production (128) see also (144) . The data showed that whereas neither BDNF nor a free radical inhibitor (either the spin trap S-PBN or the NOS inhibitor L-NAME) effected significant survival of retinal ganglion cells from axotomy-induced death, the agents acted synergistically upon co-administration to rescue significant numbers of RGCs.",

It has been reported (4) that exposure of MS patients to hyperbaric oxygen resulted in a significant increase in erythrocyte SOD levels, indicating an increase in cellular oxidative defence. It seems likely that the exposure to hyperbaric oxygen resulted in an increase in superoxide, and that this induced the formation of oxidative stress enzymes. If such enzymes were also induced in CNS cells, it would increase the tolerance of the cells to oxidative stress and this could help to explain the beneficial effects in animals (242) .",

            "text": "It seems likely that peroxynitrite, or one of its derivatives, plays a role in the development of MS lesions, given the presence of nitrotyrosine labelling within lesions (56, 57, 235) . This view is supported by the efficacy of a trial therapy based on peroxynitrite scavenging using uric acid (105, 107) (although uric acid actually scavenges several reactive species, not just peroxynitrite). Since peroxynitrite is formed by the combination of superoxide and \u2022 NO, peroxynitrite formation can be diminished by inhibiting the production of either of these molecules: it is not necessary to inhibit both. Indeed, strategies aimed at reducing the formation of either molecule have produced beneficial effects in EAE (30, 58, 67, 95, 99, 100, 105, 107, 141, 192, 261) . It is too early to state with any certainty whether superoxide or \u2022 NO (if either) will form the best target for new therapies in human demyelinating disease. Current electrophysiological evidence from our laboratory shows that exposure to \u2022 NO donors can promote conduction block (183) and axonal degeneration (213) , and such observations appear to recommend therapeutic strategies based on decreasing the concentration of \u2022 NO. However, the effector molecule (whether \u2022 NO, peroxynitrite or another \u2022 NO derivative) in the electrophysiological experiments is not yet clear. Furthermore, therapies designed to decrease \u2022 NO concentrations (54, 72, 193, 195, 262) have been less consistently beneficial in experimental demyelinating disease than those designed to limit superoxide. This latter consideration favours the development of strategies to inhibit extracellular superoxide formation within lesions. Such strategies may also limit the formation of hydrogen peroxide, a molecule which appears to be quite toxic to oligodendrocytes (124, 165). The pace of research into the roles of ROS and RNS in demyelination is accelerating rapidly, and the optimal strategy may soon become clearer. ",
