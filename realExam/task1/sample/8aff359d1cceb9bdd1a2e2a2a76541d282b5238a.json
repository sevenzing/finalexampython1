Immunology research in non-traditional model organisms can be advantageous or even necessary (e.g. for host-pathogen interaction studies), but presents multiple challenges, many stemming from an incomplete understanding of potentially species-specific immune cell types, frequencies and phenotypes. Identifying and characterizing immune cells in such organisms is frequently limited by the availability of species-reactive immunophenotyping reagents for flow cytometry, and insufficient prior knowledge of cell type-defining markers. Here, we demonstrate the utility of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to characterize immune cells for which traditional experimental tools are limited. Specifically, we used scRNA-Seq to comprehensively define the cellular diversity of equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy horses across different breeds, ages, and sexes. We identified 30 cell type clusters partitioned into five major populations: Monocytes/Dendritic Cells, B cells, CD3 + PRF1 + lymphocytes, CD3 + PRF1lymphocytes, and Basophils. Comparative analyses revealed many cell populations analogous to human PBMC, including transcriptionally heterogeneous monocytes and distinct dendritic cell subsets (cDC1, cDC2, plasmacytoid DC).

Upon inspection of read mapping patterns for select genes known to be highly expressed in equine PBMC but found to be absent from our datasets, we frequently observed reads mapped immediately downstream of annotated transcript regions (Fig. S1B ). This pattern is consistent with effective sequencing of transcript 3' regions (as expected with 10X Chromium 3' scRNA-Seq) but omission from quantification due to transcriptome annotations. In particular, incomplete annotation of transcript 3' untranslated regions (UTRs, the most frequent transcript region captured by 10X Chromium 3' scRNA-Seq) (18) , is common in non-traditional model organisms relative to mouse or human reference transcriptomes (19) .

Within the B cell compartment, we expected to detect clusters consistent with na\u00efve B cells, memory B cells, and antibody secreting cells, based in part on human PBMC scRNA-Seq data and equine PBMC flow cytometry data (15) . In addition to these clusters, we were surprised to observe two additional clusters of apparent B cells (as defined by high expression of MS4A1/CD20 and immunoglobulin transcripts) with gene expression patterns notably distinct from presumptive na\u00efve and memory clusters. Cells in these clusters, characterized by specific expression (within the B cell major cell group) of the T-bet transcription factor (TBX21), were the most abundant B cells across all seven horses under investigation. Corresponding populations of T-bet + B cells were not observed in human PBMC scRNA-Seq data, and have not been previously described in horses. In mice, T-bet + B cells have been shown to be important for antiviral humoral immunity (34, 62, 63) . In humans, T-bet + B cells have been detected in peripheral blood in a variety of chronic inflammatory contexts including systemic lupus erythematosus (64, 65) , chronic malaria exposure (66, 67) , and chronic viral infection (16, 40, 68) .

In addition to TBX21/T-bet expression, horse T-bet + B cell populations exhibit similar gene expression patterns, including enriched expression of FCRL4, FGR, and HCK, the protein products of which modulate BCR signaling (38) . Furthermore, a recent study of T-bet + B cells in HIV demonstrated that they express genes characteristic of germinal center B cells (16) . Interestingly, we detected specific expression of AICDA (encoding activationinduced cytidine deaminase) and elevated expression of APEX1 in equine T-bet + B cells, suggesting that the T-bet + B cells identified here may represent equine equivalents of the T-bet + atypical memory B cells described in humans. If these cells are elicited by chronic antigenic stimulation, it is plausible that horses chronically exposed to numerous pathogens common in standard boarding conditions (e.g. equine alpha and gamma herpesviruses, influenza, rhinitis viruses, hepacivirus, parvovirus-hepatitis, coronavirus, etc.) could expand this population. While viral exposure burdens are likely to be largely similar to burdens experienced by humans, horses in the northeastern U.S. are also frequently exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi (agent of Lyme disease) (69) and Sarcocystis neurona (agent of Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis) (70) , and are continuously infested with or re-exposed to gastrointestinal nematodes (71) .

Cluster 25 was excluded from analysis due to low transcript (UMI) counts (Fig. S3A). Remarkably, we observed six B cell clusters with distinct transcriptional profiles represented across all seven horses (Fig. 3B); this heterogeneity was somewhat surprising given our observation of only three B cell clusters (annotated as na\u00efve, memory, and antibody secreting) in human PBMC scRNA-Seq data (Fig. S2A-B and additional datasets, data not shown). Hierarchical clustering on integrated PCA data suggested that clusters 27 and 30 were notably dissimilar from other B cell clusters, and based on recognizable gene expression patterns, we annotated cluster 27 as antibody secreting cells (ASCs, expressing PRDM1/BLIMP1, XBP1, IRF4, high levels of immunoglobulin transcripts) and cluster 30 as proliferating B cells (numerous G2/M associated genes including PCNA, TOP2A, and UBE2C) (Fig. 3C, D, E, Dataset S5). Of note, ASCs, which consistently exhibited high expression of a single immunoglobulin isotype per cell, demonstrated different isotype frequencies in different horses, perhaps indicative of distinct subclinical immune challenges (Fig. S3B). In reviewing the differentially expressed gene lists for the remaining B cell clusters, we noted the cluster-restricted expression of several transcription factors important for a variety of immune functions (Fig. 3E). Consistent with hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3C), these results further suggest that B cells in clusters 9 and 15 (expressing transcription factors ID3, HIF1A and MEF2C) employ a different gene regulatory program than B cells in clusters 0 and 22 (defined by specific expression of TBX21/T-bet, as well as elevated expression of POU2F2/Oct-2) (Fig. 3E). Given the fundamental relationship of immunoglobulin isotypes to B cell biology, we also explored the expression of immunoglobulin transcripts by different clusters. Using an updated immunoglobulin reference annotation (Dataset S6, adapted from (32), details in Materials and Methods), we observed different isotype transcript expression patterns in different B cell clusters (Fig. 3F). Importantly, and although we supplemented the transcriptome reference with these updated immunoglobulin transcript definitions during read mapping and quantification, all immunoglobulin genes were excluded from clustering to ensure clusters were not defined by isotype usage. Based on specific expression of IGHD transcripts and expression of IGHM transcripts, we annotated cluster 9 as na\u00efve B cells. Relatedly, we annotated cluster 15 as likely memory B cells based on an overall gene expression pattern relatively similar to na\u00efve B cells (cluster 9), but with the expression of class-switched isotype transcripts (IGHG1, IGHG3, IGHG5, IGHA), and the absence of IGHD transcripts. These cells are also defined by expression of ZBTB20, a transcription factor associated with antigen-experienced B cells (isotype-switched memory, germinal center, plasma cells) in mice (33), but they do not express plasma cell transcription factors such as PRDM1/Blimp-1 and XBP-1 at appreciable levels (Fig. 3E). The TBX21/T-bet + B cells in clusters 0 and 22 exhibited diverse isotype transcript expression patterns, which included both IGHM and class-switched isotypes (IGHG1, IGHG3, and IGHG6, most pronounced in cluster 22). With sequence data restricted to 3' transcript regions (i.e. without coverage of variable region/constant region exon-exon junction), it was not possible to infer how these RNA expression patterns relate to functional/productive immunoglobulin protein expression. We next performed cross-species hierarchical clustering on scRNA-Seq data for equine and human B cells (Fig. S2A-B). Consistent with our supervised annotations, equine cells annotated as na\u00efve B cells clustered with human na\u00efve B cells, equine cells annotated as memory B cells clustered with human memory B cells, and the equine cells annotated as antibody secreting clustered with the human ASCs (Fig. 3G). The equine T-bet + B cells (clusters 0 and 22) appeared on a distinct branch of the clustering dendrogram. These results support our annotation of equine na\u00efve and memory B cell populations, and suggest that the T-bet + B cell clusters, which include the most abundant B cell cluster in horse peripheral blood, do not have a corresponding B cell population in PBMC from healthy humans (N = 2).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "The remaining CD3 + PRF1 + clusters(17 and 4)  exhibited gene expression patterns consistent with both cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.

However, both clusters also displayed expression of genes associated with NK cell function, including FCGR3A/B (CD16, employed by NK cells for antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity), and ZNF683 (HOBIT, a transcription factor highly expressed by human NK cells (48) and used as a surrogate for equine NK cells by RT-PCR (49) (Fig. 5E);", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "). Populations defined by flow cytometry gating (Fig. S5) were matched to corresponding scRNA-Seq clusters (grouped as indicated,Fig. 7B). Of note, flow cytometry data was acquired from the same samples processed for scRNA-Seq, and the researcher (J.E.T.) performing gating and analyses was blinded to frequencies determined by scRNA-Seq. Overall, cell frequencies determined by scRNA-Seq were strongly correlated with frequencies determined by flow cytometry (r = 0.93 for indicated populations examined). We observed strong concordance in frequencies of CD4 + T cells, classical monocytes, and non-classical monocytes(Fig. 7B). We consistently measured higher frequencies of NK cells and B cells by scRNA-Seq, which suggests that current flow cytometry definitions (NK cells: CD3 + CD16 + ; B cells: Pan-Ig + ) based on available equine-reactive antibodies might not capture these cell populations entirely.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "allowed for effective resolution of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and B cells. Additional panels were developed for this study, which identified proliferating T cells, NK cells, CD14 + monocytes, CD16 + monocytes, and T-bet+ B cells. Using scRNA-Seq, we resolved 30 cell populations based on variable gene expression patterns. These populations could be partitioned into five major cell groups: Monocyte/DC, B cell, CD3 + PRF1 + lymphocytes, CD3 + PRF1lymphocytes, and Basophils. Combining supervised annotation based on prior knowledge and comparative cross-species clustering, we identified multiple distinct subpopulations with immunologically relevant gene expression patterns within these major cell groups. Many of these subpopulations have not been previously described in horse peripheral blood. Cross-species analyses demonstrated that many equine immune cell subpopulations have corresponding populations identifiable in humans. However, we also identified several immune cell populations (e.g. T-bet + B cells, discussed below) absent from healthy human peripheral blood. Overall, our study establishes a cellular atlas of equine PBMC in healthy horses, and demonstrates proof-of-concept for characterizing complex cell populations in non-traditional model organisms. The mononuclear phagocyte system is comprised of diverse cell types that carry out many different functions in innate and adaptive immune responses. Our analysis of the monocyte/DC major cell group revealed cellular heterogeneity and subpopulations consistent with other species, as well as subpopulation-specific gene expression programs with functional implications for the equine immune system.

Previous studies of equine DCs have relied on monocyte-derived DCs in vitro(58)(59)(60). Recently, Ziegler et al. identified DCs in equine peripheral blood based on FLT3L binding as detected by flow cytometry(61). Guided by marker expression in other species, they proposed defining three putative DC subsets as cDC1(Flt3 + CD4 \u2212 CD13 + CD14 low CD172a \u2212 CADM-1 + MHCII high ), cDC2 (Flt3 + CD4 \u2212 CD13 \u2212 CD14 low CD172a + CADM-1 low MHCII high ), and pDC (Flt3 + CD4 \u2212 CD13 \u2212 CD14 \u2212 CD172a \u2212 CADM-1 \u2212 MHCII low ).With the exception of CD13 (ANPEP, not detected in our scRNA-Seq data), RNA transcript expression for these surface markers in DC clusters identified in our study was entirely consistent with these definitions. Our transcriptomic data not only provide additional support for these immunophenotyping markers, but also define these subsets by gene expression patterncharacteristic of their functions. These include distinguishing transcription factor profiles of cDCs (high IRF8 in cDC1, low IRF8 in cDC2, SPI1/PU.1 expression in both cDC1 and cDC2), elevated expression antigen presentation machinery in cDCs (CD74, DRA, DRB, others), and steady-state expression of genes important for virus recognition and interferon response in pDC (TLR7, IRF7, IFNAR1", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "important functions in the sustained immune responses to such pathogens.
