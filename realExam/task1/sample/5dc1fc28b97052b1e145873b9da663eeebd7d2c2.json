In this study, we aimed at analyzing the viral epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ARTI in hospitalized children admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Methods: Cohort of 386 hospitalized children (31 days to 15 years) diagnosed with ARTI admitted to the Department of Pediatrics from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum samples on the day of hospitalization were tested for 11 viruses via a GeXP-based multiplex-PCR assay. The viral profiles and clinical characteristics were analyzed. Results: The overall positive rate of the samples was 43.26% (167/386). Among the 167 positive samples, 134 (80.24%, 134/167) had a single virus and 33 (19.76%, 33/167) had multiple viruses.

It should be noted that multiplex-PCR technology can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens at the same time, which is also easy-to-operate and need less workforce. 7 It is well known that ARTI prevalence in children may vary in different geographic regions and different seasons. 4, 8 However, information regarding viral ARTI in pediatric hospitalized children in Fuzhou city (central Fujian) is still limited.

Viral infections were more likely to occur in winter-spring months than in the summer-autumn months (52.51% vs 33.53%, \u03c7 2 = 13.830, P = .000). It should be noted that HADV occurred more frequently in summer. HRSV was detected almost throughout the year. Other viruses occurred almost sporadically throughout the year without obvious seasonal trends. Currently, nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) (such as PCR and multiplex PCR) have been increasingly used for identification of pathogens in infectious respiratory diseases 7 ; and one of the multiplex-PCR technology, GenomeLab gene expression profiler genetic analysis system (GeXP)-based assay (developed by Beckman Coulter), has been adopted in the infectious pathogens diagnostics [10] [11] [12] ; this detection technique has been applied in clinical for over 5 years; however, more clinical application studies are still necessary, especially in southeast China. GenomeLab gene expression profiler genetic analysis system is a high-sensitive and specific analytical platform for high-throughput nucleic acid detection based on capillary electrophoresis separation technology, multiple gene analysis technology, and high-sensitivity laser-induced fluorescence technology. 10 The GeXP-based multiplex-PCR assay can easily detect and analyze up to 30 genes simultaneously in a single analysis by converting amplification with multiple primers to amplification with a pair of universal primers. 10 In this study, we used GeXP-based multiplex-PCR assay to detect 11 kinds of virus, as well as mycoplasma pneumonia and chlamydia pneumoniae in 386 samples from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection over a period of 1 year. It was a rapid, accurate, and high-throughput analytical method which can finish the detection process within 4 hours and may aid the pediatricians for early medical decision-making.",

With the application of this multiplex-PCR assay, the detection of multiple co-infecting viruses had become common which reflected the high sensitivity of this multiplex-PCR assay. Kouni S described that the prevalence of viral co-infections ranged between 15% and 44% in children seen in the hospital or emergency department. 13 In the present study, the detection rate of In our study, gender had no influence on the detection rate of respiratory viruses, which was consistent with other reports. 8, 14, 15 Many studies documented that respiratory viral infection was characterized by seasonal distributions, with their peaks lasting from winter to early spring. 15, 16 In the present study, the detection rate of respiratory viruses was also higher in winter and spring.

However, in the study of Li et al, though no significant differences in the positivity rate of the different age groups were observed, the prevalence of viruses was different between different age groups. This differences in the prevalence of viruses in different age groups observed between our and Li's study may be due to the following:first, the relatively small sample sizes of our study; and second, the differences in the sensitivity of these two analytical assays (GeXP and FilmArray) used in the studies.Influenza occurs all over the world, with an annual global attack rate estimated at 5%-10% in adults and 20%-30% in children.17 Influenza virus infection (IFVI) can cause primary viral pneumonia, which may progress to a potentially fatal outcome. It is documented that influenza causes significant morbidity in young children and, each year, leads to hospitalization of approximately 870 000 children under 5 years of age worldwide. 18,19 Influenza outbreaks usually occur during the winter and spring seasons, and in our study, influenza viruses (IFVA + IFVB+IFVA-H1N1 + IFVA-H3N2) (51/386, 13.21%) were the second most frequently detected viruses with remarkable seasonal distributions in winter and spring months.",
