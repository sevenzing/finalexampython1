The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is a small, enveloped, RNA virus classified within the Arteriviridae family (Cavanagh, 1997) . The viral genome consists of 15 kb long, linear, polyadenylated RNA that encodes nine open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1a and 1b encode proteins with replicase and polymerase activities, while ORFs 2-7 encode virusassociated proteins, of which the glycosylated protein GP5, encoded by ORF 5, is a major component of the virus envelope (Meulenberg et al., 1995) . GP5 is associated with the development of neutralising antibodies and host protection (Gonin et al., 1999; Meulenberg, 2000; Ostrowski et al., 2002; Plagemann, 2004a,b) and has been a key target in the design of novel vaccines that overcome safety problems associated with modified live vaccines Mengeling et al., 1999) and the limited efficacy of inactivated vaccines (Nielsen et al., 1997; Prieto et al., 1997; Scortti et al., 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 380, "text": "(Rossow, 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 500, "end": 516, "text": "(Cavanagh, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 854, "end": 879, "text": "(Meulenberg et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 968, "end": 988, "text": "(Gonin et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 989, "end": 1006, "text": "Meulenberg, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1030, "text": "Ostrowski et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1050, "text": "Plagemann, 2004a,b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1201, "text": "Mengeling et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1273, "text": "(Nielsen et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1294, "text": "Prieto et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1295, "end": 1316, "text": "Scortti et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Experimental vaccines that express native or modified GP5, either alone or in combination with protein M, have been devel-oped, including DNA vaccines (Pirzadeh and Dea, 1998; Kwang et al., 1999; Barfoed et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2006) , bacterial vaccines such as Mycobacterium bovis BCG or E. coli that express recombinant proteins (Pirzadeh and Dea, 1998; Bastos et al., 2004) , recombinant viral vaccines such as baculovirus (Plana-Dur\u00e1n et al., 1997) , pseudorabies virus (Qiu et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2007b) and adenovirus (Gagnon et al., 2003; Kheyar et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2007a) , and, more recently, replicon-based vaccines (Mogler et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009) .
