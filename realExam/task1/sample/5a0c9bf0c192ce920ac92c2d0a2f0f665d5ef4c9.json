Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases.",

We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. , the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3\u00b71 million individuals across 1\u00b73 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28\u00b78% (95% CI 28\u00b75-29\u00b71) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3-12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15\u00b70% (14\u00b78-15\u00b72) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15\u00b70% case reduction from school closings and 2\u00b70% baseline mortality rate, a 15\u00b70% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17\u00b76% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2\u00b700% to 2\u00b735% when the health-care workforce declines by 15\u00b70%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent.",

School closures are some of the highest-profile social (physical) distancing measures used to slow the spread of an infectious disease. Many countries in Asia and Europe have instituted a nationwide school closure, while US school districts and states have also closed schools. These closures prevent contact among children and reduce cases. However, closing schools has down sides, even if the only goal of the measure is to save lives during an epidemic. Closing schools can inadvertently cause childcare shortages that strain the health-care system. A study by Lempel and colleagues 1 estimated that child-care obligations associated with school closures could reduce key medical personnel by 6-19% .

Indeed, the entire idea of flattening the curve is to protect health-care capacity to reduce mortality, which might not be proportional to cases. How the curve is flattened also influences health-care capacity. The benefit of closing schools during an epidemic is to reduce transmission and new cases. A study by Cauchemez and colleagues estimated that extended school closures in France could reduce cases of H5N1 influenza by 13-17% (although in practice, some schools might stay open to provide child care, reducing this estimate). 2 Another study showed that schools are probable places for transmission on the basis of contact patterns of flu-like pathogens among US children. 3 However, that study also showed that voluntary behavioural changes, without mandatory shutdowns, appeared to reduce cases of the 2009 H1N1 influenza by 10-13%. 3 A systematic review focused on influenza and school closures found some evidence that school closures are effective, but the empirical evidence did not resolve how or when to close schools. 4 Additionally, the authors found that school closure mostly reduced infection in schoolchildren. Another systematic review did not find strong evidence that school closures prevented the spread of hand, foot, and mouth disease in Asia. 5 An economic assessment found that, although school closures did reduce incidence of diseases in France, the economic costs were large. The benefits of school closures are often estimated relative to a baseline of no voluntary changes in behaviour, but it is likely that the correct baseline for forecasting the effects of school closures on reducing the spread and mortality of COVID-19 includes other voluntary behavioural changes.",

If \u03ba is sufficiently large, then any percent increase in the mortality rate will be lower than \u03ba, and closing schools saves lives. This is the case when school closures lead to many avoided cases and few health-care workforce effects. Conversely, if \u03ba is near 0, then any percent increase in mortality will most likely exceed \u03ba, and school closure increases the cumulative mortality. This is the case if school closures reduce the labour force substantially while providing a relatively small reduction in cumulative cases. However, there is a band where 0 << \u03ba << \u221e , where whether closing schools can save lives or not and depends on the value of \u03b2, which is unknown.",

We estimate that the greatest shares of the health-care labour force with child-care obligations were in Utah (35\u00b74%, 95% CI 32\u00b79-37\u00b79), Louisiana (35\u00b70%, 33\u00b71-36\u00b78), and Missouri (34\u00b70%, 31\u00b75-36\u00b75; appendix). By contrast, the health-care labour force in Washington, DC, (16\u00b71%, 13\u00b78-18\u00b73), Vermont (21\u00b79%, 19\u00b78-24\u00b71), and Massachusetts (24\u00b73%, 22\u00b77-25\u00b79) had the lowest shares of child-care obligations. However, household structures can also vary from state to state. If child-care obligations can be met by a non-working adult or older sibling, then South Dakota (21\u00b72%, 19\u00b71-23\u00b73), Oregon (20\u00b77%, 18\u00b77-22\u00b78), and Missouri (20\u00b76%, 18\u00b74-22\u00b78) are the most exposed states to health-care worker shortages induced by school closures. Washington, DC (8\u00b78%, 7\u00b71-10\u00b75), New Mexico (10\u00b70%, 8\u00b76-11\u00b75), and New Jersey (11\u00b72%, 9\u00b77-12\u00b76) might have health-care workers most able to cover their child-care obligations. Louisiana (12\u00b70%, 10\u00b77-13\u00b73), Mississippi (11\u00b73%, 9\u00b79-12\u00b77), and Pennsylvania (10\u00b70%, 8\u00b79-11\u00b71) have the greatest fraction of health-care workers who are single parents. These differences are likely due to an interaction of variations in health-care regulation, cultural, and demographic differences at the state level. These differences require state and local health officials to consider the exposure of their own state or region (related data is available online). We combined the estimate of potential reductions in the health-care labour force during a school closure with projections of the case reductions from school closures to identify the conditions where the estimate of \u03ba is important to inform whether school closures would reduce net mortality (figure 2). For the USA, and for most states within the USA, \u03ba was not sufficiently high or low to estimate which way a school closure will turnout without more information on \u03b2. For example, using Cauchemez and colleagues' estimate 2 of a reduction in cases of 15% (range 13-17) from a school closure and assuming baseline mortality from COVID-19 of 2% (1\u00b75-2\u00b74), the \u03ba for this scenario is 0\u00b7176, with an associate \u03b2 crit =0\u00b7024. Therefore, the case mortality fraction after a school closure would need to rise to at least 2\u00b73% (1\u00b78-2\u00b78) as a result of the 15% loss in the health-care workforce to undo the case-reduction benefits of school closures. The percent increase in patient survival by avoiding a 15% reduction in the health workforce, an elasticity measuring health-care worker productivity, would necessarily need to exceed 0\u00b7024 for school closure to have an adverse effect. We forecast that doubling the health-care workforce must not reduce the case-fatality fraction by more than 2\u00b74% (1\u00b79-3\u00b70) or school closures could lead to more deaths (95% CIs by Monte Carlo simulation). However, substantial variation exists across the country. For example, in South Dakota, this elasticity was 0\u00b7017 (0\u00b7012-0\u00b7021), whereas in Washington DC it was 0\u00b7041 (0\u00b7029-0\u00b7054).",

The best available data do not provide a clear indication of which pathway will be dominant. On the one hand, our estimates of the proportion of health-care workers with child-care obligations might be optimistic because non-working adults might not be able to provide care or might require care themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that family members outside the household (eg, grandparents), neighbours, or friends could care for children, though no data are available in the CPS on these possibilities. Feng and colleagues 16 have cautioned that older people might become primary caregivers in this scenario, which puts this sensitive group at greater risk of infection. Critical level of the percent increase in mortality resulting from health-care workforce absenteeism associated with child-care obligations induced by school closures, \u03ba, that would offset the mortality reduction achieved by school closures through case reductions (colour scale). The actual percent increase in mortality must be lower than \u03ba to justify closing schools. The red point, \u03ba=0\u00b7176, indicates the best national estimate of cases avoided because of school closures (15%, 95% CI 13-17) and the mean estimate of unmet child-care obligations in the health-care workforce, 15%. This estimate accounted for the potential of other non-working adults or older siblings in the household to provide child care. COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019. What we know about distancing policies is based largely on models of influenza, 4, 17 in which children are a vulnerable group for morbidity. Anderson and colleagues 18 emphasised that children do not appear to be a sensitive group to COVID-19, and preliminary data on COVID-19 suggest that children are a small fraction of cases and might be less vulnerable than older adults. 19 If these early results hold up, then the already uncertain benefits of transmission reduction from school closures will be reduced compared with those from influenza. Conversely, school closures might be implemented earlier in COVID-19 outbreaks, which might lead to greater levels of prevented cases. Furthermore, school closures might lead to other adults staying home, which could also reduce cases. These are all important questions when considering school closures.",

Although some health-care occupations might be able to work remotely temporarily, the life-saving treatments that we focused on in this analysis generally require inperson care. We do not know how much a reduction in the health-care labour force, and in what occupations within that labour force, decreases the probability of survival for patients with COVID-19. However, we estimated that the segment of the health-care workforce most responsible for infection control in nursing homes is likely to be among the most highly affected by childcare obligations induced by school closures. Given our reasonable estimates of case reductions from school closures, a measure of the increased mortality risk of patients with COVID-19 from health-care absenteeism to care for children is a crucial, and to date, unknown parameter. This analysis did not include non-COVID-19 mortality that could occur from other conditions if the US health-care work force is reduced, but the risk to these patients should also be considered when deciding about school closure. We also did not consider the impacts on other crucial industries arising from school closure and child-care demand. Finally, how a policy trade-off plays out in one place might be different than in another, even if two locations have a similar set of COVID-19 cases. That is, different places might have similar projected benefits or reduced cases from school closures, but different costs.",

However, policy makers and advisers need to understand that closing schools might have serious unintended downstream effects on the health-care system, and substantial uncertainty exists about the effectiveness of school closures for preventing infection beyond schoolchildren. The effect of reducing the health-care workforce on patient survival is an important unknown. Our estimates suggest that in the USA, the health-care system appears disproportionately exposed to labour shortages induced by school closures, and the segment of that system that provides infection control in nursing homes even more so. Such potential shortages in the health-care workforce should be a first-order con sideration when assessing the potential benefits and costs of school closures. Alternative child-care arrange ments should be part of the school closure plan, and these should also take into account that alternative child-care arrangements could somewhat partly undermine the case reduction from school closures by bringing some children together.",
