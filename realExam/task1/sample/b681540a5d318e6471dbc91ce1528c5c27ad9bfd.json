It was at once moving and disheartening to observe them struggling to cope with unbearable workloads in a system which was not prepared to support them. Faced with exhausting shifts and often without adequate personal protective equipment, health care workers have been unsurprisingly affected by high rates of infection and death. [6] Indeed, as shown by Nava and co-authors, 65% of the casualties among medical doctors occurred in the two aforementioned regions. [3] An obvious reason for Italy's inadequate outbreak response can be found in years of neglect for the public sector, increased private expenditure, and health care budget cuts by governments of all political affiliations. [7] Other major shortfalls stem, in our opinion, from the extreme regionalization of health care, which has led to fragmentation of the decision-making process, increased inequalities, and lack of national coordination. [8] For instance, COVID-19 testing policies vary widely in Italy, where some regions perform mass contact tracing and outreach activities, while others prioritize severely-sick patients. The role of general practitioners in outbreak response activities is also differing substantially across the country. This heterogeneity, coupled with ambiguous communication, has generated inefficiencies and confusion.",

[9] During the last years, this number has been progressively tapered due to budget necessities, ignoring repeated warning by experts, [10] and leading to complete unpreparedness to handle the burden of patients who required intensive support. Major differences between regions, even neighboring ones, in terms of respiratory equipment availability were obvious on everyday news. Nevertheless, inter-regional collaboration was limited. Most patient transfers to relieve overwhelmed intensive care units were indeed performed inside the same region, or towards foreign countries.",
