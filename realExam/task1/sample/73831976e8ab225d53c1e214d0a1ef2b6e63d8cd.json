Increased concentrations of ROS in the lungs of such patients are reflected by elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the breath, airways, lung tissue and blood. Traditionally, the measurement of these biomarkers has involved invasive procedures to procure the samples or to examine the affected compartments, to the patient's discomfort. Non-invasive approaches to measure oxidative stress have been investigated. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a noninvasive sampling method for real-time analysis and evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers in the lower respiratory tract airways. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as H 2 O 2 , F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, antioxidants, glutathione and nitrosative stress such as nitrate/nitrite and nitrosated species can be measured in EBC. Oxidative stress biomarkers also have been measured for various antioxidants in disease prognosis. EBC is currently used as a research and diagnostic tool in free radical research, yielding information on redox disturbance and the degree and type of inflammation in the lung.

Clinical risk scores such as pneumonia severity index (PSI) and CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age > 65 years), and blood biomarkers of different physiopathological pathways are used in predicting longterm survival in patients with CAP. In a prospective study, patients admitted with CAP were followed for 6 years and Cox regression models as well as area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were used to investigate associations between initial risk assessment and all-cause mortality (Alan et al. 2015) .

Serum levels of three cytokines were significantly elevated in SARS patients versus the CAP: Interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-6.

A further difference between groups was the ratio of IL-6 to IL-10, at 4.84 in SARS patients versus 2.95 in CAP patients. However, in both sets of patients, levels of IL-6 correlated strongly with the severity of lung injury. The early induction of IP-10 and IL-2, as well as the subsequent overproduction of IL-6 and lack of IL-10, probably contribute to the main immunopathological processes involved in SARS lung injury and may be early biomarkers of lung injury.

ET-1 levels were significantly higher in patients with unstable asthma than in the two groups with stable disease. Thus, measurements of ET-1 in EBC may provide another useful diagnostic tool for detecting and monitoring inflammation in patients with asthma. The release of ET-1 from bronchial epithelium through the influence of many inflammatory cells essential in asthma and interactions with other cytokines, may play an important role in increase of airway inflammation, which is observed after postexercise bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 325, "end": 349, "text": "(Zietkowski et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Endothelin-1 in Exhaled Breath as Biomarker of Asthma"}, {"text": "IgE plays a central role in the pathophysiology of asthma. The two essential phases in this pathophysiology are sensitization to allergen and clinical expression of symptoms on reexposure to the sensitizing allergen. Omalizumab (Xolair, Genentech) is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to circulating IgE, regardless of allergen specificity, forming small, biologically inert IgE-anti-IgE complexes without activating the complement cascade. An 89-99% reduction in free serum IgE (i.e., IgE not bound to omalizumab) occurs soon after the administration of omalizumab, and low levels persist throughout treatment with appropriate doses. A total serum IgE level should be measured in all patients who are being considered for treatment with omalizumab, because the dose of omalizumab is determined on the basis of the IgE level and body weight. The dose is based on the estimated amount of the drug that is required to reduce circulating free IgE levels to less than 10 IU per milliliter.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IgE as Guide to Dosing of Omalizumab for Asthma"}, {"text": "Lebrikizumab (Roche) is an injectable humanized MAb designed to block IL-13, which contributes to key features of asthma. Lebrikizumab improves lung function in adult asthma patients who are unable to control their disease on inhaled corticosteroids. IL-13 induces bronchial epithelial cells to secrete periostin, a matricellular protein. Increased levels of periostin, a biomarker of asthma, can be measured in the blood. In the MILLY phase II trial, patients with high pretreatment periostin levels had greater improvement in lung function when treated with lebrikizumab, compared to patients with low periostin levels (Corren et al. 2011) .The primary endpoint of the trial showed that at week 12, lebrikizumab-treated patients had a 5.5% greater increase in lung function from the baseline compared to placebo. Lebrikizumabtreated patients in the high-periostin subgroup experienced an 8.2% relative increase from baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared with placebo. In the low-periostin subgroup, those patients on the drug experienced a 1.6% relative increase in FEV1, compared with placebo.
