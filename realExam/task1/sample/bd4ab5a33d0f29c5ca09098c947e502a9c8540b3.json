We discuss AID biochemistry and how error-free forms of DNA repair are co-opted to prioritize mutagenesis over accuracy during antibody diversification.

In addition, the generation of a long-lasting antigen-specific antibody memory response is crucial to establishing immunity against pathogens, and AID plays a key role in this endeavor by engraving memories of past pathogen experience through genetic modifications of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Here, we review the most essential findings on AID since its discovery two decades ago by providing a timely update on the molecular mechanisms of AID in B cell antibody production.

The processes of SHM, gene conversion (GCV), and CSR further diversify this antibody repertoire upon B cell-cognate antigen interactions. In antigen-activated B cells, SHM introduces point mutations in the Ig variable (V) region of both Ig heavy (Igh) and light chains to enable the process of affinity maturation in the germinal center of secondary lymphoid organs. GCV is an alternative mechanism of altering antibody specificity and affinity in select vertebrate species, including rabbits and birds. GCV involves the production of singlestranded DNA breaks or double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) within the rearranged V(D)J region, triggering a homologous recombination-like process that repairs the lesion using IgV pseudogenes. This produces templated sequence alterations within the V-region. CSR is a Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 region-specific deletional recombination event whereby the exons encoding for the immunoglobulin IgM constant region within the Igh are replaced with a downstream constant region without changing the antigen-binding specificity, thereby altering the effector functions of the antibody. While all three processes are distinct genetic transactions, they share some common features, such as transcription of their target sequence [2] , and preferential mutation of RGYW/WRCY motifs (where W=A/T, R=A/G, Y=C/T), wherein the underlined G/C is mutated [3] . While not demonstrated until the discovery of AID, these and other specific similarities suggested a common inception to each of these processes.",

As this motif is preferentially mutated during SHM in vivo [12] , this result provides strong evidence supporting the DNA deamination model for AID function. Biochemical data suggest that AID is catalytically inefficient [13, 14] . The low catalytic rate has been proposed to act as an evolutionary safeguard to limit the mutagenic activity of AID [11]. Moreover, the accessibility of AID's catalytic pocket appears to be a key determinant of AID's catalytic rate [15] . AID has been suggested to act on single stranded DNA (ssDNA) by inducing multiple deaminations per binding event [10]. A single-molecule resolution F\u00f6rster resonance energy Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 transfer (FRET) study visualized the ssDNA scanning motion of AID, and suggested that the enzyme was able to move bidirectionally while remaining bound to the same ssDNA [16].

X-ray structure analysis with human monomeric AID reveals that AID prefers to bind and deaminate structured substrates, such as G-quadruplex (G4) structures that can form at the Switch (S)-region, over linear ssDNA substrates [18-20] (see Box 1). However, as such structures are rare, especially over diverse IgV exons, it is likely that other structures are also acted upon by AID, such as short patches of melted DNA [21] . These X-ray structure studies suggested that AID contains a bifurcated nucleic acid binding surface [15, 18] : one required for catalysis, and another positively charged surface in AID helix6, thought to play a role in recognizing structured substrates. A similar bifurcated nucleic acid binding surface has been identified in APOBEC3H, mediating dimerization [22]. Besides facilitating substrate binding, specific arginine residues in AID helix6 may underpin a licensing mechanism that links AID to transcription elongation and warrants productive targeting [23]. Nevertheless, biochemical, biophysical and structural approaches have provided valuable knowledge on AID targeting mechainsms during SHM and CSR (see below).

            "text": "Uracils introduced in DNA are normally repaired faithfully, restoring the original DNA sequence ( Figure 1 ). This is not the case during SHM, GCV or CSR, whereby the initiating AID-induced lesion promotes further mutagenesis that benefits affinity maturation by providing a widerange of amino acid changes, or causes DNA breaks that trigger recombination events. Why faithful repair of DNA uracils is subverted during SHM has been the subject of intense investigation. The majority of the uracils in the genome are faithfully repaired by the base Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 excision repair (BER) pathway: excision of uracils by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG); incision at the resulting abasic sites by apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1; processing of the abasic sites by DNA polymerase \u03b2, followed by sealing of the final nick by DNA ligase 3 [24]. Uracils escaping detection by UNG or single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1) can be copied over by the replication machinery, producing transition mutations at G:C base pairs (Figure 1) [25, 26]. However, during SHM, the later steps of BER are circumvented, for reasons that are not fully clear (see Outstanding Questions). Replication across the noninstructive abasic site by the translesional DNA polymerases REV1 and Pol \u03b7 generates both transition and transversion mutations at G:C pairs [27, 28] (Figure 1). Indeed, mice deficient in UNG (Ung -/-) exhibit reduced transversion mutations at G:C pairs in Ig V regions relative to wildtype (WT) mice, with a minor impact on mutagenesis at A:T base pairs [29]. Mismatch repair (MMR) also mediates repair of uracil lesions, detected as U:G mispairs. Replication-associated canonical MMR (cMMR) is traditionally a high-fidelity process that preserves genomic stability. cMMR begins with the recognition of a base mispair by the MutS\u03b1 heterodimer complex (MSH2/MSH6), followed by the recruitment of MutL\u03b1 complex (MLH1/PMS2) and the activation of the endonuclease activity of PMS2, and removal of a track of the DNA strand by exonuclease EXO1 [30, 31]. The resynthesis of the ssDNA gap by high fidelity replicative polymerases restores the original DNA sequences. Instead, during SHM, a subverted MMR pathway termed non-canonical MMR (ncMMR) using the translesion DNA Polymerase \uf068 is largely responsible for mutations at A:T base pairs [31-37] (Figure 1). Mutagenic ncMMR is largely linked to AID-lesions, as non-AID targets are faithfully repaired by MMR [38]. Recent work by a number of groups has shed light on ncMMR, whereby the UNG/SMUG1 and MMR pathways converge and work collaboratively to facilitate A:T and G:C mutagenesis [39-43]. This view is supported by findings that both UNG and ncMMR are able to function in the G1 phase of the cell cycle [41, 42], where AID activity peaks [44]. Hence, the introduction of an abasic site within the EXO1 excision track induces translesional repair and mutations at A:T base pairs. This can arise in a number of ways: EXO1 excises the wrong strand of an AID-induced G:U mismatch, thereby exposing dU on the ssDNA track to uracil excision by UNG or SMUG1. Alternatively, AID disrupts cMMR by deaminating a dC within the EXO1 Journal Pre-proof The NHEJ cascade The Ku70/80 complex, XRCC4, and Ligase 4 (Lig4) represent the \"core\" NHEJ factors based on their exclusive role in end joining. Upon AID-induced S-region DSB formation, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) sensor-kinase complex binds DSBs and recruits the ataxia telangiectasia-Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 mutated (ATM) kinase to the break site. ATM phosphorylates numerous substrates, leading to cell cycle arrest, as well as phosphorylating histone H2AX, which stimulates a cascade of events leading to the recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin flanking the DSB [50, 51]. 53BP1 promotes NHEJ and CSR by preventing DSB end resection [52] through the recruitment of Rif1 [53-56] and Shieldin, a protein complex composed of Shld1, Shld2, Shld3, and Rev7 [57-62] (Figure 2B). How the Shieldin complex prevents DNA end resection is still not clear, but it requires the binding of Shld2 to ssDNA exposed at DSBs [63] (see Outstanding Questions). After end processing, Lig4 and XRCC4 ligate the two DNA ends [64]. Alt-EJ DSBs generated during CSR are also repaired by the Alt-EJ pathway [47]. Factors that are implicated in Alt-EJ include CtIP [65, 66], which seems to have a role in end processing, XRCC1, ligase 1 and ligase 3, which are involved in end joining [67, 68]. HMCES (5-Hydroxymethylcytosine binding, ES-cell-specific) acts as an abasic site sensor in ssDNA [69], and also functions in the Alt-EJ pathway during CSR [70]. HMCES-defective mouse primary B cells and CH12F3 cells have shown reduced microhomology usage in switch junctions relative to WT cells [70]. This finding has been postulated to be mechanistically due to HMCES's ability to bind ssDNA overhangs, likely caused by strand resection of DSB at the S-regions, through its SOSresponse-associated-peptidase domain [71].",

SPT5 mediates the AID-RNAPII interaction and is sufficient to recruit AID to chromatin [23, 98] . The function of SPT5 is to initially cause promoter-proximal pausing of RNAPII [99] , and is thus enriched immediately downstream from the transcription start site (TSS). AID shows a similar genome-wide pattern by chromatin immunoprecipitations sequencing (ChIP-seq) in primary B cells, consistent with its accumulation at SPT5-rich sites (Box 2) [82, 98] . During transcription elongation, SPT5 remains associated with and acts as a positive factor for elongating RNAPII; thus, both accumulate inside gene bodies upon transcriptional stalling, a phenomenon considered key for AID activity [90, 98, 100, 101]. Accordingly, stalled RNAPII and SPT5 are found within gene bodies at the Ig V-and S-regions, as well as at some AID off-targets [72, 100, 102], which could recruit AID to stalled transcription [98, 100]. However, SPT5 is still abundant at the Ig constant regions and at many genes that are occupied by AID, but spared from mutation [80, 81, 88, 98] . Since AID is an inefficient enzyme in vitro, RNAPII stalling via SPT5 or RNA-DNA structures might not only expose ssDNA but also provide time for AID to work [15, 90] (see Figure 3C ). DNA-RNA R-loops or G4 DNA formed during transcription can stall RNAPII [103], and in fact, are preferred AID substrates in vitro [20] ; this might in turn contribute to AID susceptibility at certain loci. Another targeting mechanism has been proposed in which G4-RNA formed in the intron of the S-region transcript binds AID and brings it to the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 14 complementary DNA [104, 105] (Box 1). However, while R-loops and G4 can form in the Sregion and some AID off-targets such as Myc [19, 20, 89], their presence at the Ig V and at other AID off-targets, is unlikely and uncertain, respectively; therefore, other mechanisms must be at play for SHM [20] (Box 1). Transcriptional stalling may cause premature termination, another potential source of ssDNA demonstrated at the Ig V [101]. In addition, transcription-induced DNA supercoiling also provides ssDNA substrate to AID [106].",

Supporting the link between AID activity and transcription elongation, factors that interact with RNAPII after the pause release, namely SPT5, RNAPII-associated Factor (PAF) and the histone chaperones SPT6 and Faciliates chromatin transcription (FACT), are important for SHM and/or CSR, and biochemically co-purify with AID [72, 107, 108] . Whether histone chaperones facilitate AID activity at the Ig by their role in transcription or by defining histone modifications, is unclear. Of note, the RNA exosome has been linked to elongating RNAPII via SPT6 in Drosophila sp. cells [109] which may facilitate AID activity. A more precise understanding of how the transition from transcriptional pausing/stalling to elongation has an impact on AID activity is required. A speculative model integrating several observations would have AID accessing the gene body with elongating RNAPII, but only being able to mutate genes in which the transcriptional and genomic contexts cause simultaneous RNAPII stalling and ssDNA exposure (see Figure 3C and Outstanding Questions). In addition, the dissociation of AID from Ig loci to prevent mutation of constant regions must be somehow regulated --a step that has received little attention.",

            "text": "DSB formation in the Ig Switch (S)-region is a prerequisite for CSR. Ig S-regions are highly enriched with AGCT motifs, a palindromic variant of the WRCY motif ( Figure 2A ) [45] . Similar to SHM, the generation of DSBs during CSR also co-opts the activities of UNG and MMR, as Ung -/-Msh2 -/mice show abolished CSR relative to WT mice [46] . MMR-and UNG-induced nicks and gaps on opposite DNA strands are converted into DSBs in donor and acceptor S-regions, which are synapsed and ligated by DSB repair mechanisms, completing the CSR process. DSB repair during CSR primarily relies on canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which promotes DSB end joining with no or minimal sequence microhomology. Alternative end joining (Alt-EJ) plays a minor role in CSR and utilizes short regions of microhomology between both DNA ends to join DSBs [47] ( Figure 2B ). DSB repair by NHEJ involves limited DNA end processing, whereas increased resection and microhomology usage are two features of repair by Alt-EJ. As such, mechanisms that regulate DNA end resection promote usage of one DSB repair pathway over the other (see below). The structure of the AID-induced DSB has also been suggested to provide a decision of which DSB repair pathway to use [48, 49] . The stochastic activity of AID on both strands of DNA leads to a mixed spectrum of DSB structures in the S-region. Accordingly, staggered DSBs are the preferred substrates for Alt-EJ, whereas blunt DSBs are preferentially repaired by NHEJ pathway [49] . Indeed, CSR serves as an attractive physiological model for studying various DNA repair pathways at the same time, as all of BER, MMR, NHEJ, and Alt-EJ play key roles in DSB formation and repair.",

Third, AID can transiently and Biochemical fractionation indicates that ~50% of nuclear AID is associated to chromatin in mouse primary B cells and the CH12F3 B cell line [23, 83] . The phosphorylated form of AID at Ser38 (pS38), a Protein Kinase A substrate, is enriched in the chromatin-associated AID fraction [83] , which allows its interaction with the ssDNA-binding Replication Protein A (RPA), boosting CSR and SHM [84, 85] . Notably, pS38 seems dispensable for AID activity on Myc and increasing pS38 increases Igh-Myc translocations without affecting CSR [86] .

This convergent transcription can stall the RNAPII, causing early termination, and/or recruit RNA processing factors to favor AID activity by exposing ssDNA on both strands [72, 89] (Figure 3C ). In transcription-linked in vitro deamination assays, the transcript would normally protect the template strand from deamination, as the non-template strand is usually mutated. However, purified AID can mutate both strands of an Ig V region when transcribed in the presence of SPT4 and SPT5, a heterodimeric complex that regulates RNAPII processivity [90] . This suggests that AID has an intrinsic ability to mutate both strands under those conditions, but it is likely that in the more complex context of chromatin, some target genes require convergent transcription to expose both DNA strands to AID [88, 89].",

Although there is no evidence of a specific AID \"targeting factor\", the implication of ubiquitous transcription-associated factors, and the verification that several factors contribute to, but are not essential for SHM or CSR, suggests a multilayered AID targeting mechanism in which chromatin architecture, transcription quality, and AID regulation all contribute to define whether a locus is mutated or not, and to what extent. This is a fundamental mechanism to further understand, as it has direct implications in affinity maturation, and might eventually be [20] . One model envisages that co-transcriptional formation of DNA G4 on the non-template strand ssDNA stabilizes R-loops on the template strand, while processing of these R-loops by the RNA exosome exposes ssDNA and permits deamination of both strands [20] .",

However, the mechanism by which G4-RNA guides and hands off to the DNA is not clear. The unwinding of G4-RNA in S-region transcripts by the DEAD-box RNA helicase 1 (DDX1) to allow the formation of DNA:RNA R-loop hybrids at the Igh by base complementarity was recently proposed as a mechanism [105] . However, ablation of DDX1 reduced CSR only by 25% when analyzed per cell division, indicating that this mechanism is not essential for CSR.

Others reanalyzed the data and reported no AID-specific peaks [111] , which was rebutted, indicating that AID ChIP-seq requires specific analysis [112] . ChiP-seq peaks are defined by signal enrichment over background. The signal of AID ChIP is typically low, as only ~5% of the B cell AID is chromatin-associated according to biochemical fractionation [23, 83] . The background is primarly determined by the specificity of the antibody. The AID ChIP-seq study reported two experiments using different antibodies with similar results. They also used primary B cells from AID knockout mice as negative controls [23, 82] . Chromatin fragmentation by mechanical shearing can be a source of non-specific signals. Highly transcribed DNA regions are hypersensitive to sonication, resulting in an overrepresentation of these regions in the background. AID ChIP-seq revealed 5514 genes occupied in WT cells, of which 396 were shared with AID-deficient samples, and were also regions that were hypersensitive to sonication, (e.g.",

The identity of these relatively few genes can be biased by selection of mutations advantageous for the tumor cells and, accordingly, include many protooncogenes or tumor suppressors. Second, mid and high-throughput sequencing analyses have been undertaken in normal, activated or germinal center B cells, in mouse models. These efforts still sampled a small proportion of the genome, selecting genes based on defined criteria [79, 80] . These approaches have also revealed that some AID-deaminated genes are subsequently repaired by UNG-BER and/or MMR with high efficiency [79, 80] . Third, a series of studies have relied on methods that detect and/or trap AID-induced DSB [102, 113, 115]. These require off-target mutations to be converted to DSB, likely biasing the identification towards genes with the highest deamination load and/or displaying features that facilitate DSB. The latter could include high transcription and/or AID occupancy, enrichment in the WRCY motifs preferred by AID, the formation of secondary structures, or a combination thereof. For instance, G4 DNA may be preferred by AID and may amplify its activity by inducing AID",

This provocative observation was made in non-B cells (i.e. human fibrosarcoma line HT1080 and SV40-transformed fibroblast line GM639) overexpressing AID-GFP, so the pulses could not be correlated with SHM or CSR. Unlike AID pulses, AID nuclear import and entrapment during mitosis have both been confirmed in B cells by several groups[23, 44,[76][77][78] . Yet, it is unclear why a nuclear import mechanism for AID would evolve if passive trapping was sufficient to access the nucleus for SHM and CSR.While different AID fractions could conceivably access the nucleus by different pathways, this issue remains unknown, but certainly warrants further research.Associating to chromatin and transcriptionAID most preferentially mutates Ig genes but it also deaminates other genes (termed off-target genes) in normal B cells. In addition, the available data are consistent with AID occupying up to thousands of loci, of which just ~450 genes have been found mutated in normal B cells [23,79-  82]  (Boxes 2 and 3). These findings suggest the existence of AID susceptible and nonsusceptible loci[72]. If the occupancy of a locus by AID does not necessariy result in mutagenesis, what determines AID activity after it reaches chromatin?",

AID-induced uracil lesions can be repaired faithfully by canonical base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR), leading to no somatic hypermutation (SHM). Replicating over uracils by replicative polymerases generates transition mutations at G:C base pairs. UNG, and to a lesser extent, single-strandselective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), from the BER pathway, detect and excise uracils from DNA, creating abasic sites. Replicating over abasic sites by translesion synthesis polymerase from short-patch non-canonical BER pathway generates transition and transversion mutations at G:C base pairs. Non-canonical MMR pathway or long-patch BER can excise ssDNA surrounding either the dU:dG mismatch, or the abasic site, respectively, to initiate patch excision that leads to the engagement of translesion synthesis polymerases, generating both transition and transversion mutations at A:T base pairs.

            "text": "Multilayered productive AID targeting in B cells. (A) AID activity is restricted to type A chromatin compartments, which are accessible and transcriptionally active, versus transcriptionally inactive B compartments. (B) AID activity is also limited to some topologically associated domains (TADs) of DNA, often affecting highly transcribed genes regulated by superenhancers, with clusters by long-range interactions between regulatory sequences. The Ig and some off-target genes additionally harbor cis-acting elements named DIVAC (diversification activators) that attract AID activity. (C, D) AID can be recruited to promoter or promoterproximal paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) via SPT5. (C) AID accesses the gene body of susceptible loci through associations with the elongating RNAPII complex, via a putative licensing mechanism. At these loci, several mechanisms can provide single-strand DNA (ssDNA) AID substrates (yellow boxes): DNA supercoiling, DNA secondary structures, RNA processing of sense and antisense RNA. Transcriptional stalling, caused by nucleic acid secondary structures or by early termination due to antisense transcription, can also expose and favor AID jumping to ssDNA, possibly helped by the regulated association of AID to the ssDNA binding protein RPA. Stalling and SPT5 association may also allow time for AID to act on the small transcription bubble within the RNAPII. (D) At loci that are not susceptible to mutation, AID may fail its coupling with transcription elongation, and/or lack access to ssDNA substrates. NELF, negative elongation factor (causes RNAPII pausing); PAF, RNAPII-associated factor complex; Role of nucleic acid structures in targeting AID The transcriptional units encoding the different constant domains of Igh have revealed roles for RNA structures and RNA processing in CSR and AID targeting. These elements are transcribed from a cytokine-driven promoter, which produces a sterile transcript to allow AID access. The primary transcript contains a large intron encompassing the Switch (S)-region (1-12kb), made up of repeats rich in WRCY motifs. The G-rich composition of the S-regions enables the formation of secondary structures such as DNA-RNA hybrids producing R-loops and G4quadruplexes (G4) during transcription",
