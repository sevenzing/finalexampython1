In addition, changing climate and land use drive geographic range shifts 18 in wildlife, producing novel species assemblages and opportunities for viral sharing 19 between previously isolated species 4,5 . In some cases, this will inevitably facilitate 20 spillover into humans 6,7 -a possible mechanistic link between global environmental 21 change and emerging zoonotic disease 8 . Here, we map potential hotspots of viral 22 sharing, using a phylogeographic model of the mammal-virus network, and projec-23 tions of geographic range shifts for 3,870 mammal species under climate change and 24 land use scenarios for the year 2070. Shifting mammal species are predicted to ag-25 gregate at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human pop-26 ulation density in Asia and Africa, sharing novel viruses between 3,000 and 13,000 27 times. Counter to expectations, holding warming under 2\u00b0C within the century 28 does not reduce new viral sharing, due to greater range expansions-highlighting 29 the need to invest in surveillance even in a low-warming future. Most projected vi-30 ral sharing is driven by diverse hyperreservoirs (rodents and bats) and large-bodied 31 predators (carnivores). Because of their unique dispersal capacity, bats account for 32 the majority of novel viral sharing, and are likely to share viruses along evolutionary 33 pathways that could facilitate future emergence in humans. Our findings highlight 34 the urgent need to pair viral surveillance and discovery efforts with biodiversity 35 surveys tracking range shifts, especially in tropical countries that harbor the most 36 emerging zoonoses. 37 2 Main Text 38",

            "text": "68 Although several studies have mapped current hotspots of emerging diseases 3,26,27 , 69 few have modeled them in the context of global change. With the global reassortment 70 of animal biodiversity, it is unknown whether bats and rodents will still play a central 71 role in viral emergence 3,28 (ED Figure 1), or whether hotspots of viral emergence will 72 stay in tropical rainforests 27,29 which currently harbor most undiscovered viruses 3,30 . 73 Here, by projecting geographic range shifts and applying fundamental biological rules 74 3 for cross-species transmission, we predicted how and where global change could create 75 novel opportunities for viral sharing. We built species distribution models for 3,870 76 mammal species, and projected geographic range shifts based on four paired scenarios 77 of climate change (representative concentration pathways, RCPs) and land use change 78 (shared socioeconomic pathways, SSPs) by 2070. We treated dispersal potential as an 79 additional layer of biological realism, inferring these limits for species based on allomet-80 ric scaling 31 , and compared predictions with and without dispersal constraints. We used 81 these projections to identify where novel range overlap among unfamiliar species (\"first 82 encounters\") could happen, and used a recently-developed model to predict the proba-83 bility of viral sharing based on geographic overlap and host phylogenetic similarity 17 . 84 (ED Figure 2) This model framework allows powerful inference based on the \u223c1% of 85 the global mammalian virome that has been described 1,3,17 . Using this approach, we 86 tested the hypothesis that environmental change should drive biotic homogenization of 87 mammal communities, exposing mammals to novel viruses, and altering the structure of 88 mammal-virus interactions. 89 Most mammals are projected to undergo rapid range shifts in the next half century 10 . 90 If range shifts can keep pace with the velocity of climate change 32 , we predict that the 91 vast majority of mammal species (89%-98%) will overlap with at least one unfamiliar 92 species somewhere in their future range, regardless of emissions scenario. At the global 93 level, community turnover would permit almost 300,000 novel species interactions (ED 94 Figure 3). These \"first encounters\" between mammal species will occur everywhere in the 95 world, but are concentrated in tropical Africa and southeast Asia (ED Figure 4). This 96 result was surprising, and counter to our expectation that species might aggregate at 97 higher latitudes, given that most research has focused on poleward range shifts 33,34,35 , 98 and previous work has anticipated a link between climate change, range shifts, and 99 parasite host-switching in the Arctic 36,37 . However, our findings show that communities 100 tend to shift along latitudinal gradients together, with species rarely encountering new 101 conspecifics 38 . In contrast, species will track thermal optima along elevational gradents 102 and aggregate in novel combinations in mountain ranges, especially in tropical areas with 103 the highest baseline diversity, matching prior predictions 39 .",

Assuming that spillover will 108 be localized to areas of novel host overlap, we mapped expected viral sharing events, and 109 found again that most sharing should occur in high-elevation, species-rich ecosystems 110 in Africa and Asia ( Figure 1A ).

We limited the dispersal potential of flightless species further to the 118 restrictions placed on the SDM projections, based on an established allometric scaling 119 with body size, trophic rank, and generation time 42 . Dispersal limits caused significant 120 reductions in range expansions across all scenarios, especially warmer ones, and therefore 121 drove a reduction in novel interactions. Even in RCP 2.6 (the mildest scenario), limiting 122 dispersal reduced the number of first encounters by 60%, and reduced the associated viral 123 sharing events by 69%-to a still-staggering 3,600-3,800 projected viral sharing events. 124 Because trophic position and body size determine dispersal capacity, carnivores account 125 for a disproportionate number of first encounters, while ungulates and rodents have 126 slightly fewer first encounters than expected at random (ED Figure 6) Spatial patterns 127 also changed dramatically when dispersal constraints were added, with the majority of 128 first encounters and cross-species viral transmission events occurring in southeast Asia 129 (Figure 1B, ED Figures 4, 5). This viral sharing hotspot is driven disproportionately 130 by bats, because their dispersal was left unconstrained; we made this choice given their 131 exclusion from the original study 31 , genetic evidence that flight allows bats-and their 132 viruses-to circulate at continental levels 43,44 , and data suggesting that bat distributions 133 are already undergoing disproportionately rapid shifts 45 .

We found that a staggering 144 number of studies have also identified ongoing rapid range expansions in bat species 145 around the world 45,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 , with little mention in the broader climate change 146 or emerging disease literature. If flight does allow bats to undergo more rapid range 147 shifts than other mammals, we expect they should drive the majority of novel cross-148 species viral transmission, and likely bring zoonotic viruses into new regions. This could 149 add an important new dimension to ongoing debate about whether bats are \"special\" 150 5 due to their higher viral richness, higher proportion of zoonotic viruses, and potentially 151 unique immune adaptations 3,56,57,58,59 . 152 More broadly, climate-driven changes in the mammalian virome are likely to cascade 153 in future emergence of zoonotic viruses. Among the tens of thousands of expected viral 154 host jumps, some of the highest-risk zoonoses or potential zoonoses are likely to find 155 new hosts. This may pose a threat to human health down the road: the same general 156 rules for cross-species transmission explain spillover patterns for emerging zoonoses 60,61 , 157 and the viral species that make successful jumps across wildlife species have the highest 158 propensity for zoonotic emergence 3,7,28 . Just as simian immunodeficiency virus emer-159 gence in chimpanzees and gorillas facilitated the origin of HIV, or SARS-CoV spillover 160 into civets allowed a bat virus to reach humans, these wildlife-to-wildlife host jumps may 161 be evolutionary stepping stones for the \u223c10,000 to 600,000 potentially zoonotic viruses 162 346",

These species were ex-349 cluded. Aquatic species were removed using a two-filter approach, by cross-referencing 350 with Pantheria 83 . These results were verified by checking no species only had marine 351 habitat use types (see 'Habitat range and land use').

(For 378 example, in the vast majority of integrative assessment models, decarbonization cannot 379 450 macroecological patterns of viral sharing. 451 In the original study, a Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) was used to 452 predict virus sharing as a binary variable, based on (1) geographic range overlap; (2) phy-453 logenetic similarity; and (3) species identity as a multi-membership random effect. The 454 phylogeographic explanatory variables were obtained from two broadly available, low-455 resolution data sources: pairwise phylogenetic similarity was derived from a mammalian 456 supertree previously modified for host-pathogen studies 82,3 , with similarity defined as 457 the inverse of the cumulative branch length between two species, scaled to between 0 458 and 1. Geographic overlap was defined as the area of overlap between two species' IUCN 459 range maps, divided by their cumulative range size 94 . 460 We first retrained the GAMMs from 17 on the pairwise overlap matrix of species distri-461 bution models generated for this study, so that present predictions would be comparable 462 with future distributions. Of the 3,139 species in our reduced dataset, 544 had viral 463 records in our viral sharing dataset and shared with at least one other mammal, and 464 were used to retrain the GAMM from 17 . To check the performance of the GAMM, we 465 predicted sharing patterns with a) only random effects, b) only fixed effects, and c) with 466 both. Although species-level random effects had a mean effect of \u223c 0, excluding them en-467 tirely resulted in a substantial underestimation of the mean viral sharing rates across the 468 network (mean sharing \u2248 0.02 compared to \u2248 0.06). Therefore to ensure that the model 469 recapitulated traits of the observed network, we simulated 1,000 binary sharing networks 470 when predicting with only fixed effects, randomly drawing species-level random effects 471 in each iteration. The mean sharing value across these iterations closely approximated 472 observed sharing probability (\u223c 0.06). 473 Model validation and limits 474 Compared to the current viral sharing matrix, the model performs well with only fixed 475 effects (AUC = 0.80) and extremely well with both fixed and random effects (AUC = 476 0.93). The model explained a very similar proportion of the deviance in viral sharing to 477 that in Albery et al. 17 (44.5% and 44.8% respectively). 478 In practice, several unpredictable but confounding factors could affect the reliability 479 of this model as a forecasting tool, including temperature sensitivity of viral evolution in 480 host jumps 68 , or increased susceptibility of animals with poorer health in lower-quality 481 habitat or unfavorable climates. Moreover, once viruses can produce an infection, their 482 ability to transmit within a new species is an evolutionary race between mutation and 483 recombination rates in viral genomes, host innate and adaptive immunity, virulence-484 related mortality, and legacy constraints of coevolution with prior hosts and vectors 60,61 . 485 15 But data cataloging these precise factors are hardly comprehensive for the hundreds of 486 zoonotic viruses, let alone for the thousands of undescribed viruses in wildlife. Moreover, 487 horizontal transmission is not necessary for spillover potential to be considered significant; 488 for example, viruses like rabies or West Nile virus are not transmitted within human 489 populations but humans are still noteworthy hosts.",

This finding is consistent for bats and non-bats, and may be an accident 183 of geography, but more likely represents the tendency of human settlements to aggre-184 gate on continental edges and around biodiversity hotspots 66 . Regardless of mechanism, 185 we predict that tropical hotspots of novel viral sharing will broadly coincide with high 186 population density areas in 2070, especially in the Sahel, the Ethiopian highlands and 187 the Rift Valley, India, eastern China, Indonesia, and the Philippines (Figure 4). Some 188 gion like Usutu virus 67 highlight that these populations can still be vulnerable, despite 190 greater surveillance and healthcare access.

Rather, our results highlight the urgency of better wildlife 211 surveillance systems and health infrastructure as a form of climate change adaptation, 212 even if mitigation efforts are successful and global temperatures stay under +2\u00b0C. 213 Our study establishes a macroecological link between climate change and cross-species 214 viral transmission. In practice, the patterns we describe are likely to be complicated by 215 several ecological factors, including the temperature sensitivity of viral host jumps 68 ; 216 the possibility that defaunation especially at low elevations might interact with disease 217 prevalence through biodiversity dilution and amplification effects, not captured by our 218 models 69 ; or temporal heterogeneity in exposure (hosts might exchange viruses in passing 219 but not overlap by 2070, especially in warmer scenarios). Future work can also expand 220 the scope of our findings to other host-parasite systems; our novel approach, which 221 combines viral sharing models with massive species distribution modeling pipelines, is 222 readily applied to other datasets. Birds have the best documented virome after mammals, 223 and changing migration targets in a warming world may be especially important targets 224 for prediction. With amphibians facing disproportionately high extinction rates due 225 to a global fungal panzootic, and emerging threats like ranavirus causing conservation 226 concern, viral exchange among amphibians may be especially important information for 227 conservation practitioners 70 . Finally, marine mammals are an important target given 228 their exclusion here, especially after a recent study implicating reduced Arctic sea ice in 229 viral sharing among sympatric pinnipeds and sea otters-a result that may be the first 230 proof of concept for our proposed climate-disease link 71 . 231 Because hotspots of cross-species transmission are predictable, our study provides 232 the first template for how surveillance could target future hotspots of viral emergence in 233 wildlife. In the next decade alone, over a billion dollars could be spent on a proposed 234 global effort to identify zoonotic threats before they spread from wildlife reservoirs into 235 human populations 2 . These efforts are being undertaken during the greatest period 236 of global ecological change recorded in human history, and in a practical sense, the 237 rapid movement of species and formation of no-analog communities poses an unexpected 238 challenge for virological research. While several studies have addressed how range shifts 239 in zoonotic reservoirs might expose humans to novel viruses, few have considered the fact 240 that most new exposures will be among mammal species. Tracking spillover into humans 241 is paramount, but so is tracking of viral sharing in wildlife, and targeting surveillance in 242 hotspots of future sharing may help researchers identify host jumps early on.",

With that model, we map the pro-250 jected hotspots of new viral sharing in different futures. All analysis code is available at 251 github.com/cjcarlson/iceberg.252Mapping species distributions253    We developed species distribution models for a total of 3,870 species in this study, divided254 into two modeling pipelines based on data availability (ED Figures 8the Global Biodiversity Informatics Facility (GBIF) for mammal occurrence 257 records, and developed species distribution models for all 3,870 species with at least 3 258 unique terrestrial presence records on a 25 km by 25 km grid (one unique point per grid 259 cell). This grain was chosen based on the availability of future land use projections (see 260 below). Spatial and environmental outliers were removed based on Grubb outlier tests 261 (p-value of 1e-3) 72 . 262 Poisson point process models 263 For 3,088 species with at least 10 unique presence records, Poisson point process models 264 (closely related to Maxent) were fit using regularized downweighted Poisson regression 73 265 with 20,000 background points fit with the R package glmnet 74,75,74 . The spatial do-266 main of predictions was chosen based on the continent(s) where a species occurred in 267 their IUCN range map. We trained species distribution models on current climate data 268 using the WorldClim 2 data set 76 , using mean annual temperature, mean diurnal temper-269 ature range, annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation in warmest 270 quarter/ (precipitation in warmest quarter + precipitation in coldest quarter). These 271 predictors were chosen based on having global correlations <0.7 among one another. 272 These candidate predictors were further filtered on a species-by-species basis, retaining 273 the maximum number of predictors with correlation <0.7 within the domain where the 274 model was fit. 275 tial clusters to remove the influence of spatial autocorrelation on cross-validation perfor-277 mance statistics. Linear (all species), quadratic (species with >100 records), and product 278 (species with >200 records) features were used. The regularization parameter was de-279 termined based on 5-fold cross-validation with each fold, choosing a value 1 standard 280 deviation below the minimum deviance 77 . This resulted in five models per species which 281 were then combined in an unweighted ensemble. Continuous predictions of the ensemble 282 were converted to binary presence/absence predictions by choosing a threshold based on 283 the 5th percentile of the ensemble predictions at training presence locations. 284 When models were projected into the future, we limited extrapolation to 1 standard 285 deviation beyond the data range of presence locations for each predictor. This decision 286 balances a small amount of extrapolation based on patterns in a species niche with 287 limiting the influence of monotonically increasing marginal responses, which can lead to 288 statistically unsupported (and likely biologically unrealistic) responses to climate. 289 Range bagging models 290 For an additional 783 rare species (3 to 9 unique points on the 25 km grid), we produced 291 species distribution models with a simpler range bagging algorithm, a stochastic hull-292 based method that can estimate climate niches from an ensemble of underfit models 78,79 , 293 and is therefore well suited for smaller datasets. From the full collection of presence 294 observations and environmental variables range-bagging proceeds by randomly sampling 295 a subset of presences (proportion p) and a subset of environmental variables (d). From 296 these, a convex hull around the subset of points is generated in environmental space. The 297 hull is then projected onto the landscape with a location considered part of the species 298 range if its environmental conditions fall within the estimate hull. The subsampling is 299 replicated N times, generating N 'votes' for each cell on the landscape. One can then 300 choose a threshold for the number of votes required to consider the cell as part of the 301 species' range to generate the binary map used in our downstream analyses. Based on 302 general guidelines in 78 we chose p = 0.33, d = 2, and N = 100. We then chose the voting 303 threshold to be 0.165 (=0.33/2) because this implies that the cell is part of the range 304 at least half the time for each subsample. Upon visual inspection, this generally lead to 305 predictions that were very conservative about inferring that unsampled locations were 306 part of a species distribution. The same environmental predictors and ecoregion-based 307 domain selection rules were used for range bagging models as were used for the point 308 process models discussed above. This hull-based approach is particularly valuable for 309 poorly sampled species which may suffer from sampling bias because bias within niche 310 limits has little effect on range estimates. 311 spatial clustering to reduce inflation) of 0.77 (s.d. 0.13). The mean partial AUC eval-314 uated over a range of sensitivity relevant for SDM (0.8-0.95) was 0.8 (s.d. 0.08). The 315 mean sensitivity of binary maps used to assess range overlap (based on the 5% training 316 threshold used to make a binary map) was 0.89 (s.d. 0.08). Range bagging models were 317 difficult to meaningfully evaluate because they were based on extremely small sample 318 sizes (3-9). The mean training AUC (we did not perform cross-validation due to small 319 sample size) was 0.96 (s.d. 0.09). The binary maps had perfect sensitivity (1) because 320the threshold used to make them was chosen sufficiently low to include the handful of 321 known presences for each species. One way to assess how much we inferred the range 322 for these species is to quantify how much of the range was estimated based on out mod-323 els, based on the number of (10km) cells predicted to be part of the species range even324 when it was not observed there. The mean number of cells inferred to contain a presence 325 was 253 (s.d. 448); however, the distribution is highly right skewed with a median of 326 94. This indicates that the range bagging models were typically relatively conservative 327 about inferring ranges for poorly sampled species. 328 Habitat range and land use 329 We used the Land Use Harmonization version 2.0 (LUH2) gridded dataset to capture 330 global patterns in land cover for the present and future 80 .

For the current models, we used historical land-use maps (LUH2 333 v2h), which are intended for use over the period 850 to 2015 C.E. 81 . To capture species' 334 habitat preference, we collated data for all 3,870 mammal species from the IUCN Habitat 335 Classification Scheme version 3.1. We then mapped 104 unique IUCN habitat classifi-336 cations onto the eight land use types present in the LUH dataset. For 962 species, no 337",

We follow a rule391 proposed by Schloss et al. 31 , who described an approximate formula for mammal range 392 shift capacity based on body mass and trophic position. For carnivores, the maximum 393 distance traveled in a generation is given as D = 40.7M 0.81 , where D is distance in kilo-394 meters and M is body mass in kilograms. For herbivores and omnivores, the maximum 395 is estimated as D = 3.31M 0.65 . 396 We used mammalian diet data from the EltonTraits database 91 , and used the same 397 cutoff as Schloss to identify carnivores as any species with 10% or less plants in their 398 diet. We used body mass data from EltonTraits in the Schloss formula to estimate 399 maximum generational dispersal, and converted estimates to annual maximum dispersal 400 rates by dividing by generation length, as previously estimated by another comprehensive 401 mammal dataset 92 . We multiply by 50 years and use the resulting distance as a buffer 402 around the original range map, and constrain possible range shifts within that buffer. For 403 420 species with missing data in one of the required sources, we interpolated dispersal 404 distance based on the closest relative in our supertree with a dispersal velocity estimate. 405 Qualified by the downsides of assuming full dispersal 93 , we excluded bats from the 406 assumed scaling of dispersal limitations. The original study by Schloss et al. 31 chose 407 to omit bats entirely, and subsequent work has not proposed any alternative formula. 408 Moreover, the Schloss formula performs notably poorly for bats: for example, it would 409 assign the largest bat in our study, the Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus), a disper-410 sal capacity lower than that of the gray dwarf hamster (Cricetulus migratorius). Bats 411were instead given full dispersal in all scenarios: given significant evidence that some bat 412 species regularly cover continental distances 43,44 , and that isolation by distance is uncom-413 mon within many bats' ranges 46 , we felt this was a defensible assumption for modeling 414 purposes. Moving forward, the rapid range shifts already observed in many bat species 415 (see main text) could provide an empirical reference point to fit a new allometric scaling 416 curve (after standardizing those results for the studies' many different methodologies).417A different set of functional traits likely govern the scaling of bat dispersal, chiefly the 418 aspect ratio (length:width) of wings, which is a strong predictor of population genetic 419 differentiation 46 . Migratory status would also be important to include as a predictor 420 although here, we exclude information on long-distance migration for all species (due to 421 a lack of any real framework for adding that information to species distribution models 422 in the literature).",

We fitted a model for each scenario and pair of biological assumptions; 434 because of the large effect bats had on the overall pattern, we retrained these models on 435 subsets of encounters with and without a bat species involved. To help model fitting, we 436 log(x+1)-transformed the response variable (number of overlaps in the pixel) and both 437 continuous explanatory variables (meters of elevation above the lowest point and species 438 richness). Because some elevation values were lower than 0 (i.e., below sea level), we 439 treated elevation as meters above the lowest terrestrial point rather than meters above 440 sea level to allow us to log-transform the data. used a previously-published model of the phylogeography of viral sharing patterns 444 to make predictions of future viral sharing 17 . This model was based on an analysis of 445 510 viruses shared between 682 mammal species 3 , and predicted the probability that a 446 pair of mammal species will share a virus given their geographic range overlap and phy-447 logenetic relatedness.

Hosts 507 were taken from two sources: the training dataset on host-virus associations 3 , and an 508 additional dataset of filovirus testing in bats 30 . In the latter case, any bats that have 509 been reported antibody positive or PCR-positive for ZEBOV were included. A total 510 of 13 current \"known hosts\" in Africa were used to predict current possible hosts, and 511 first encounters in all scenarios. We restricted our analysis to Africa because there is 512 no published evidence that Zaire ebolavirus actively circulates outside Africa; although 513 some bat species outside Africa have tested positive for antibodies to ZEBOV, this is 514 likely due to cross-reactivity with other undiscovered filoviruses 95,96,30 . 515 Overlap with human populations 516 To examine the possibility that hotspots of cross-species transmission would overlap with 517 human populations, we used SEDAC's global population projections version 1.0 for the 518year 2070 97 .

Edge width denotes the expected number of shared viruses (the sum of pairwise species-species viral sharing probabilities), with most sharing existing among the most speciose and closely-related groups. Edges shown in the network are the top 25% of links. Nodes are sized by total number of species in that order in the host-virus association dataset, color is scaled by degree.

Viral sharing increases as a function of phylogenetic similarity (A) and geographic overlap (B), fit together as a tensor interaction (C). White contour lines denote 10% increments of sharing probability. Declines at high values of overlap may be an artefact of model structure and low sampling in the upper levels of geographic overlap, shown in a hexagonal bin chart for raw data (D).
