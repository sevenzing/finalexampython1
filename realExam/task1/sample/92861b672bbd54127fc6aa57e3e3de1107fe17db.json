            "text": "The use of the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay to evaluate cellular immune responses \u03b3 has gained increasing popularity, especially as a surrogate measure for CTL responses. We developed and validated some modifications of the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay to optimize immunological monitoring of various cancer vaccine trials. Taking into consideration that the main mechanism of cellmediated cytotoxicity is the release of cytolytic granules that contain, among others, cytolytic protein Granzyme B (GrB), we developed the GrB ELISPOT assay. Extensive studies demonstrated that the GrB ELISPOT assay is specific, accurately measures the rapid release of GrB, is more sensitive than the 51Crrelease assay, and that it may be successfully applied to measuring CTL precursory frequency in PBMC from cancer patients. Assuming that immunological assays that demonstrate recognition of native tumor cells (tumor-specific) may be more clinically relevant than assays that demonstrate recognition of tumor protein or peptide (antigen-specific), we developed and validated the Autologous Tumor IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay using PBMC from \u03b3 idiotype vaccinated lymphoma patients as effectors and autologous B cell lymphoma tumor cells as targets. The precursor frequency of tumor-reactive T cells was significantly higher in the postvaccine PBMC, compared with prevaccine samples in all patients tested. Furthermore, the specificity of these T cells was established by the lack of reactivity against autologous normal B cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating tumor-specific T cell responses when autologous, primary tumor cells are available as targets. Modifications of ELISPOT assay described in this chapter allow more comprehensive assessment of low frequency tumor-specific CTL and their specific effector functions and can provide valuable insight with regards to immune responses in cancer vaccine trials.",

            "text": "Active specific immunotherapy is a promising but investigational modality in the management of cancer patients. Currently, several different cancer vaccine formulations such as peptides, proteins, antigen-pulsed dendritic cells, whole tumor cells, etc. in combination with various adjuvants and carriers are being evaluated in clinical trials (1) (2) (3) . To determine the optimal cancer vaccine strategy, a surrogate immunological end-point that correlates with clinical outcome needs to be defined, since it would facilitate the rapid comparison of these various formulations. Traditional immunological assays such as ELISA, proliferation and cytotoxicity assays can detect immune responses in vaccinated patients but are not quantitative. In contrast, novel assays such as enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, intracellular cytokine assay and tetramer assay can quantitate the frequency of antigen-specific T cells. Of these, the ELISPOT assay has the lowest detection limit with 1/10 5 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and has been determined to be one of the most useful assays to evaluate immune response to cancer vaccines (4) . However, the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay is not an exclusive measure of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity as non-cytotoxic cells can also secrete IFN-\u03b3. Additionally, \u03b3 \u03b3 CTL with lytic activity do not always secrete IFN-\u03b3 (5) . A more relevant \u03b3 approach to assess functional activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes would be to measure the secretion of molecules that are associated with lytic activity.",

            "text": "Cell-mediated cytotoxicity has conventionally been measured using the standard 51 Cr-release assay (22) , which assesses CTL and NK cell functions via lysis of radioisotope-labeled target cells. This assay is considered to be the gold standard to evaluate CTL lytic activity. Recently, the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay has become a surrogate measure of CTL responses. We compared the GrB ELISPOT assay to the 51 Cr-release and IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT \u03b3 assays to evaluate its ability to quantify CTL lytic responses (Figure 2 ). Both ELISPOT assays were significantly more sensitive than the 51 Cr-release assay. At effector to target ratios of 50:1-12:1, specific lysis was measurable via the 51 Cr-release assay, but the spots per well in the ELISPOT assays were too numerous to count accurately (data not shown). Significant IFN-\u03b3 and \u03b3 GrB secretion was evident even at E:T ratios as low as 0.2:1, below the level of sensitivity of the 51 Cr-release assay. However, when the optimal number of CTL are used in each individual assay, the amount of GrB and IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells in the ELISPOT assays and cytotoxicity in the 51 Cr-release assay have shown excellent cross-correlation with R 2 above 0.95 for all three assays. Correlation of GrB and IFN-\u03b3 secretion in the ELISPOT assays with cytotoxicity in \u03b3 51Cr-release assay. Human \u03b1-FMP-CTL (7 day culture) were used as effector cells. Target cells were C1R.A2 (ELISPOT) or T2 (51Cr-release) pulsed with FMP, 5x103 cells per well. Incubation time was 4 h at 37\u00b0C for all three assays. At the 10:1 effector to target ratio the spots in the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay were too numerous to count. Background (CTL alone) \u03b3 was subtracted from the results. Data is representative of 3 experiments. Modified from (13) To further confirm that we were measuring CTL activity, we removed CD8 + cells from the cultures using anti-CD8 mAb and magnetic beads. After depletion, the percentage of CD8 + cells in the cultures was decreased from 24.8\u00b12.9% to 2.7\u00b10.4% and an abrogation of GrB secretion was observed ( Figure 3) . These results show that at least in this system GrB is secreted by CD8 + cells. The dynamics of GrB and IFN-\u03b3 secretion differ. Granzyme B secretion \u03b3 was detectible as early as 10 min after initial contact of effectors and targets in most experiments. Significant amounts of GrB spots were observed within 30 min of incubation with maximal secretion at 4 h. In contrast, measurable amounts of IFN-\u03b3 spots were found only after 1 h of incubation with \u03b3 significant IFN-\u03b3 secretion measured at 4 h (13).",

When CTL interact with target cells, IFN-\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 is secreted within hours whereas GrB is released very rapidly (within minutes) from preformed granules. Using effector cells with NK activity, we have shown that treatment with Brefeldin A, a protein secretion blocker, significantly decreases IFN-\u03b3 but not GrB \u03b3 secretion. In contrast, BAPTA-AM, which sequesters intra-cellular calcium and therefore inhibits degranulation, abrogated GrB secretion (manuscript in preparation). The fact that the number of effectors spontaneously secreting GrB is higher than the number secreting IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 1 ), \u03b3 suggests that the GrB measured in the ELISPOT could be present in preformed granules. However, the spontaneous release of GrB could also be due to the activation state of cytotoxic cells.

Firstly, tumor-specific assays can potentially detect both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses since endogenous antigens are presented by both MHC class I and class II molecules (29) . In contrast, antigen-specific (protein) assays detect mostly CD4 + T cell responses since the soluble exogenous antigen is predominantly processed in the endosomal pathway and presented on MHC class II molecules. Secondly, tumor-specific assays can be used in patients with any HLA phenotype unlike peptide assays that are usually restricted to a single HLA phenotype (e.g. HLA-A*0201) depending on the binding affinity of the peptide. Thirdly, tumor-specific assays allow monitoring of patients when whole or lysed tumor cells are used as the immunogen and the tumor-specific antigens have not been defined. A probable limitation for tumor recognition assays is the availability of tumor cells. While primary tumor cells are easily accessible for some cancers (e.g. lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, melanoma), they may not be generally accessible for certain other cancers (e.g. breast cancer, renal cell cancer). When available, it may be feasible to adapt the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT \u03b3 assay for the quantitative assessment of T cell responses against primary tumor cells as a preferable alternative to antigen-specific assays.",

The C1R.A2 human plasma leukemia cell line which expresses a transfected genomic clone of HLA-A2.1 was cultured in CM supplemented with 500 \u00b5g/ml of G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The T2 human lymphoblastoma Tap-deficient cell line (ATCC, Manassa, VA) was cultured in IMDM medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 20% FBS (Hyclone), 100 U/ml Penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin. All target cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2. Prior to use in assays, C1R.A2 or T2 target cells were pulsed with HLA-A2 binding peptides for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2.",
