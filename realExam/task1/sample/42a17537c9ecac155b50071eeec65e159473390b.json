Specifically, the virus is primarily spread between people during close 26 contact,often via small droplets produced by coughing,sneezing, or 27 talking [9] [10] [5] [6] [13] . After breathing out produces these droplets, they usually fall 28 to the ground or on to surfaces rather than remain in the air over long 29 distances [9] [6] [7] .

The interpretation is that the NPIs yield an overall 132 mitigation of the epidemic spread by 20% and 30% respectively. An attack rate of 67% 133 was assumed. This led to considering total population N as the product of attack rate 134 and the total population of Kenya, which is approximately 5.02 \u00d7 10 7 .

Our model predicts that if the overall control measures 147 achieves 20% effectiveness in slowing the spread of COVID-19, then a delay of slightly 2 148 months is realized, which allows the health care systems time of gathering resources to 149 manage the epidemic.
