In arriving at this level of activity, we assumed that the city has 8,000 beds for COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization in addition to 1,500 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients.",

A key benefit of restricting workplaces to start operation at a low level is that it keeps the occupancy on the suburban trains and buses at a similar low level, thereby reducing infection spread in crowded public transit systems. (See [4] for some speculation on the impact of the New York City (NYC) subway system on COVID-19 spread in NYC.) Furthermore, by starting slowly, the city gets a chance to assess the impact of infection spread in trains and respond appropriately in terms of future relaxations or restrictions on train occupancy.",

To mitigate hardship to the public during this extended lockdown period, the Ministry of Home Affairs, in its orders dated 15 April 2020 [5] , 1 May 2020 [6] , and 17 May 2020 [7] , allowed certain activities to take place subject to operationalization by states, union territories and district administrations. These local administrations, if they deem appropriate, may impose stricter measures by not allowing these activities to take place. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards; however, containment zones will continue to be in lockdown 3 . Mumbai has witnessed both the largest number of cases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368 deaths as of 02 June 2020 [2] ). Consequently, Mumbai is likely to be operating with containment zone restrictions, and many tough decisions will be made on re-opening in the next few days.",

These interventions reduce the opportunities for infection-spreading contacts between the infective individuals and the susceptible individuals in the city.

This implies the person no longer goes to work, the household members remains at home, and the visits to the community centers are lowered significantly.

Various studies suggest that the use of masks considerably reduces the transmission of respiratory virus diseases in workplaces, community and transport spaces [12] - [15] . Face masks may help in three significant ways. They may directly reduce the spread of the respiratory pathogen. They may help reduce the inhalation of the respiratory pathogen. They may also reduce hand-to-face contact. We model the effectiveness of masks by reducing the ability of an infectious individual to transmit the infection by 20%, and by reducing the chances of a susceptible individual contracting the infection by 20%, if a mask is worn. 6) Compliance levels: It is upfront unclear as to the extent to which orders on case isolation, home quarantines and masks are complied with by the population. In fact mobility results [16] suggest that there is still significant movement of people. To this end, we bring a compliance factor into our simulation. Even under the strictest of lockdowns, compliance is lower in high-density areas where individuals do not have the luxury of many individual facilities, e.g., toilets, and are forced to access shared facilities. We assume 40% compliance to lockdown restrictions in such high-density areas and 60% in other areas. We also compare these results with increased levels of compliance.",

In Figures 1a-1b , we attempt to capture only those requiring medical intervention associated with essential hospitalization. Another point to highlight is the oscillating behaviour in the number of daily hospitalized and critical cases in Figures 1a and 1c . This comes from our specific modelling of containment zones. As the number of hospitalized cases in a ward increases, a partial lockdown in proportion to the number of hospitalized cases comes into play. When the number of hospitalizations exceeds a threshold a full lockdown is enforced. Conversely, as the number hospitalized cases reduces and is below the aforementioned threshold, the partial lockdown is appropriately eased.",

The first figure in Figure 3 plots the cumulative number of active cases, recovered cases and fatalities as a function of time, the second figure plots a finer daily sub-division of those exposed to the disease (exposed, asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, severe symptomatic, hospitalized, critical and 2) We have assumed asymptomatic infections to be 33%. Literature suggests that this lies between 20-60% [17] - [19] . A lower percentage of asymptomatic infections would imply a higher daily requirement of hospital beds, and a higher percentage would imply a lower daily requirement of hospital beds. Again, it is important to keep in mind that trains may lead to more infections than suggested by our model. 21 3) We have used Wuhan based disease progression analysis [11] , [18] . Availability of Indian data would greatly help the accuracy of the generated scenarios. 4) Finally, we end with a caveat that simulation numbers are sensitive to how well the containment zones are managed as well as the compliance levels. Managing these as well as other measures such as social distancing, masks, aggressive contact tracing are critical to keeping the health degradation numbers low. The assumptions of our model are similar to those in the first report. We refer the reader to the first report [3] for details on the agent-based model, how the synthetic city is constructed, the assumptions therein. We state below the additional assumptions to incorporate the new interventions in this report. 1) Case Isolation and Home Quarantine: After 24 hours of a person showing symptoms, the person and the family is set to be quarantined. This implies the person no longer goes to work, the family remains at home, household interactions reduce by 25%, and the visits to the community centers are lowered significantly to 10% of the usual.",

We assume that during normal operation of the trains (i.e., before the epidemic) during peak commute hours, an individual would have close interactions at the rate r T during a train commute, where in a train commute we include last-mile means of transport such as buses or shared auto-rickshaws/taxis. The rate parameter governing an individual getting an infection during commute, if all her close interactions were with infectious individuals, is then \u03c1 T := c \u00b7 r T = r T r H \u00b7 \u03b2 H . (To estimate the actual rate of infection, \u03c1 T will need to be attenuated by the factors f infectious and f travel defined above, in order to account for the fact that not all close interactions will be with infectious individuals.) Let s be the average speed of commute (including, as above, last-mile means of transport), so that \u03c4 a := d a /s is an estimate of the time of the (one-way) commute of individual a. Thus, during a time step t of the simulation which includes one direction of the individual's commute, the contribution of the commute to the instantaneous infection rate \u03bb a (t) of the individual (amortized over the length \u2206t = 1/4 day of the time-step) can be taken to be",
