We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site (RRARSVAS), absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, that results in mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel \u03b1-subunit (ENaC-\u03b1). Genetic truncation at this ENaC\u03b1 cleavage site causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting the functional importance of the mimicked SARS-CoV-2 peptide. Single cell RNA-seq from 65 studies shows significant overlap between the expression of ENaC-\u03b1 and ACE2, the putative receptor for the virus, in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular fingerprint with amino acid cleavage signatures of 178 human proteases shows the potential for tissue-specific proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. We extrapolate that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global coronavirus pandemic may be in part due to its targeted mimicry of human ENaC and hijack of the associated host proteolytic network.",

PCSK5 and PCSK7 are broadly expressed across multiple cell types with ACE2 and ENaC-\u0251, making it a plausible broad-spectrum protease that may cleave the S1/S2 site. In humans, concomitant with ACE2 and ENaC-\u0251, PCSK6 appears to be expressed in cells from the intestines, pancreas, and lungs, whereas PCSK2 is noted to be co-expressed in the respiratory tract and the pancreas (Figure 2) . It is worth noting that the extracellular proteases need not necessarily be expressed in the same cells as ACE2 and ENaC-\u0251.
