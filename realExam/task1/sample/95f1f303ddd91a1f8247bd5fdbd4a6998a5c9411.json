Low-income Hispanic primary care patients with hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] \u2265 9% received care managment (CM) over 6 months classified as: (CM1) telephone only; (CM2) clinic visit but no calls; (CM3) clinic visit with calls; and (CM4) \u2265 2 visits \u00b1 calls. Type of CM delivery and time to DM control (HbA1c < 9%) examined in Cox proportional hazards model and more rapid control within 6 months using logistic regression. Models adjusted for demographics, clinical, and health care variables. At baseline, 523 patients had mean HbA1c 10.9% (SD = 1.7%), mean age 57.9 years (SD = 10), 58.5% women, 87.6% Hispanic, and 55.5% uninsured.

Among 523 primarily Hispanic primary care subjects with poor diabetes control, this 3-year observational pilot study suggests that CHW contact only by telephone (CM1) was less likely to achieve control over time compared with face-to-face meetings (CM2 and CM4). This difference translated into a median of more than 150 days longer to achieve control for subjects receiving CM1 (350 days) than for those with either CM2 and CM4 (both less than 200 days). Our study also found that patients who received either CM2 or CM4 had approximately two-fold higher adjusted odds of achieving control more rapidly within 6 months after CM initiation as compared to CM1.",

It is possible that these individuals required only limited support to address their barriers to following the treatment plan. Future studies should aim to identify characteristics of patients with uncontrolled diabetes who might not require more intensive face-to-face CHW support because CHW interventions have usually involved numerous encounters. A trial of four CHW home visits with an average of 20 telephone calls achieved a significant reduction in HbA1c [15] . Similarly, up to 36 home visits by CHWs plus calls significantly reduced HbA1c among Mexican-American subjects at 1 and 2 years follow-up [16] . Among subjects with mean baseline HbA1c 9.6%, a CHW intervention of up to 17 visits reduced mean HbA1c by 0.47% at 6 months versus controls and was maintained after 12 and 18 months [17] . However, the sustainability of CHW support for low income primary care patients requires attention to the infrastructure required for in-person clinic encounters including space, CHW time, and systems to encourage patients to take advantage of this resource.",

Not only is the age-standardized prevalence of diabetes in Hispanics over twice that of non-Hispanic whites [18] , but, nationally, less than half of Hispanics with diabetes achieved a HbA1c < 7% [19] . Gratifyingly, the mean reduction in HbA1c for our entire cohort was \u2212 1.37% supporting a clinically significant improvement but the reduction was even greater for the group with a face-to-face visit (\u2212 1.58% HbA1c). Types of CM received did not differ significantly by subjects' demographic characteristics. However, the comorbidity score did differ and may indicate the type of subjects who need to be targeted with in-person support. Patients who received a face-to-face meeting and both phone calls (CM3) comprised only 9% of the cohort but did not significantly improve versus CM1. It is possible these patients did not accept another meeting in clinic because they did not want CHW help. The favorable association of CM4, the group with multiple visits with or without calls, was not significant in the time to event analysis but was associated with nearly two-times greater adjusted odds of control within 6 months.",

However, our analyses adjusted for multiple factors that can influence achievement of control. Second, the funding agency set HbA1c < 9% for diabetes control, similar to other studies in Medicaid enrollees [20] . Yet, a reduction of HbA1c to < 9% would not protect against diabetes-related complications [21] . Still, the reduction in HbA1c at 6 months for our cohort (\u2212 1.38%) was greater than the mean -0.45% observed for another CHW intervention in Hispanics [22] . Third, although type and intensity of diabetes medications prescribed at baseline were significantly associated with achievement of control, unmeasured medication adjustments during receipt of CHW support may have also influenced outcomes. Fourth, this study was conducted in two primary care practices serving largely uninsured, Hispanic patients and may not be relevant to practices serving different populations.",
