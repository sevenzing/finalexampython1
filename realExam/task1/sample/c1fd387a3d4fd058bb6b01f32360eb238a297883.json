In late December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, linked to a seafood and animal wholesale market there, began to surface. By January 3, 2020, 44 cases were reported in China. Chinese authorities isolated a novel coronavirus, on January 7, 2020, and shared its genetic sequence on January 12. It was identified in Thailand on January 13, Japan on January 15, and January 20 in Korea. Deaths were already being reported in China. The first case in the United States was reported on January 21, a U.S. citizen who had been in Wuhan. Human to human transmission was suggested by January 24, and by the 25th it had spread to Australia and France. By January 27 it was confirmed in 11 countries outside of China. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the COVID-19 outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The first two cases were reported in Italy on January 31 (World Health Organization, 2020a). The spread continued, and on March 11 WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, acknowledging the disease's geographical spread. On March 16, the total number of cases and deaths outside China surpassed the totals in China. On March 24, 2020, the date of this writing, there are 395,647 confirmed cases and 17,240 deaths worldwide (Johns Hopkins University Medicine, 2020). These numbers will certainly be higher at publication.",

Another population of concern is pregnant women. The other two well-known coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) have both been documented as causing severe maternal and perinatal complications during pregnancy (Alfaraj et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2004) . At this point there are sparse reports of COVID-19 in pregnant women. Chen et al. (2020) reported nine cases, all in their third trimester, from Wuhan in January 2020. All nine women delivered liveborn healthy infants via cesarean deliveries, with no significant complications. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, and milk samples from six of the mothers were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. We will come back to this finding. Liu et al. (2020) identified 13 COVID-19 positive hospitalized pregnant women officially reported by the central government of China outside of Wuhan between December 8, 2019 and February 25, 2020. Three women improved and were discharged with ongoing pregnancies. The other 10 underwent cesarean deliveries because of complications, including preterm labor and one stillbirth. One mother developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). At the time of publication of that article she was still on ECMO. The other nine mothers and eight liveborn infants were discharged home well. \"There was no clinical or serologic evidence suggestive of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2\" (Liu et al., 2020) . But there was also no mention of evaluating the mothers' milk.",

She founded the first donor milk bank in China. Partially in English and partially through a translator, (Virginia Chi Cheng Tam, IBCLC, Macau Breastfeeding and Nurturing Promotion Association, Macau, People's Republic of China) Professor Liu has told me that both the supply and the demand of donor milk in China has decreased significantly with this infection. The milk banking processes were already quite strict prior to COVID-19, especially donor screening. However, screening has become \"more careful and rigorous\". Prior to the outbreak, donors could express milk in their homes and deliver it to the hospitals (where milk banks are located). Technicians would also sometimes make milk pickups from donor homes. Both have now stopped. All milk is expressed in person. A donor's temperature is taken, and she is required to fill out a questionnaire, including questions about whether she has herself been to or been in contact with anyone who has been to an epidemic area in the past 14 days. Almost every donor is asked to come to the hospital to donate, and all milk from home is refused. In some places, collections are made at the gates to communities from healthy, non-exposed donors. The containers are always supplied by the milk banks. As Professor Liu told me via text messaging on WhatsApp:",

First, people are trying not to go outside, so [there are] fewer patients in the hospital, fewer patients come to the hospital, and fewer donors come to donate their milk. Of course, the demand and supply has been greatly reduced. We will decrease quantity but not quality. In the People's Republic of China, milk banks only provide donor milk to hospitalized patients, not even for outpatient departments, let alone infants in society. The demand has also come down for milk, because less people venture to go to the hospitals. Even when people are sick, they stay away from the hospitals, assuming healthcare facilities are filled with COVID-19. Folks with other sicknesses do not stay in the hospitals as much during the outbreak, therefore both supply and demand of donor milk have decreased (Professor Xihong Liu, personal communication, March 17, 2020 As you probably know, in Italy, we are forced to live in our houses without any possibility to go out (we are permitted to go out only for buying foods in supermarkets), and all the activities of our country are completely blocked. We do not know how long the health system and the economy of our country will be able to tolerate this situation. At the moment we are the only country in Europe with such extreme measures, but [we are] sure that in a couple of weeks also the other European country will be in a similar situation. Concerning your request, we can only tell you that donation of human milk has decreased a lot in this period: people cannot go out to bring the milk to the Banks, and even if theoretically they can be justified for their action of social value, mothers in this period prefer to stay as far as possible from hospitals. The other alternative is home milk collections from the banks, but also this activity has been reduced drastically because all the efforts of the hospitals are devoted to take care of people infected by COVID-19. In Milan we have a special system of home milk collection, called Human Milk Link, that is serving the three Human Milk Banks of the city of Milan. It is performed by a nurse, specialized in lactation, who is driving the car, collecting the milk and giving breastfeeding advices to the mothers. This service has been stopped exactly one week ago, Monday, March 9, 2020. So, donation of human milk in Milan has been practically suspended. This is the only information we can give you related to the situation of human milk donation and human milk banks in Italy in this period (personal communication, March 16, 2020). I asked if an infant is in NICU and the mother is a person under investigations (PUI) or COVID positive, are they handling her expressed milk any differently? Are they decontaminating the outside of the containers her milk is expressed into, after she expresses it, before it is stored in the NICU refrigerators or freezers? They responded: Indications in our country for PUI or COVID positive mothers who are expressing their milk are: they should utilize sterile containers (so no need for any specific treatment), should put on a facemask and practice a very careful hand hygiene before each feeding or other close contact with her newborn. The facemask should remain in place during contact with the newborn. These practices should continue while the mother is on transmission-based precautions in a healthcare facility (personal communication, March 16, 2020 There is heightened anxiety in donors who must interact with the healthcare system to have their screening bloods drawn, or when they interact to drop off their milk at the milk bank, and with healthcare providers and recipients concerning the provision of the donor milk, i.e. \"is it safe?\". We are currently engaged in educating mothers that we have no evidence of coronaviruses transmission through human milk, and that previous coronaviruses, although also not found in human milk, have been destroyed by pasteurization.",

For emergency preparedness we have ordered extra supplies. As face masks are in short supply in the United States, and we do not wear them to protect ourselves but to protect the milk, one of our staff members is sewing masks that we can launder daily if we run out of disposables. If we cannot use our delivery services for the milk (United Parcel Service, FedEx), then we will deliver the milk ourselves. We cover two states and, from our milk bank, that is a 6-hour drive in each direction. We have increased production, so we have pasteurized milk as opposed to raw milk in our freezers should the donor supply dwindle. We are reaching out to our donors now to request more milk before the situation worsens here. We use milk depots throughout our catchment areas to which donor mothers can deliver their milk close to home, and from which it is shipped to us. Should these be closed due to government orders to enforce social distancing, as long as shipping options remain, we can still receive milk from donors.

Donor milk banking is predicated always on the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding. We believe this deadly virus is not transmitted through mother's milk. We do not know if there is vertical transmission or not. As of this writing we are beginning to hear reports that the youngest among us may be a high-risk group, as they are with other viruses. As this is a novel virus, we, as a community, have not previously been exposed to it. There may not be specific immune factors against it in human milk, yet. But, as we know, there are so many immune factors in, and immune functions of, human milk, that its provision to our youngest and very vulnerable must continue to be of paramount importance. We know of one infected mother who had anti-SARS-1 antibody in her milk postpartum (Robertson et al., 2004) . The ability to provide support and to protect our breastfeeding mothers becomes extremely difficult where the virus is rampant. With social distancing, how do we provide the care, support, and protection these mothers need? In my discussions with my colleagues in Italy and China I heard the angst in their voices as they lamented their inability to see mothers and babies and provide this most basic of supports. If we cannot support breastfeeding, how will we ensure a supply of donor milk? In populations with large areas under quarantine or \"lockdown\", how are we to move \"safe\" milk from the donors to the milk banks? In the bigger picture, what does this mean for the health of our children, as we may in fact see breastfeeding rates, and the supply and use of donor milk, decrease during this very unstable and concerning of times. insurmountable odds they all face in this pandemic, to inform this article. Thank you for all your hard work here, and with those you serve. Be safe.",

It includes a table describing various scenarios of a mother's health and an infant's status, with breastfeeding or use of expressed milk. They are making every effort to ensure that mothers who can breastfeed do so and, if they cannot, that their milk is given to their infants. I am the volunteer Co-Medical Director of the Mother's Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes, a Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) non-profit milk bank located in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA (https://www. milkbankwgl. org/). I spoke by telephone with our Executive Director, Summer Kelly, MS, RN, IBCLC on March 16, about the effects coronavirus is having on our milk bank.
