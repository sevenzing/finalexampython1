Few studies have investigated the clinical predictors of viral pneumonia, and the results have been inconsistent. In this study, the clinical predictors of viral pneumonia were investigated in terms of their utility as indicators for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP. Methods: Adult patients ($18 years old) with CAP, tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory virus, at two teaching hospitals between October 2010 and May 2013, were identified retrospectively. Demographic and clinical data were collected by reviewing the hospital electronic medical records. Results: During the study period, 456 patients with CAP were identified who met the definition, and 327 (72%) patients were tested using the respiratory virus PCR detection test. Viral pneumonia (n560) was associated with rhinorrhea, a higher lymphocyte fraction in the white blood cells, lower serum creatinine and groundglass opacity (GGO) in radiology results, compared to non-viral pneumonia (n5250) (p,0.05, each). In a multivariate analysis, rhinorrhea (Odd ratio (OR) 3.52; 95% Confidence interval (CI), 1.58-7.87) and GGO (OR 4.68; 95% CI, were revealed as independent risk factors for viral pneumonia in patients with CAP.

First, the etiologic microorganism was heterogeneous and not identified in 50% of patients with non-viral CAP. For this reason, Influenza pneumonia was compared, additionally, with only pneumococcal pneumonia which mostly accounts for CAP and similar results. Second, although this study was undertaken at two hospitals, they were referral centers, not primary health-care clinics. There is the possibility that patients with less severe CAP could have been included if data from a primary healthcare clinic had been available. Third, because of the retrospective study design, 28% of the CAP patients were not tested using the respiratory virus PCR test and were excluded from the study, although the medical doctors were educated and were in consensus regarding the routine prescription of the respiratory virus PCR for correct etiologic diagnosis of CAP patients at our hospital. Because the factors influencing the physicians' decision to prescribe respiratory virus PCR were not determined, they may have influenced our results as unmeasured confounding factors in the analysis. Fourth, we did not perform bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia because its diagnostic role in viral pneumonia is still not well defined and review articles still recommend upper respiratory specimens for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia [7, 10, 32] . Fifth, serum procalcitonin levels, which indicate the acute phase of bacterial CAP, were not reviewed and analyzed in this study, because procalcitonin was not checked routinely in all patients. Further study is needed to evaluate the usefulness of novel biomarkers for predicting viral pneumonia in CAP, including procalcitonin.
