A novel coronavirus, initially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of this disease by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (3) . This disease, now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO, rapidly spread to other cities of China, and has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) following its global spread. COVID-19 clinically manifests as fever, cough, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea and pneumonia, and can cause death in severe cases (4) (5) (6) . Up through March 20, 2020, China has reported 81008 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 3,255 fatalities (7) .",

A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low circulating lymphocyte counts (4) (5) (6) . However, the factors which might cause the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain uninvestigated. We retrospectively analyze here the clinical data from 522 cases of COVID-19 who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theater Command and Hanyang Hospital in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020. We also compare the expression of exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on the surface of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Our results thus provide a preliminary demonstration of T cell exhaustion during COVID-19 infection and suggest that more urgent, early intervention may be required in patients with low T lymphocyte counts.",

The illness period (overtly symptomatic period) is a phase in which the signs or symptoms of disease are most obvious and severe, with positive laboratory findings and chest/lung pathological manifestations. For ICU patients, ICU period is a phase in which the symptoms are most obvious and severe.

In this report, we retrospectively reviewed the numbers of total T cells, CD4 + , CD8 + T cell subsets in a total of 499 COVID-19 patients.

This phenomenon has been considered an important contributor to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (17, 18) . It has been also implicated in the setting of respiratory viral infections, such as SARS in 2002, avian H5N1 influenza virus infection in 2005 and H7N9 infection in 2013 (19) (20) (21) (22) . Huang et al. showed that the levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1A were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (4). Consistent with this report, here we found that the secretion of cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 was increased in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the numbers of total T cells, CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells are negatively correlated to levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10, respectively (Figure 2B ), suggesting these cytokines may be involved in the decrease of T cells detected in COVID-19.",

Our current analysis demonstrated that patients over 60 years old have lower T cell numbers, indicating that TNF-\u03b1 might be directly involved in inducing T cell loss in these patients. IL-6, when promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and tissue injuries, contributes to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses or immune reactions. Dysregulated and continual synthesis of IL-6 has been shown to play a pathological role in chronic inflammation and infection (25, 26) . Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has been developed and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (27, 28) . Moreover, tocilizumab has been shown to be effective against cytokine release syndrome resulting from CAR-T cell infusion against B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (29) . Whether tocilizumab can restore T cell counts in COVID-19 patients by suppressing IL-6 signaling remains uninvestigated.",

While previous studies have validated that the secretion of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1, mostly derives from T cells, macrophages and monocytes etc. (30, 31) , based on our (inverse correlation) results, we suggest that the secretion of these cytokines does not originate from T cells. However, the cytokine storm in turn may promote apoptosis or necrosis of T cells, and consequently leads to their reduction. Our previous work demonstrated that monocytes and macrophages can produce pro-inflammatory cytokine during murine hepatitis virus strain-3 infection (32, 33) , yet whether SARS-CoV-2 also triggers cytokine release from monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 patients needs further investigation and current work around this is in progress in our hospital.",

It is defined by poor effector function, sustained expression of inhibitory receptors, and a transcriptional state distinct from that of functional effector or memory T cells (34) . By FACS analysis, we found that both CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T cells have higher levels of PD-1 in virus infected patients, particularly in ICU patients (Figure 3) . IL-10, an inhibitory cytokine, not only prevents T cell proliferation, but also can induce T cell exhaustion. Importantly, blocking IL-10 function has been shown to successfully prevent T cell exhaustion in animal models of chronic infection (35, 36) . We demonstrate here that COVID-19 patients have very high levels of serum IL-10 following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while also displaying high levels of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their T cells, suggesting that IL-10 might be mechanistically responsible. The application of potent antiviral treatments to prevent the progression to T cell exhaustion in susceptible patients may thus be critical to their recovery. We have read with great interest the successful application of Remdesivir to cure a COVID-19 patient in the US, and clinical trials indicate that this drug may have significant potential as an antiviral (37, 38) .",
