            "text": "Electroencephalography (EEG) studies produce regionreferenced functional data in the form of EEG signals recorded across electrodes on the scalp. The high-dimensional data capture underlying neural dynamics and it is of clinical interest to model differences in neurodevelopmental trajectories between diagnostic groups, for example typically developing (TD) children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In such cases, valid group-level inference requires characterization of the complex EEG dependency structure as well as covariate-dependent heteroscedasticity, such as changes in variation over developmental age. In our motivating study, resting state EEG is collected on both TD and ASD children aged two to twelve years old. The peak alpha frequency (PAF), defined as the location of a prominent peak in the alpha frequency band of the spectral density, is an important biomarker linked to neurodevelopment and is known to shift from lower to higher frequencies as children age. To retain the most amount of information from the data, we model patterns of alpha spectral variation, rather than just the peak location, regionally across the scalp and chronologically across development for both the TD and ASD diagnostic groups. We propose a covariate-adjusted hybrid principal components analysis (CA-HPCA) for region-referenced functional EEG data, which utilizes both vector and functional principal components analysis while simultaneously adjusting for covariate-dependent heteroscedasticity. CA-HPCA assumes the covariance process is weakly separable conditional on observed covariates, allowing for covariate-adjustments to be made on the marginal covariances rather than the full covariance leading to stable and computationally efficient estimation. A mixed effects framework is proposed to estimate the model components coupled with a bootstrap test for group-level inference. The proposed methodology provides novel insights into neurodevelopmental differences between TD and ASD children.",

            "text": "Despite the numerous developmental delays observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to their typically developing peers (TD), the neural mechanisms underpinning these delays are not well characterized. To address this gap, our motivating study collected resting-state electroencephalograms (EEG) on TD and ASD children aged two to twelve years old, making it possible to contrast neural processes between the two diagnostic groups over a wide developmental range. EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) characterize cortical and intracortical brain activity, respectively, via the measurement of electrical potentials and their corresponding oscillatory dynamics (i.e. spectral characteristics). Recent studies in cognitive development using both EEG and MEG highlight the peak alpha frequency (PAF), defined as the location of a single prominent peak in the spectral density within the alpha frequency band (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , as a potential biomarker associated with autism diagnosis [7] [8] [9] . Specifically, the location of the PAF tends to shift from lower to higher frequencies as TD children age but this chronological shift is notably delayed or absent in ASD children [7, 8, 12, 16] . This trend is observed in our motivating data from a temporal electrode (T8) where the PAF, identifiable as 'humps' in age-specific slices of the group-specific bivariate mean spectral density (across age and frequency), increases in frequency with age for TD children but not for ASD children ( Fig. 1(a) ). Although the PAF holds promise as a biomarker for neural development in TD and ASD children, emphasis on the identification of a single peak produces considerable drawbacks. Estimation of a subject-electrode specific PAF can be error prone due to the presence of noise and multiple local maxima [6] and measurement of PAF inherently reduces the information from the alpha spectral band to a single scalar summary resulting in a loss of information. To avoid these limitations, we follow Scheffler et al. [15] and consider the entire spectral density across the alpha band as a functional measurement of neural activity. We focus on modeling and contrasting patterns of alpha spectral variation regionally across the scalp and chronologically across development for both the ASD and TD diagnostic groups. While Scheffler et al. [14] proposed a hybrid principal components analysis (HPCA) decomposition that models variation in regionreferenced functional EEG data, it does not allow for the covariance structure to change across development as needed in our application. Previous research clearly shows that alpha spectral dynamics differ as a function of age between TD and ASD children and to assume a constant covariance structure across development risks missing important findings. To avoid this misspecification, we propose a covariate-adjusted hybrid principal components analysis (CA-HPCA) that models variation in high-dimensional functional data while simultaneously allowing the patterns of variation to change as a function of subject-specific covariates. CA-HPCA assumes the covariance process is weakly separable conditional on observed covariates, allowing for covariate-adjustments to be made on the marginal covariances rather than the full covariance leading to stable and computationally efficient estimation.",

In the former class, Cardot [2] proposed a non-parametric covariate-adjusted functional principal components analysis (FPCA) in the context of dense functional data and Jiang and Wang [10] extended covariate-adjusted FPCA to noisy or sparse settings by estimating subject-specific scores using conditional expectation. In both cases, covariance estimation is performed non-parametrically by simultaneous smoothing across the covariate and functional domains via kernel methods. By fixing eigenfunctions across the covariate domain, Chio et al. [5] introduced a semi-parametric functional regression model that estimates covariate-dependent principal scores using a single-index model and Backenroth et al. [1] developed a heteroscedastic FPCA for repeatedly measured curves that models eigenvalues as an exponential function of covariate and subject-dependent effects.",

We briefly explore the methodological contributions of our proposed model and the resulting computational gains. A central theme in FPCA decompositions for multi-dimensional functional data is the use of simplifying assumptions regarding the covariance structure to ease estimation. A flexible approach in modeling two-dimensional functional data is to assume weak separability of the covariance process [4, 11] in which the marginal covariances along each dimension are targeted and the full covariance is projected onto a tensor basis formed from the corresponding marginal eigenfunctions. Thus, estimation is reduced from that of the total covariance in four-dimensions to the marginal covariances in twodimensions for which efficient two-dimensional smoothers exist. Scheffler et al. [14] extended weak separability to region-referenced functional EEG data (similar to our motivating study) by allowing a discrete regional dimension via HPCA. We leverage the simplifying assumptions and computational efficiency of HPCA through the proposed CA-HPCA which introduces covariate-dependence to the marginal covariances rather than the total covariance and allows the marginal eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to change across the covariate domain.",

Previous methods such as Cardot [2] and Jiang and Wang [10] utilized kernel methods to estimate covariate-dependent marginal covariances but these approaches are computationally intensive and scale poorly with the introduction of additional covariates. To address this challenge, we extend the fast functional covariance smoothing proposed by Cederbaum et al. [3] to allow for covariate-adjustments by including an additional basis along the covariate dimension. Thus, CA-HPCA generalizes covariate-adjustments to high-dimensional functional covariances and substantially reduces the resulting computational burden by applying adjustments to the marginal covariances and introducing covariate-dependence to cutting-edge fast covariance smoothers. A mixed effects framework is proposed to estimate the model components and is paired with parametric bootstrap resampling to perform inference across the covariate domain. The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed CA-HPCA and Sect. 3 describes the corresponding estimation procedure. Application of the proposed method to our resting state EEG data follows in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes with a brief summary and discussion.",

Note that weak separability is more flexible than strong separability (i.e. separability) commonly utilized in spatiotemporal modeling which requires the total covariance, not just the directions of variation, is the same up to a constant for fixed slices of the other dimensions. Unlike previously applications of weak separability, we assume that the total covariance is weakly separable conditional on observed covariates and the marginal covariance functions vary smoothly along the covariate domain.

Alpha spectral density (\u03a9 = (6 Hz, 14 Hz)) estimates for each electrode were obtained and the resulting electrode-specific alpha spectral estimates form an instance of regionreferenced functional data.",

While the main focus of our analysis is to characterize differences in alpha spectral dynamics between TD and ASD children over the course of development via inference on the group-region mean functions, we begin by briefly discussing the eigencomponents produced by the decomposition. The leading four; four and four; six covariate-adjusted regional and functional marginal eigencomponents are collectively found to explain 1.006 and 0.895 of the total FVE (F V E dG d ) in the TD and ASD groups, respectively. In the functional dimension along the covariate domain, the first least leading covariate-adjusted marginal eigenfunctions \u03c6 d1 (a, \u03c9) ( Fig. 2(a) , top row) display maximal variation at approximately 6 and 10 Hz (in opposing directions), where the location of maximal variation shifts in TD children from higher to lower frequencies as age increases but remains relatively constant in ASD children. The second leading covariate-adjusted marginal eigenfunctions \u03c6 d2 (a, \u03c9) ( Fig. 2(a) , bottom row) show maximal variation at 6 Hz, 8.5 Hz, 10.5 Hz and 6 Hz, 7.5 Hz in the TD and ASD groups, respectively, where again peak variation moves from higher to lower frequencies as age increases in the TD group but not the ASD group which instead displays shifts in the magnitude of maximal variation across development. The first two leading covariate-adjusted marginal eigenfunctions together explain at least 65% of the variation in the covariate-adjusted functional marginal covariances. In the regional dimension along the covariate domain, the first leading covariate-adjusted marginal eigenvectors v d1 (a, r) ( Fig. 2(b) , top row) display maximal variation in the central; right temporal; left posterior and central; middle posterior electrodes at younger ages with a shift to right posterior and frontal; right temporal electrodes at older ages in the TD and ASD groups, respectively. The second leading covariate-adjusted marginal eigenvector v d2 (a, r) ( Fig. 2(b) , bottom row) shows maximal variation in the frontal and right frontal; right temporal electrodes at younger ages which moves to frontal; right posterior (opposing directions) and central; left posterior (opposing directions) at older ages in the TD and ASD groups, respectively. The first two covariate-adjusted marginal eigenvectors together explain at least 70% of the variation in the covariate-adjusted regional marginal covariances.",

Nearly all electrodes show significant differences between diagnostic groups in the alpha spectrum at some point over development (with the exception of the P3 and P7 electrodes) with the strongest group differences occurring at younger ages (30-50 months) and older ages (100-130 months) in the frontal, central, temporal, and posterior regions.",

At both electrodes, the TD group displays a well-defined peak in the alpha spectrum that shifts from 8 Hz-10 Hz moving from 50-110 months, whereas the ASD group generally has less clearly-defined peaks that tend to center around 9 Hz throughout development. Differences in the estimated group-region mean functions mirror the results found from the parametric bootstrap procedure with separation of the point-wise confidence intervals occurring at 50; 90; 110 months and 110 months for the T8 and T10 electrodes, respectively. When aggregated, the observations and inferences obtained from the CA-HPCA model components provide evidence for differences in both the mean structure and patterns of covariation between the two diagnostic groups that shift and change over development highlighting the need to provide covariate-adjustments in modeling the high-dimensional EEG data.

The proposed estimation procedure develops computationally efficient fast-covariance smoothers that incorporate covariate-dependence when estimating marginal covariances as well as a mixed effects framework which admits inference along the covariate-domain via bootstrap sampling. The CA-HPCA decomposition was developed to model EEG data over a broad developmental range but may be applied to other settings where high-dimensional data is expected to exhibit differential covariation as a function heterogenous covariates.",
