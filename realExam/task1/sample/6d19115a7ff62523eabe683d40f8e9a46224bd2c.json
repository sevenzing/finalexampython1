Because these numbers exceed the maximum capacity of available intensive care units (ICU), patients are asked to stay at home until advanced respiratory impairment, thus increasing the lethality of COVID-19 [4] . In shortage of ICU beds, treating patients at risk of developing hyper-inflammatory ARDS in outpatient settings becomes, therefore, imperative in order to impact disease course and to relieve the pressure on hospitals' structures. Yet, in the absence of effective antiviral therapies and reliable predictors of negative disease progression, this neglected category of patients can rely only on supportive measures while awaiting for clinical deterioration and transportation to emergency departments.",

Colchicine was started after a median of 8 days (range 6-13) from COVID-19 onset and after 3 to 5 days of spiking fever despite acetaminophen or antibiotic treatment. As shown in Figure 1 , colchicine led to defervescence within 72 hours in all patients. Only one patient was hospitalized because of persisting dyspnea and discharged after four days of low-flow oxygen therapy. Colchicine was in general well tolerated. Two patients reported a mild diarrhea that did not interfere with the completion of the treatment.",

Its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties has been known since ancient times, and colchicine is now approved to treat autoinflammatory conditions such as gout, familiar Mediterranean fever, and pericarditis [5] . In the present study, colchicine was used offlabel based on its capability to interfere with pathogenic mechanisms implicated in COVID-19 related hyper-inflammation, including inflammasome activation and cytokines release [2] [3] 5 ]. In addition, by interfering with the polymerization of microtubules, colchicine inhibits the chemotaxis of monocytes and neutrophils, cells that have been abundantly found in the lungs of COVID-19 patients [1] [2] [3] 6] . Our hypothesis-driven experience supports the use of colchicine in outpatient settings to intercept rampant \"cytokine storm\" in a subset of patients with hyperinflammatory phenotype clinically characterized by persistent high fever.",

Large randomized controlled trials in both inpatient and outpatient settings will definitively confirm the utility of colchicine in the current and future COVID-19 outbreaks. ",
