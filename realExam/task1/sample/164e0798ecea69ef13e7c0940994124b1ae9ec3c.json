At the time of this writing (February 27, 2020), the initial epidemic in China is threatening to transform into a pandemic, with a surge of cases in Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Through terrific work by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health officials across the country, we have been able to limit the number of cases in the United States. But if COVID-19 expands worldwide, it seems inevitable that at least some hospitals in the United States will see a surge of patients with the virus.",

Remember also that some patients infected with COVID-19 will present with atypical symptoms (such as nausea, diarrhea, or abdominal pain). 1 Patients who have recently visited a region where cases have been confirmed with symptoms whose etiology remains unknown should still be evaluated for COVID-19 even if they do not have respiratory symptoms.",

Specifically, IC.01.06.01 states: \"The hospital prepares to respond to an influx of potentially infectious patients.\" Based on the recent spread of COVID-19 and the increasing chance that we will see more cases in the United States, we recommend that hospitals review their plans, assess whether they can rapidly and reliably implement their plans as designed, and modify their plans if needed based on their assessment. We recently published a report on conversion of a conference room into a low-acuity inpatient medical unit to respond to an influenza outbreak, and this may be a model for some hospitals. 2 If there are severe outbreaks, some communities may even want to consider creating surge hospitals. 3 Surge hospitals, so-called because they are designed to treat a surge in the number of patients needing care, contain triage, treatment, and sometimes even surgical capabilities. These temporary facilities were originally established to deal with community-wide events (such as hurricanes) and meant to serve as a stopgap measure to provide medical care until the area's health care organizations could reopen. However, surge hospitals could have a role in pandemics if all hospitals in a community are overwhelmed despite activating their internal surge plans.",
