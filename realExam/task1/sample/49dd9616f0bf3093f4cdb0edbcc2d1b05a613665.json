These groups are not automatic due to [9, Theorems 8.2.8 and 8.1.3] . To include all fundamental groups of closed 3-manifolds, the class of automatic groups had been extended by Bridson and Gilman [5] , Baumslag, Shapiro and Short [1] ; see also autostackable groups proposed by Brittenham, Hermiller and Holt [7] .

Despite the generality of the notion of Cayley automatic groups which retains only computational mechanism of automatic groups, it is possible to partly answer this question for some Cayley automatic groups in terms of a certain numerical characteristic which is intimately related to the Dehn function. We discuss it in more details in the end of this section. In the following few paragraphs we briefly recall the notion of Cayley automatic groups and representations, and a standard way to construct such representations for semidirect products Z n A Z.

Let \u03b3 = [g] \u223c for some g \u2208 Z[x], g \u223c 0, and L \u03b3 = \u03c8 \u22121 p,q ( \u03b3 ). We have: L \u03be = {w \u2208 Dom p,q | \u03d5 g (w) \u2208 L \u03b3 }. To prove the inclusion {w \u2208 Dom p,q | \u03d5 g (w) \u2208 L \u03b3 } \u2286 L \u03be we notice that if \u03c8 p,q (w) = [sx + r] \u223c , then \u03d5 g (w) = [g(sx + r)] \u223c which is equal to [gk] \u223c for some k \u2208 Z iff the polynomial t divides g(sx + r \u2212 k). Since t is irreducible and t does not divide g, then s = 0 and r = k. Therefore, by Proposition 3, if L \u03b3 is regular, then L \u03be is regular. So, L \u03b3 is not regular. Also, if t is irreducible, every nonzero endomorphism of Z 2 with nontrivial kernel is not FA-recognizable. Now, let n > 2 and t(x) = x n + p n\u22121 x + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + p 1 x \u2212 q be a polynomial with integers coefficients for which 1 + |p n\u22121 | + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + |p 1 | < |q|. We identify the group Z n with the additive group of the ring Z[x]/ t . We denote by p a tuple p = p 1 , . . . , p n\u22121 . Clearly, one gets a representation \u03c8 p,q : Dom p,q \u2192 Z n , in exactly the same way as it is described for the case n = 2. It can be seen that all arguments presented in this section hold valid up to the following minor modifications. For an algorithm recognizing the equivalence \u223c, one should use n carries r 0 , r 1 , . . . , r n\u22121 updated as follows:",

We recall that the Heisenberg group H 3 (Z) is isomorphic to Z 2 T Z for some lower triangular matrix T , see Remark 12. The result of [4, Theorem 5.1] shows that if a Cayley automatic representation of the Heisenberg group \u03c8 : L \u2192 H 3 (Z) satisfies certain conditions, then the function h is bounded from below by the exponential function e(n) = exp(n).

The fundamental solution can be found, for example, using continued fraction of \u221a n. All solutions of negative Pell's equation x 2 \u2212 ny 2 = \u22121 are also generated from its fundamental solution. However, solutions of negative Pell's equation do not always exist. The first 54 numbers for which solutions exist are given by the sequence A031396 in OEIS [15] . Similarly, for the Pell-type equations c 2 \u2212 na 2 = 4 and c 2 \u2212 na 2 = \u22124, all solutions are recursively generated from the fundamental solutions. For the latter equation solutions exist if and",
