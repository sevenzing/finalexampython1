I replied \"I hear you, let's figure out how much you can afford.\" They replied \"I can afford a monthly payment of about what I am paying in rent\". I then asked \"How much have you saved up for the down payment?\" The answer was a figure far lower than one might have hoped. I said \"There are 5 variables: the house price, down payment, interest rate and mortgage term which then determine your monthly payment\". This function is available on spreadsheet programs, typically called \"PMT\", as well as on numerous websites.",

I further went on to say that in the short-term, it costs more to own the same property you rent. I started to go into mortgage insurance that might be required for buyers with a proportionally low down payment, real estate taxes, home insurance, not to mention the need for an emergency fund for home repairs -but the person became visibly depressed.",

As noted in a previous article, 4 the primary efficacy measure for some treatments is the proportion of patients responding (\"categorical\"), and for others is a mean sign or symptom (\"continuous\"). For example, how big would a study have to be to detect a difference between a cyclosporine product and vehicle of the magnitude of the cyclosporine products approved in the U.S., (5% in the vehicle group, and 15% in the active), it would have to have 141 patients per group. The sample size for this categorical analysis also depends upon the efficacy rate in the vehicle group. So if the vehicle group had a higher rate of responding (40%), in order to detect the same treatment effect (15%), then the sample size would be larger -173 patients per group (Table 1) .",

A key step is to define the limits of equality. As I wrote in a previous column in this journal, 5 this is called the non-inferiority margin. In the glaucoma example above, the non-inferiority margin in the 1980's and 1990's was 2 mm Hg. 1 Today, it is 1 to 1.5 mm Hg. 6 As I write this column, I am aware of only a few controlled studies of two active pharmacotherapies in dry eye. One is Downie et al, in which two formulations of an over-the-counter lubricant were compared. In this study of ~120 subjects per group, the authors found a difference in staining of 1.6 units (SD of 5-6) on a 0-30 scale, which was statistically significant. They interpreted it to be clinically significant. 7 This interpretation is one which will require further discussion in the ocular surface community.",
