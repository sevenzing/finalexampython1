Their use is followed by routine phenotypic and biochemical evaluation of propagated bacteria and yeast to provide microbial identification (1, 2 ) . Reduction of analysis time would be advantageous, especially for organisms that are fastidious, slow-growing, nonculturable, or occur in polymicrobial infections.

Three of these 6 false-negative samples were due to the presence of Eubacterium lentum as identified by the reference standard method, an identification that was missed each time this organism was presented. E. lentum is environmental in origin and is not commonly isolated from blood culture, thus this result demonstrates another opportunity for database adjustment to ensure identification of this organism in future samples. PCR-ESI/MS demonstrated several instances in which false negatives were seen in a mixture, where 1 organism was correctly identified, as in samples 89, 124, 135, 200, 228, and 271. As discussed in a previous report (14 ) , an error can occur when combinations of staphylococci and streptococci, or staphylococci and enterococci are present. In these situations, 1 organism is preferentially identified. Other missed identifications were possibly due to large differences in bacterial load, such that only 1 of the 2 organisms is detected in the PCR. Additional false negatives with primary ID in samples 223, 242, and 1272 were likely due to large differences in organism burden, resulting in 1 organism being missed in the identification. False-positive results were observed when a second organism was correctly identified (false positive with primary ID) can be split into 2 groups. The first group contains samples 76, 302, and 1647, in which the second identification is due to an incompletely populated database for Pantoea sp. and Hemophilus influenzae, resulting in a mixed identification. In addition, discordance on both the genus and species levels was seen for Pantoea sp. in samples 1033 and 1050, in which the PCR-ESI/MS identification was Citrobacter braakii. This identification is very genetically similar, because both organisms belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which could be resolved in the future by populating the database with isolates from this family. The remaining group, including samples 276, 309, 323, 341, 482, 1499, and 2889, all contained an organism that was identified by PCR-ESI/MS, but at a significantly lower confidence level than the primary identification. Because PCR-ESI/MS is a DNA-based technique, it is possible to detect organisms that are nonviable by culture or represent DNA contamination. These identifications may be true positives based on DNA present, or may be true false positives in mixture. Discordance was also observed in samples 30, 202, and 2997, and the organisms in each sample were misidentified as genetically similar, possibly because of low copy numbers that resulted in incomplete profiles for identification. a Method 1 considers \"false positives with primary ID\" and \"false negatives with primary ID\" as concordant, because at least 1 organism was correctly identified. b Method 2 considers \"false positives with primary ID\" as false positives and \"false negatives with primary ID\" as false negatives. Although both techniques show similar performance, there are several findings of merit that must be considered in the comparison. Although the resulting identification of a microorganism is the same regardless of the technique used, the information required to come to these data is very different for each technique. PCR-ESI/MS uses genetic information whereas MALDI-TOF/MS uses proteomic information to identify organisms present; this difference highlights the varying utilities of each instrument. Genetic identification allows for discrimination down to the representative strain type of each organism during routine work, detects silent mutations, and allows access to antibiotic resistance genes, providing a mechanism for rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing. Proteomic information however, in many instances discriminates down to species-level functioning to provide organism identification. Although several studies have been performed using MALDI-TOF/MS to discriminate clonal/strain types (32) (33) (34) , this procedure is not performed routinely and would not be applied if used for highthroughput clinical identification. PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS show similar performance for routine use, but PCR-ESI/MS offers extended utility for epidemiology and infection control. Furthermore, utilizing genetic information offers the potential for identifying uncultivatable organisms.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 752, "end": 757, "text": "(14 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 4021, "end": 4025, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 4026, "end": 4030, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4031, "end": 4035, "text": "(34)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "An additional aspect that should be considered regarding these methods is the time to result. PCR-ESI/MS requires approximately 4 -6 h from the time of blood culture positivity, and can resolve mixtures in 1 assay, but this method requires the batching of 6 samples at a time, and may allow direct analysis on whole blood, removing the requirement for blood culture. Conversely, MALDI-TOF/MS currently requires subculture before identification. The time required for this step varies from an additional 12 h from positivity up to and beyond 72 h (35 ) , depending on the organism. MALDI-TOF/MS does not require batching, although owing to the subculture requirement, a batched format may be more convenient. Several recent reports have described the use of MALDI-TOF/MS for identification of microorganisms without subculture (23, 24, 36, 37 ) , and the recently released Sepsityper by Bruker Daltonics (www.bdal.com) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the time to identification. In these studies results have shown successful identification for approximately 80% of blood cultures and therefore demonstrate that more developmental work is required to increase this identification rate before clinical implementation. Although PCR-ESI/MS is currently the faster technique for microorganism identification, recently described MALDI-TOF/MS methods may soon reduce the time to identification to less than an hour from blood culture positivity. The identification times observed for these 2 MS techniques offer a stark comparison to current reports of requirements of approximately 40 h for identification with gold standard methods (38 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 546, "end": 551, "text": "(35 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 826, "end": 830, "text": "(23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 835, "end": 838, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 839, "end": 843, "text": "37 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1641, "text": "(38 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The costs of these 2 techniques also differ substantially. Both require the purchase of a dedicated mass spectrometer and software package at a cost that can be considered equivalent for the purposes of this discussion, despite the expected differences in the overall costs of each method. However, the day-to-day cost for consumables greatly varies. PCR-ESI/MS requires DNA extraction and a kit that contains reagents necessary for a PCR, including buffers, enzyme, and primers, resulting in a cost of $50 to $100 per sample, which is comparable to the cost of existing molecular assays. Alternatively, MALDI-TOF/MS requires only media to culture the organism, \u03fd1 g matrix, and tips, the cost of which is approximately $3 to $7 per sample.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the results of this study, overall, demonstrate that both PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS show high diagnostic accuracy compared to biochemical and phenotypic identification as the reference standard used in the clinical laboratory.
