The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broken out in 2003, which has longer latency and stronger infectivity. This has led to severe shortages of medical resources and infections of health care workers.

Among the 1716 cases, 1502 cases were in Hubei Province, and 1102 cases in Wuhan City. Wuhan Tongji Hospital in Hubei is the largest Grade-A Tertiary Hospital, which provided the most beds during the battle against the epidemic. This study analyzed the 54 medical staff infections in Tongji Hospital from 7 January to 11 February 2020, including 2 cases (3.7%) from first-line departments, 39 cases (72.2%) from non-first-line departments, 10 (18.5%) from medical medical technology departments, and 3 (5.6%) from administrative and logistics departments. Such pattern of distribution was similar to that reported by Wang et al 2 on 7 February 2020, which indicated that among the 40 medical staff infections, 31 (77.5%) worked in general wards, 7 (17.5%) in emergency room, and 2 (5%) in intensive care unit. Analysis of onset time suggested that earliest infections occurred in the emergency department, which began to show symptoms on 7 January 2020, and the other cases showed symptoms mostly from 22 January to 3 February 2020, then from 4 February on, number of new cases gradually decreased. The causes of such pattern of medical staff infection may include: firstly, the COVID-19 has many atypical clinical manifestations, so the patients may go to different departments for treatment. As the disease may be contagious during the incubation period, 5,6 many medical staff are not adequately protected and become infected via unwitting contact with the patients. Second, it is important to note there were not sufficient reserves of protective equipment in the hospital for a pandemic of such severity. The protective equipment, such as protective clothing, N95 masks, and goggles are prioritized to first-line medical staff in fever clinics and fever wards, while other staff often have only surgical masks at best, which explains the lower infection rates in medical staff directly facing the infected than medical staff who are less exposed. Third, according to the article by Wang et al 2 on 7 February 2020, among the 138 cases admitted by Wuhan Zhongnan Hospital, 17 cases (12.3%) were hospitalized for reasons other than pneumonia, such as conditions that requires surgery and tumors, including 7 cases in the surgery department, 5 cases in the internal medicine department, and 5 cases in the oncology department. These cases may even have been infected during hospitalization. As patients in hospital frequently contact inpatient caregivers and visitors that frequently go in and out of hospital and are at high risk of getting infected, which exacerbates infections of medical staff not in direct contact with the known infected patients. Fourth, the infected medical staff may be asymptomatic but infectious, which may lead to clustered infection in a department. 7 Another notable feature of the medical staff infections by COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital, was the high rate of severe and critical cases. The 54 cases included 40 severe cases and 3 critical cases (79% in total), a ratio much higher than what's reported on the N Engl J MED by Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, 8 in which only 32% of the 41 hospitalized patients were severe or critical cases. Another unusual feature of the 54 cases was that the 11 common cases were 47 years old on average, while the 43 severe and critical cases were 38 years old on average-the common-type cases were significantly elder than the severe or critical cases, which was contrary to what's reported by Huang et al and Wang et al 1 Such contradiction may be explained by (a) the lower ratio of elder people among the medical staff; (b) the longer work time and higher work intensity of the medical staff aged 38 years or so, as they are the mainstay of a hospital. However, the latter is currently only based on empirical assumption and not supported by quantitative analysis.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "nonemergency Clinics/wards (other clinical department), medical technology departments (examination and testing departments), and others (administrative logistics departments) according to their work sections. Two of the 54 medical staff (from the medical technology department and other departments respectively) have a history of close contact with the staff outside the hospital, and the remaining 52 staff have no history of contact with the staff outside the hospital. We all know that new coronary pneumonia is highly contagious, and medical staff have more opportunities to closely contact patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Therefore, medical staff at Tongji Hospital have been arranged to live in designated hotels and have no chance to be with other staff. A retrospective single center case series of 54 inpatients were recruited from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China.

It is worthwhile to further explore the mechanism of this phenomenon, which ca make us identify the severe and critical cases in medical staff. In Hubei, the epicenter, many patients had positive CT images but showed negative results in the nucleic acid test.11 To better address such patients, on 13 February 2020, theGeneral Office of the National Health Commission and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued the guideline \"Clinical Diagnosis of COVID-19 (Fifth Edition on trial),\" 4 which added \"clinical diagnosed\" to the classification of the new coronavirusinfected pneumonia. The \"clinical diagnosed\" classification refers to cases that had characteristic clinical manifestations of infection butwere negative in the nucleic acid test. We compared the nucleic acidpositive and -negative cases, and found that the two groups showed no significant differences in age, gender, or symptoms, but the former had a higher ratio of patchy shadows on CT images than the latter (19/36, 52.8% vs 3/16, 18.8%). As most of the patients are still hospitalized at the time of submission, we can hardly evaluate the significance of nucleic acid test results in prognosis, which require further observation of the natural history of the disease.Basing on these analyses, we suggest training for all hospital staffto prevent infection, especially those in departments not so alert about virus infection as those directly facing patients in fever; and preparation of sufficient protection and disinfection materials. For patients who are currently hospitalized due to other diseases, chest CT and/or nucleic acid tests should be performed as soon as possible in case of fever or respiratory symptoms, and if the diagnosis is positive in either CT or nucleic acid test, the patient must be transferred to designated hospitals immediately for further treatment. Medical staff of 38 years old or so shall receive extra care and protection due to their susceptibility to severe infection, and when a medical personal is infected, changes in right lung and upper right lobe should be noticed for earlier detection of severe cases.
