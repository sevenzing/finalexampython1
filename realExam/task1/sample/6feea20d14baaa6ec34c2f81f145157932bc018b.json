According to the current statistics of the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the disease has involved all over the world, with over 1362000 diagnosed cases and more than 76000 deaths until April 7, 2020 3 . In the initial phases of the disease, symptoms like fever, cough, and dyspnea can occur 2, 4 . Some patients rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and additional severe complications, which are ultimately followed by multiple organ failure 5 , hence, timely diagnosis of patients is very essential. Although detection of viral nucleic acid using real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard of diagnosis and monitoring, it is very time-consuming and has a high prevalence of false-negative results 6, 7 .",

Although laboratory data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected neonates are still limited, there are several case reports that provide some laboratory findings. In a 6month-old male neonate with confirmed COVID-19 infection, with no clinical signs or symptoms and high viral load, WBC count and biochemical markers including liver function tests were normal on day 2 and only neutropenia occurred on day 8 of admission 17 . This asymptomatic neonate with normal laboratory results may play significant roles in the transmission of COVID-19 in the community. Another infected infant with no significant signs of the disease revealed different results. Blood tests showed lymphopenia, elevated liver function tests and elevated CK level 18 . A 55-day-old female infant with only rhinorrhoea and a dry cough without fever or other significant symptoms was confirmed to have COVID-19. Laboratory tests results indicated that there were changes in hepatic function tests. Lymphocyte count, platelet count, liver function tests, procalcitonin, and serum IgM level were all slightly elevated. Other laboratory examinations including CRP, ESR, coagulation tests, hemoglobin, D-dimer and renal function tests showed no abnormalities 16 . Laboratory examination of a 3-month-old female infected with COVID-19, suffering from diarrhea and fever with normal chest computerized tomography (CT) scan results, revealed high neutrophil levels and reduced lymphocytes 19 . Although all the described cases were asymptomatic or with mild clinical manifestations, their laboratory results were very different and conflicting. For example, lymphocyte counts varied from lymphopenia to lymphocytosis and CRP was normal among neonates (Table 1) . These findings highlight the difficulties in detecting the disease and making decisions in neonates based on symptoms and laboratory results.",

Wei et al. claimed that procalcitonin elevation was common in pediatric patients which is different from adults. The procalcitonin was elevated in 80% cases in this study which is not common in adult patients 23 . Procalcitonin is a marker for bacterial infection and can be induced by bacteriotoxins but suppressed by interferons. It may suggest that routine antibacterial treatments may be effective in pediatric patients 23 . Based on Wei et al. report and since WBC count results are very conflicting and CRP is usually normal in children, procalcitonin may be a good diagnostic marker to detect COVID-19 in children. Nevertheless, procalcitonin was reported to be elevated in only 3% of all children cases reported by Wang et al. 24 . While laboratory data of infected children is limited and less than adults, normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin elevation are the most important laboratory reports of COVID-19 infected children (Table 1) .",

We showed that the laboratory findings of COVID-19 confirmed pneumonia patients were very different and conflicting, however, some tests are attracting more attention. Laboratory results of neonates were very different and conflicting regardless of clinical symptoms, and CRP was normal in the cases compared to other age categories though. Normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin elevation are the most important laboratory reports of COVID-19 infected children. With respect to adult patients, lymphopenia and elevated LDH were more common. Lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH were markers that should be considered more in elderly people.

            "text": "infected pregnant women are atypical in comparison with the non-pregnant adults. The leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio were reported to more common in the COVID-19 infected pregnant women in the Liu et al study33 . However, there was no significant difference regarding lymphopenia among pregnant and non-pregnant groups. CRP elevation is obvious in most of the cases33 . In the study of Wang et al., laboratory findings included high leukocyte count, elevated neutrophil ratio, lymphopenia, and elevated CRP, D-dimer, and LDH. However, aminotransferase levels and creatinine were reported in a normal range 34 . Moreover, LIU et al. reported that leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio, elevated CRP and interleukin 6, and low albumin are the main laboratory findings of pregnant women, while the normal amount of ALT, AST, ferritin, and ESR were reported 35 . Chen et al. reported that among nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, 55% had lymphopenia. 66% had elevated concentrations of CRP and 33% had increased concentrations of ALT and AST. Additionally, inconsistent with other reports indicated leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio, 77% of patients had a normal WBC count 31 . It seems that high CRP, leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio are the most reliable markers of COVID-19 among pregnant women and other laboratory tests are All rights reserved.
