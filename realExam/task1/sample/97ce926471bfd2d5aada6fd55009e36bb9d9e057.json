Although tissue culture techniques were introduced in diagnostic virology, their application was generally limited to a few large public health laboratories. However, with the development of newer simpler and rapid methods, the science is changing. This reflects evolving technology and differing priorities in various health-care settings. As the science pf antiviral chemotherapy advances, it is likely that priorities will come into a better focus and that hospitals will move toward a more standardized approach to viral illness and diagnostic laboratories.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sami Al-Hajjar"}, {"text": "There are a number of clinical situations where viral diagnosis may be particularly helpful.

Cytopathic effect (CPE) is a pattern of cell destruction resulting from viral infection that occurs in a characteristic pattern depending on the cell line and infecting virus. Members of the orthomyxovirus (influenza virus) and paramyxovirus (parainfluenza virus, or mumps) groups may fail to produce a clear-cut CPE in infected cell cultures, but they may be detected first, or sometimes exclusively, by demonstration of the phenomenon of hemabsorption (these viruses produce hemagglutinin molecules that protrude from the lipid bilayer of the . A recent advance in a viral culture methodology involves centrifugation of the patient specimens onto cell monolayers in the bottom of glass shell vials, and, after a 1-to-2-day period of cultivation, staining for viral antigen in the cells by using a labeled monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The centrifugation step shortens the time of development of viral antigen or CPE. The monoclonal antibody, if directed at viral antigens produced early in the replication cycle, can detect a virus even before the development of CPE. For example, use of the ''shell vial'' technique in the laboratory enables detection of 50-60% of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive specimens within 24 h and a cumulative total of 90% within 48 h. The remaining 10% are detected by traditional viral CPE and require a mean of 10 days for positive results.

Clinical specimens are applied to a slide, dried, fixed, and stained. A fluorescence microscope is used to read the slides for either fluorescing organisms or infected cells.

These assays can be automated.

PCR is a powerful new technique developed in 1985 and is an alternative to direct hybridization methods. It can be used to amplify a small piece of viral DNA or RNA in clinical specimens up to a millionfold, allowing detection of small quantities of infectious agent in a single sample. PCR has the sensitivity to detect as few as ten infected cells or one virus in as many as one million cells in clinical specimens. Because PCR is very sensitive, slight contamination of laboratory specimens by stray DNA can lead to amplification of DNA not in the original specimen. It is being used currently to detect HIV, herpesviruses, influenza virus, hepatitis viruses, rotavirus, EBV, CMV, and parvovirus. The use of PCR for the diagnosis of CNS disease has been well evaluated for HSV encephalitis and enterovirus meningitis. The use of this highly sensitive technique has increased our understanding of the etiological role of viruses in CNS disease. For example, it has been demonstrated that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV type 2 (HSV-2) can cause meningitic symptoms without causing concurrent skin lesions. Multiplex PCR is a newer diagnostic technology that allows testing for multiple viruses simultaneously with a very high specificity and sensitivity. The xTAG RVP assay (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics; Toronto, ON, Canada) is one example and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This test detects 12 different viruses and has a sensitivity of 96.4% and a specificity of 95.9%.

Besides providing prognostic information on individual cases, particularly for HIV and human CMV, genome quantification plays a most important role in monitoring the patient's response to antiviral treatment. VL testing assesses the success of antiviral therapy, including, but unable to distinguish between, different factors involved. These include treatment failure due to viral (development of antiviral resistance) and host factors (one of which is noncompliance). Several studies have proven the value of VL determination as a surrogate marker for clinical markers of therapeutic success. The increasing availability and clinical use of potent anti-(retro)viral chemotherapy has sparked the development of a variety of commercial assays for viral genome quantification.
