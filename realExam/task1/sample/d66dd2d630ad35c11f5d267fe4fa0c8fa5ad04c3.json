Wilson (1998) noted a growing consilience (interlocking of causal explanations across disciplines) in which the \"interfaces between disciplines become as important as the disciplines themselves\" that would \"touch the borders of the social sciences and humanities\". Thus, the key problem that will be addressed in this book is the complex linkage between anthropogenically induced changes in the climate system and their societal outcome as multiple forms of conflicts that sometimes lead to violence or societal instability, and how the latter can be managed, prevented, or avoided. To this end, reactive or proactive political strategies, policies, and measures can address the cause by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and can address the impacts by political adaptation and mitigation measures to avoid an escalation into violent conflicts.",

In earth history and human history, a fundamental change has occurred since the Industrial Revolution (1750) and Watt's invention of the steam engine (1782) from the 'Holocene' to the 'Anthropocene'. This is due to increasing human interventions, especially the burning of fossil energy that has resulted in an anthropogenic period of climate change. The 'Anthropocene' is an informal geological-chronological term that refers to the global impact of human activities on the earth's ecosystems. The term was coined by the Nobel laureate in chemistry Paul Crutzen (2002 Crutzen ( , 2006 Crutzen ( , 2011 and by ecologist Eugene Stoermer (Crutzen/Stoermer 2000) , who argue that the influence of human behaviour on the Earth's atmosphere has constituted a new ecological era. According to Crutzen (2002) , the Anthropocene is \"a new geologic epoch in which [hu] mankind has emerged as a globally significantand potentially intelligent -force capable of reshaping the face of the planet\" (Clark/Crutzen/Schellnhuber 2004: 1; Ehlers/Krafft 2001 Ehlers 2008) . The 'Holocene' is a period of geological transition with dramatic environmental change, in particular major sea level rise resulting from the melting of the huge ice sheets covering large areas of the northern hemisphere. Bond, Kromer, Beer et al. (2001) postulated a 1,500-year cycle throughout the Holocene with an important contrast in hydrological circulation patterns. These changes in climate have had a major influence on the development and collapse of advanced civilizations (Fagan 2004; Diamond 2005; Bluemel 2009: 104) . The Roman Empire coincided with the 'Roman optimum' while its collapse occurred during a cooler period when massive migration of peoples occurred from Central Asia to Europe and from Northern Europe to the Mediterranean (Issar/Zohar 2004 : 14, 2007 : 12, 2009 . The next climatic downturn led to the \"little ice age\" (Fagan 2000 (Fagan , 2002 Zhang/Zhang/Lee et al. 2007 ",

Thus, the focus is primarily on conflict management but also on conflict prevention. \u2022 From the perspective of international security, many UN member states have emphasized in the General Assembly (UN 2009 ) and in the Security Council (UN 2007 (UN , 2011 ) the need to prevent climate change becoming a 'threat multiplier' that may trigger a violent escalation of the manifold existing conflicts by strengthening sustainability strategies, policies, and measures, and thus to strengthen efforts to minimize security threats, challenges, vulnerabilities, and risks. A major focus has been on preventing conflicts from escalating into violence triggered by the physical and societal impacts of climate change. \u2022 From the perspective of human security, the goal has been to avoid climate-induced violent conflicts occurring that would affect the livelihood of human beings, most particularly those with the highest degree of social vulnerability in the poorest countries who lack the capacities for proactive adaptation and mitigation and whose capacity for resilience is limited.",

Based on research into environmental conflict, the debate on the security implications of climate change began at the end of the 1980s. At the \"World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere -Implications for Global Security\" in June 1988 in Toronto, Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Prime Minister of Norway, said that \"the impact of world climate change may be greater than any challenge mankind has faced, with the exception of preventing nuclear war\". 11 Two research papers were published as early as 1989 (Brown 1989; Gleick 1989 ), but only a few publications addressed the issue during the 1990s (Swart 1996; van Ireland/ Klaassen/Nierop et al. 1996; Scheffran/Jathe 1996; Scheffran 1997 , Edwards 1999 Rahman 1999) .",

With regard to \"cooperation with third countries\" the paper calls for \"revisiting and reinforcing EU cooperation and political dialogue instruments, giving more attention to the impact of climate change on security\". The paper argued that \"this could lead to greater prioritization and enhanced support for climate change mitigation and adaptation, good governance, natural resource management, technology transfer, trans-boundary environmental cooperation \u2026, institutional strengthening and capacity building for crisis management\".

While Russia and China and many representatives of the Group of 77 (G-77) opposed the discussion of climate change as a security concern by the UN Security Council, a coalition of OECD countries, including all EU states, the USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Small Island States, stressed the need to address in the UNSC the linkage between climate change and its potential security implications from a proactive perspective. 23 This debate was prepared by a 'Concept Note' of 19 July Note' suggested that the reporting of the UN Secretary-General should take \"the security implications of climate change and its impact on resource availability into account in conflict analysis, mission planning and mission monitoring. The same applies to peacebuilding activities.\" To structure the debate in the UNSC, the 'Concept Note' referred to the special security implications of climate change caused by sea level rise and the food security nexus.",

No agreement exists in science and politics on the definitions, referent objects, scope, and boundaries, or on the policy goals and human security agendas. The human security concept has been proposed in scientific discourses as an alternative normative paradigm. In the social sciences, the concept has been widely discussed in development studies ( (Dannreuther 2007; Booth 2007) , where many realists have totally ignored this discourse (Kolodziej 2005) . Several proponents of a narrow human security concept (Mack 2004 (Mack , 2004a Krause 2004 Krause , 2004a Krause , 2008 ; Mac Farlane/Khong 2006; Black/Swatuck 2009) have opposed its horizontal widening to include other policy agendas of development and environment policy . The paradigmatic shift from 'national security' to 'human security' implies a change in the reference objects, the values to be protected, and the security dangers and concerns faced by individuals and humankind and that they have to cope with, as well as in policy agendas and strategies for achieving human security. Human security does not replace the national, regional, or international security of the world of states, but it shifts the focus from nation states to \"We the peoples of the United Nations\" as referred to in the Preamble of the UN Charter, from sovereignty to human well-being and survival, from the fixation with the 'other' (state, ethnic, or religious group) to 'us' as the cause (e.g. of global environmental change and global warming) and the victims of 'our own consumptive behaviour' (through an increase in the number and intensity of hydro-meteorological hazards).",

Oswald Spring (2001 ) has proposed a composite concept that links human with gender and environmental security (HUGE). 33 In the scientific discourse since the 1980s, even before the global turn, a few scholars had called for an expanded concept of international security (Westing 1986: 183-203 ) and for a comprehensive or human security approach (Westing 1993) . But the scientific human security discourse was triggered by the UNDP's (Eisen 2008) , and even in the health sciences (Leaning 2009 ). Alkire (2003: 15-39; 2003a; pointed to the many different definitions of human security as: \"a) safety from chronic threats such as hunger, disease and repression; b) protection from sudden and hurtful disruption in the patterns of daily life\". The CHS (2003) focused on threats from both poverty and violence and aimed \"to protect the vital core of all human lives in ways to enhance human freedoms and human fulfilment\", a goal that should be realized \"by joint strategies of protection and empowerment\".",

These hazards did not affect national and international security but they had severe impacts on the human security of human beings and the most affected communities and on their water, soil, food, health and livelihood security.

'Freedom from hazard impacts' calls for reducing the environmental and social vulnerability and enhancing the coping capabilities of societies confronted with environmental, geophysical, and climaterelated hazards. It implies that people can mobilize their resources to address sustainable development goals. Human security as 'freedom from hazard impacts' is achieved when people who are vulnerable to environmental hazards and disasters (Nathan 2009 ) that are often intensified by poverty, food insecurity, and improper housing in flood-prone and coastal ar-eas are better warned of impending hazards, and are protected against them and empowered to prepare themselves for them. Brauch argued that putting the environment and natural hazards on the human security agenda means addressing its impacts on water, soil, food, health, and livelihood security. Global environmental change as the outcome of the interaction between the earth and human systems and of direct human interference with nature has become a scientific, political, and security issue since the 1970s.

From a policy perspective, a holistic coping strategy requires better horizontal coordination of strategies, policies, and the measures carried out by ministries and international organizations. The best human security strategy for achieving 'freedom from hazard impacts' is to reduce global GHG by 50 per cent globally by 2050.

These measures could enhance the human security of the people affected most. The daily survival problems of a few billion people, their social vulnerability, and their physical exposure to climate change are creating additional dangers for human security, but also challenges for an integrated human security approach combining all four pillars. Brauch concluded his statement to the UN General Assembly by proposing that: 'Freedom from Hazard Impacts' implies a close cooperation between those agencies working on the global environmental agenda and on the hazard agenda. It may be the appropriate time for the United Nations General Assembly to consider adding to the first three pillars of Human Security as \u2022 'Freedom from fear' referring to the policy agenda of peacekeeping, peace-building humanitarian law and disarmament; \u2022 'Freedom from want' referring to the policy agenda of human and sustainable development; \u2022 'Freedom to live in dignity' referring to the policy agenda of human rights, democratic governance and rule of law; \u2022 a fourth pillar as 'freedom from hazard impacts' that brings in the policy agendas dealing with global environmental issues as well as natural hazards and disasters (early warning, disaster response, disaster preparedness, resilience building and reduction of social vulnerability).",

Crutzen of the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, and Hans Jochen Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, have called for a \"second Copernican revolution\" in science that will result in \"a new paradigm for sustainability\" (Clark/Crutzen/ Schellnhuber 2004) to meet the climate paradox of a 50 per cent reduction of global GHG or of an 80 per cent reduction for the G-8 countries within four decades. They argue that the guidance system for a sustainability transition requires \"systems for adaptive management and social learning\" whose elements require \"appropriate information, incentives, and institutions\". Such reform efforts should mobilize \"the right knowledge\", \"integrate knowledge\", balance \"flexibility and stability\", and address the required \"infrastructure and capacity\". They concluded by calling for a new \"social contract\" between society and the scientific community, an idea that was developed further in a WBGU (2011) report. This book, by analysing the linkages between climate change, human security, and violent conflict, aims to contribute new knowledge based on a plurality of scientific disciplines, approaches, theories, and methods in order to develop Beck's 'principle of precaution through prevention', to contribute to the discussion of geopolitical aspects of the required transformation to 'manage' conflicts, to 'prevent' their escalating into violence and wars, and to contribute to a discussion on a scientific and policy agenda for a 'sustainability transition' (Grin/Rotmans/Schot 2010) by addressing a policy priority to 'avoid' future climate-induced violent conflicts and to move towards a sustainable peace.",

            "text": "Instead of a simple stimulus-response model that claims direct links between stress factors and societal responses, the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model of the OECD (1994; 2001a) assumes that human activities put pressure on nature that leads to environmental changes (climate change, water and soil degradation, biodiversity loss) to which the state and society respond with ecological and economic measures and programmes. The OECD's PSR model distinguishes between 'pressure' (P), 'state of the environment' (S), and 'response' (R) indicators. Under 'pressure' key factors are listed (population growth, consumption, poverty), while 'state' refers to the environmental conditions that emerge from this pressure (air pollution, deforestation, degradation) that influence human health and well-being, and 'response' points to the numerous activities carried out by society to avoid, prevent, and reduce negative impacts on the environment, and to protect natural resources from these effects. Among the pressures are human activities in the energy, transport, industry, and agricultural sector on natural resources (air, water, soil, organisms) to which the state, society, business, and international actors respond. Between these three elements of the PSR model there are many complex interactions (resource transfers, information, decisions). 36 The State-Response) model a slightly modified framework. 37 The European Environment Agency (EEA 1998) has developed a framework that distinguishes \"Driving Force -Pressure -State -Impact -Response (DPSIR) 38 that offers a mechanism for the analysis of environmental problems and for the development of environmental indicators. 39 A different model was used as a framework for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2003 (MA , 2005 Leemans 2009 ). It distinguished between direct and indirect drivers of change that directly affect human well-being and ecosystem services. In this framework, besides the material minimum for a good life, health, and good social relations, security is considered as one of the key elements of human well-being that influence freedom of choice. Security has been defined as: a) the ability to live in an environmentally clean and safe shelter, and b) the ability to reduce vulnerability to ecological shocks and stress (MA 2005; Leemans 2009 ). These four models were used to develop environmental indicators and to guide ecosystem assessment. But they did not focus on the linkages between processes of climate change and natural hazards and their sociopolitical consequences.",

Changes in the climate system, such as increases in greenhouse gas concentration, temperature, and precipitation, affect environmental systems and natural resources (e.g. soil, water, ecosystems, forests, biodiversity) through a sequence of complex interactions. 2. Changes in natural resources can have adverse impacts on human values and capabilities, which may provoke human responses that can affect social systems. 3. Depending on the degree of vulnerability, socioeconomic stress increases as a result of water and food insecurity, health problems, migration, economic degradation, the weakening of institutions, diminishing economic growth, and eroding societies. 4. Interdependencies between these factors may lead to societal instability that can manifest itself in violent forms such as riots, insurgencies, urban violence, or armed conflict. 5. A feedback loop allows human beings and societies to adapt to the changing situation and mitigate climate stress through strategies, institutions, and governance mechanisms that may apply technology or human and social capital to adjust the economy and the energy system to the altered environmental conditions.",

Conflicts among the pastoral communities have become very common and increasingly relentless in the northern region of Kenya. The study documents the evidence of climate change in the pastoral areas of Kenya, determines its effects on pastoralist livelihoods, and discusses its effects on resource-based conflicts among pastoral communities. Primary data was obtained from pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and key informants, and four focus group discussions were conducted on how climate change has affected pastoralism. She concludes that resource competition among the pastoralists has resulted in conflict.",

Two theories, namely 'human needs' and 'relative deprivation', provide a framework for explaining the causal link between climate change and violent conflict. The first theory argues that a root cause of conflict is the failure to satisfy universal human needs. The relative deprivation theory explains the gap between people's expectations and reality, between what their life 'is' and what their life 'ought to be'. Based on the literature, he analyses the Niger Delta conflict and the Boko Haram uprising, and identifies the prospects for addressing climate security challenges for Nigeria.",

They offer a statistical investigation into whether there is a regional-scale association between spatio-temporal variations in ecosystem attributes and the occurrence of malnutrition and conflicts, while controlling for other important factors. Contrary to a widely-held view, they suggest a positive association between ecosystem productivity and conflicts. Their analysis does not show any association between shortterm land degradation and either conflicts or malnutrition.",

They assess the coastal people's relative awareness of climate change through the perception of CC-SLR-related events, familiarity with climate change and extreme weather signals, and tacit or intuitive knowledge about the impacts of future SLR.

The theoretical framework relies on the securitization theory of the Copenhagen School and on the 'sociological' approach of the Paris School, and includes the concerns of Critical Security Studies. After a discussion of the theoretical and methodical framework of a revised securitization theory, the empirical part identifies discourse coalitions in the UN debates based on a common understanding of security. The author offers a functional analysis of the discursive tools employed by the speakers and their combination with certain frames, narratives, and storylines. He then discusses the results of these analyses by placing them in their explicit institutional and temporal context, and tries to answer the questions of why climate change is securitized in the United Nations and what the corresponding policy implications are that can be discerned from the actors' discourse strategies.",

To this end, the major linkages between the relevant security implications of climate change and the major challenges for peacebuilding are outlined, and the potential of policies aimed at mitigating climate change through the reduction of deforestation in the context of the (de-)stabilization of conflict-prone areas are discussed.

He then presents possible policy responses, as strategies, policies, and measures to address climate change in the MENA region, using projections to 2030, 2050, and 2100. The chapter discusses the need for improving the knowledge base by research that relies on a required fundamental change to scientific paradigms, to the worldviews of scientists, and to the mindsets of policymakers. This change is needed to cope with the projected multiple security challenges in either a 'reactive' or a 'proactive' mode. Although the study is based in the social and policy sciences, relying on qualitative-sociological methods and approaches used in the research programmes of peace, security, and environmental studies, its goal is multidisciplinary, and it offers a regional case study illustrating the need for a 'fourth sustainability revolution' in the framework of the suggested new 'political geo-ecology for the Anthropocene'.",
