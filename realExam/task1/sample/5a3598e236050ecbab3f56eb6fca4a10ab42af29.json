The United States of America ranked the first in terms of the number of relevant studies published. China attaches great importance to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but still needs to improve in the following areas: for example, insufficient SCI reports on particular pathogens, institutions SCI reports on pathogens lower than world top pathogen research institutions, and lack of influential international pathogen-related journals.

However, many new infectious diseases have emerged since the SARS epidemic in 2003, such as H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, Chikungunya virus disease, and the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Consequently, human beings are constantly facing the threat of new and re-emerging infectious diseases [1] . In addition to naturally occurring infectious diseases, another danger posed by pathogens is their potential use as biological weapons or in bioterrorism. Large-scale research and development of biological weapons were once carried out in some countries [2] . In 2001, the anthrax mail attack in the United States resulted in significant public panic. Therefore, in recent years, both the United States and United Kingdom have released biosecurity or biodefense national strategies for responding to such threats [3] . Pathogens are defined as microorganisms and parasites that cause infectious and parasitic diseases. At present, there are still many infectious diseases that do not have effective treatments. The development of diagnostic test kits, drugs, vaccines and other countermeasures needs to be based on the full understanding of the biological characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of these infectious diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 544, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 801, "end": 804, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1063, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Bibliometric analysis is an important method of scientific research assessment.

For example, the literatures on H7N9 avian influenza is predominate in China, while the most relevant literatures on Burkholderia pseudomallei is in Thailand.

Although the great advance and progress have been made, improvement in the following areas are still needed:(1) Pathogens studied are unbalanced. Relatively large number of published studies is on health-threatening pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus and Japanese encephalitis, while relatively small number of published studies is on biodefense-associated pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis and Ebola virus, specifically at the university level.(2) Institutions SCI reports on pathogens lower than world top pathogen research institutions.
