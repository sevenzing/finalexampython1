Despite improved survival rates over the decades, lung transplant recipients have lower survival rates than other solid organ transplant recipients. The morbidity and mortality following lung transplantation is largely due to infection-and rejection-related complications. This article will review the common infections that develop in the lung transplant recipient, including the general risk factors for infection in this population, and the most frequent bacterial, viral, fungal and other less frequent opportunistic infections. The epidemiology, diagnosis, prophylaxis, treatment and outcomes for the different microbial pathogens will be reviewed. The effects of infection on lung transplant rejection will also be discussed.",

With this success came the dilemma of post-transplant infectious complications, which, to this day, remain a significant contributor to overall morbidity and mortality in the lung transplant recipient (LTR). Of all solid organ transplants, lungs are the most prone to infection, and this is likely due to several factors unique to the lung allograft. Apart from constant exposure to the outside environment, the lungs are exposed to the colonized native airway and have been stripped of their usual mechanisms of defence including the cough reflex, bronchial circulation and lymphatic drainage. These factors, coupled with the induction of an immunosuppressed state collaborate to produce an environment that is ripe for the development of infection.",

CMV is the second most common complication, and its occurrence is much higher than in other solid organ recipients. 2 It appears that the critical period for infections after LT is within the first 90 days. In a recent epidemiological study in which 51 LTR were followed for a mean of 38.2 months, 75% of infectious episodes occurred within the first year after transplantation, and nearly half (42%) occurred within the first 3 months. 3 Bacterial disease accounted for the largest proportion of infections (48%) followed by viral, fungal and mycobacterial disease (35%, 13% and 4%, respectively). In the early post-LT period (days to 1 month), nosocomial organisms account for the majority of infections. Following this period and for the next several months, at a time when immunosuppression is at the highest level, opportunistic organisms such as CMV and fungi account for the majority of infections. In the late post-transplant period, community-acquired bacterial and viral infections develop, although infection with health care-associated organisms remains common (Fig. 1) .",

Immediately postsurgery, LTR may have disruption of normal physical barriers and are at risk of aspiration and infection (e.g. use of nasogastric and endotracheal tubes). 7, 8 There are also other important changes that happen postsurgery. First, during the surgical procedure of LT, there is a complete disruption of the bronchial circulation, and this may cause a loss of epithelium integrity, ciliary function and mucus production. 9 These effects are transient because of the development of collateral circulation but remain at risk of infection during the initial stages. [9] [10] [11] Second, denervation of the allograft may suppress the cough reflex and promote bronchial hyperresponsiveness. 2 Third, the lymphatic drainage of the allograft is also severed promoting stasis and oedema in the bronchial tissues impairing normal healing. 2 Fourth, stenosis or necrosis may occur at the site of the bronchial anastomosis, which may in turn facilitate colonization and invasion by opportunistic pathogens and decrease the clearance of secretions beyond the anastomosis. 12",

Cyclosporine A binds to cyclophylin preventing the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T-lymphocytes (T cells) by calcineurin. Tacrolimus binds to FK-binding protein 12 inhibiting calcineurin and preventing the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells. 13, 15 By reducing the activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, both drugs reduce the production of interleukin-2 limiting the clonal expansion of activated T cells (Fig. 2) . 16 Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are the commonly used antimetobolites after LT. Azathioprine, a derivative of 6-mercaptopurine, inhibits both ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid production, reducing the proliferation of both T cells and B-lymphocytes. MMF is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2 ). This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, which both T cells and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent of. 17 Other maintenance agents that have been used less frequently to maintain immunosuppression include sirolimus and everolimus. Sirolimus binds to the FK-binding protein 12 and through the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway prevents the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid and proteins by T cells (Fig. 2) . 18 Through an independent mechanism, sirolimus also affects B-lymphocytes and decreases cytokine and antigen production. 19 Everolimus reduces the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase activity, inhibiting the downstream pathways of proliferation and activation of T cells. 20 Finally, through the alteration of gene transcription factors, corticosteroids can exert a wide variety of immunosuppressive effects: interruption of antigen presentation, changes in the production of cytokines and alteration in the proliferative responses of various cell lines. 21 ",

            "text": "The use of induction agents after LT varies among centres. These agents include OKT3, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), alemtuzumab and basiliximab. OKT3 is a murine monoclonal antibody that inactivates the T cell receptor-CD3 complex preventing the activation of circulating T cells with a partial sparing of T regulatory cells. ATG is a polyclonal antibody directed against lymphocytes. It depletes circulating lymphocytes through complement-mediated lysis and destruction by the reticuloendothelial system after opsonization. 13 Basiliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the a subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor inhibiting the differentiation and proliferation of T cells. 22, 23 Alemtuzumab is a murine monoclonal antibody that targets CD52. This receptor is present in macrophages, monocytes, B-lymphocytes and T cells among other inflammatory cells. The binding of CD52 causes complementmediated cytolysis and activation of pathways leading to apoptosis. 13 The use of OKT3 is now significantly limited due to an increase risk of infection. [24] [25] [26] [27] For this reason, most centres have elected to use ATG, basiliximab or alemtuzumab, in combination with corticosteroids for induction of immunosuppression after LT. 28 Evaluation of large series of solid organ recipients has shown that this combination prevents graft rejection and improves survival. 29 ATG does not increase the rate of infections in transplant recipients and has been associated with a survival benefit. 30, 31 Basiliximab compared with ATG does not increase the risk of infection and was safer than OKT3 in heart and LTR. 22, 23, 26, 32 Alemtuzumab was recently shown to improve survival compared with ATG. 33 Despite these positive outcomes, the immunosuppression is more profound during induction, and patients should be monitored closely for infection during this period.",

Those patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) present the highest risk for recipient-harboured infection due to the frequent colonization and infection with multiresistant microorganisms including bacteria (Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci) and fungi. Resistant Gramnegative organisms pose perhaps the greatest risk, and some studies suggest an association between pretransplant colonizing organisms from patients with suppurative lung disease and pneumonias following LT. 34 The majority of recent data suggests that patients colonized with multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas appear to have acceptable outcomes, including survival following LT, and should not be excluded on that criterion alone. 35, 36 In contrast, a former subspecies of pseudomonas, now subspeciated as Burkholderia cenocepacia due to its unique resistance patterns, can pose significant problems in transplant recipients. There have now been at least nine distinct genotypic variants (genomovars) identified in the Burkholderia cenocepacia complex. 37 Colonization with Burkholderia cenocepacia complex (genomovar 3) can result in significant morbidity and mortality post-transplant and should be considered a strong relative contraindication to LT, 38, 39 although isolated reports of successful outcomes have been reported. 40 In one study of 75 patients, 38 there was a significant difference in 1-year-survival between those patients not infected (92%) and those colonized with a non-Burkholderia cenocepacia strain (89%) compared with those colonized with Burkholderia cenocepacia (29%). Similar results of variable survival rates based on Burkholderia cenocepacia species have been found in other studies. 37, 39 Because of these overwhelming data, the majority of transplant centres will not transplant colonized or infected patients with this organism.",

The results obtained from this screening are used to assess the patient's overall candidacy for LT (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus is generally an exclusion) and also to stratify the patient for screening and prophylaxis in the post-LT period (e.g. CMV and Epstein-Barr virus).

Both of these individual processes induce a cytokine cascade that in essence promotes the development of the other. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha, a key signal in the reactivation of CMV from latency, is released during allograft rejection, thereby facilitating the onset of viral replication and subsequent infection. Conversely, infection of the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle by CMV leads to an upregulation of adhesion molecules promoting an increase in the quantity of inflammatory cells in the graft and subsequent development of rejection. Additionally, molecular mimicry and the production of anti-endothelial antibodies with CMV may also play a role in the development of rejection. 52 CMV serology of both donor and recipient must be checked prior to transplant. 53 ",

The previous method of diagnosis, pp65 antigen detection, has been replaced by quantitative nucleic acid-based amplification testing via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the recognition of viraemia by most centres, with 85% of institutions using this method for monitoring and diagnosis. 55 There are no universally accepted viral load cut-offs for positive and negative results, and that reported values may be dissimilar between different laboratories. Despite this, current guidelines on the management of CMV in solid organ transplant patients do not clearly favour one test over the other and cite both as acceptable options for diagnosis. Additionally, viral culture of blood or urine has a limited role for diagnosis and is not routinely recommended. 53 Most recently, tests for cell-mediated immunity against CMV have shown promise for predicting risk of developing disease. Lisboa and colleagues demonstrated that cell-mediated immunity to CMV, as shown by a CD8+ T cell response assay, was associated with decreased risk of developing disease in patients with detectable low-level viraemia. Twenty four of 26 patients (92.3%) with a positive interferon-gamma release assay were able to clear their viraemia without disease compared with 5 of 11 (45.5%) in patients with a negative cell-mediated immunity at onset (P = 0.004). 56 In a similar study, the same group was able to show that a negative assay was associated with a higher chance of developing late-onset CMV after prophylaxis. In their study, CMV disease occurred in 2/38 (5.3%) patients with a detectable interferongamma response versus 16/70 (22.9%) patients with a negative response (P = 0.038). 57 ",

            "text": "There are two accepted approaches to the prevention of disease from CMV, universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy, and although there are no randomized trials comparing one strategy versus the other in LTR, most centres favour the former or may sometimes employ both. 55 The first, universal prophylaxis, involves administration of antivirals to all transplant patients deemed to be at high risk by serostatus. The second, pre-emptive therapy, is comprised of monitoring at-risk patients for viral replication and administering antivirals at a predetermined level of replication in the hopes of treating patients prior to the onset of disease. A Cochrane Review comparing prophylaxis in different groups of solid organ transplant patients with antivirals versus placebo or no treatment showed a significant reduction in disease (relative risk 0.42), infection (relative risk 0.61), mortality from CMV disease (relative risk 0.26) and allcause mortality (relative risk 0.63). Interestingly, the review also found a decrease in the risk of developing herpes-simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus and bacterial infections. 58 Prophylaxis may not only be beneficial in decreasing direct morbidity and mortality from CMV disease but may also have secondary effects by decreasing the morbidity and mortality of both acute and chronic rejection. The Cochrane Review mentioned earlier failed to show a difference in acute rejection episodes, but other small studies have shown statistically significant differences in LTR specifically and it is generally believed that prevention of CMV decreases the risk for acute rejection. [58] [59] [60] The data for BOS are more encouraging. A recent study by Chmiel and colleagues was able to show a 23% absolute risk reduction of developing BOS in a group of LTR on CMV prophylaxis as compared with a historical cohort that was not prophylaxed and a 35% absolute risk reduction compared with data in the literature (P = 0.002). 1 Most centres provide prophylaxis for a period of 3-6 months after transplantation; however, the optimal duration of prophylaxis has not been well established and is currently under debate. 55 The guidelines recommend a minimum of 6 months for LTR. 53 Recent data suggest that this window of prophylaxis should possibly be extended, especially for donor-positive/ recipient-negative patients. Palmer and colleagues report the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing a decrease in the risk of CMV disease with extended prophylaxis. In this study, 136 LTR who completed 3 months of valganciclovir prophylaxis were randomized to an additional 9 months of valganciclovir versus placebo. The risk of CMV disease was reduced (32% vs 4%; P < 0.001) in the extendedcourse group versus the short-course group. There were also statistically significant reductions in CMV infection (64% vs 10%; P < 0.001) and disease severity as measured by viral load with extended treatment. Acute rejection episodes, opportunistic infections, adverse events and CMV UL97 ganciclovir-resistance mutations were similar between both groups. 61 The international consensus guidelines list valganciclovir and ganciclovir (oral or intravenous (IV)) as the antivirals of choice for the prevention of CMV disease and state that CMV immunoglobulin may also be used in combination with these two, but there are limited data to support its use. 53 ",

Valganciclovir demonstrated non-inferiority in regard to clinical resolution of disease as well as eradication of viraemia in both the intent-to-treat and the per-protocol arms of the study. 62 The current guidelines recommend oral valganciclovir at twice-daily dosing or IV ganciclovir for the treatment of nonsevere CMV disease. As there are no efficacy data for valganciclovir in severe or life-threatening disease, IV ganciclovir is still the 'gold standard' for those patients. In both groups, serial monitoring of viraemia should occur optimally at 1-week intervals, and treatment should be continued for a minimum of 2 weeks and until viral eradication has been documented with two consecutive tests. The use of secondary prophylaxis is generally recommended for 1-3 months after treatment of disease. 53",

            "text": "Infection with a CARV is common after LT, and with the development of new diagnostic techniques, the incidence quoted in older literature is likely underestimated. A study of LTR undergoing serial surveillance and diagnostic BAL over a 3-year period showed that a respiratory virus was isolated in 51.6% of patients on at least one BAL sample. Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen isolated, followed by parainfluenza, coronavirus, influenza, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 63, 64 CARV is being increasingly recognized as contributors to significant morbidity in immunocompromised hosts and can cause severe and life-threatening pneumonitis. Additionally, there appears to be evidence that infection with these organisms can also lead to a decrease in graft survival. A retrospective cohort study of 259 LTR followed over 5 years showed a significantly increased risk of developing BOS or death from BOS in the group that was diagnosed with a CARV infection. 65 Given the paucity of effective antiviral treatment for most of these viruses, early diagnosis is essential for both treatment and to minimize spread among other immunocompromised patients. With the exception of influenza and RSV, for which treatments exist, supportive care and a reduction in immunosuppression remain the cornerstones of care for the treatment of CARV. A complete listing of all the viruses that commonly affect LTR would be beyond the scope of this article so we will focus on those that have the most clinical bearing, namely influenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza. As it typically does not cause respiratory tract disease, we will not discuss Epstein-Barr virus, except to mention its known association with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder after LT.",

            "text": "Infection of normal hosts with influenza most commonly causes a self-limited disease with upper respiratory symptoms, myalgias and fever; however, infection in LTR appears to be associated with increased risk of lower respiratory tract involvement by either a primary viral or a concomitant bacterial superinfection. This was illustrated in a small series of LTR admitted for influenza where all appeared to have pulmonary parenchymal involvement on imaging and by BAL as well as in another series by Vilchez and colleagues, where 7 of 15 patients with influenza were found to have pulmonary infiltrates, 5 of which were attributed to a primary viral pneumonia after BAL. 66, 67 Novel H1N1 influenza appears to have similar clinical features, although there appears to be an increased rate of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea; which may be prominent. 68 Due to the increased severity of disease, all LTR and their household contacts should receive annual influenza vaccination for prevention of disease. 69 Diagnosis is essential, and efforts should be made to establish the type, as specific therapy will depend on resistance patterns. 69 Diagnosis of seasonal influenza is made by rapid antigen detection of nasopharyngeal swabs, but this method appears to be unsatisfactory for detection of novel H1N1 and molecular real-time PCR methods are currently approved for use when swine flu is suspected. 70 In addition to supportive care and isolation, treatment involves the use of the antiviral agents amantadine and rimantidine for susceptible influenza A strains, and zanamavir and oseltamivir for both influenza A and B strains. Due to the variation in circulating strains from year to year, it is important to stay abreast of the current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 71 for appropriate treatment. 72 In addition, given the prolonged viral shedding, the typical treatment course of 5 days may be insufficient in LTR, and prolonged therapy may be required. Some experts advocate treating influenza even if symptom onset is greater than 48 h and treating until viral replication ceases. 73 Treatment of novel H1N1 is limited by the resistance of the strain to the M2 inhibitors: amandatine and rimantidine. As such, current guidelines recommend treatment with oseltamivir or perhaps even zanamavir if resistance is suspected to this agent. IV or higher dose therapy is recommended for critically ill patients, and immunosuppression should be decreased. 63, 64 RSV By the age of 2, virtually, all children have been infected with RSV, although reinfection can occur throughout life, and early acquisition after transplant or with augmented immunosuppression is a risk factor for severe disease. 72 As with influenza, infection can vary from a self-limited upper respiratory illness to severe pneumonia and occurs through inhalation of infectious droplets and contact with fomites, making isolation precautions paramount for prevention.",

Other risk factors include the immunomodulatory effect of coexistent infections (i.e. viral) and neutropenia. [82] [83] [84] As previously mentioned, transmission of infection from donor to host after LT can occur, or the native lung may serve as a reservoir of fungal organisms during single LT. 85 This is particularly important in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in whom the lung surfaces are irregular and may have colonized bullae. 84 Pretransplant fungal colonization is common, especially in patients with CF and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and it has been associated with post-transplant fungal infection and BOS, 86 although not all colonized patients develop active/invasive infection. 83 The most common fungal pathogens in LTR are Candida and Aspergillus species, while Zygomycetes, Scedosporium, Fusarium, Cryptococcus species, histoplasmosis and coccidiomycosis occur less commonly. In general, these infections are more prevalent during the first few months after transplantation and, in some cases such as with Cryptococcus species, histoplasmosis or coccidiomyocosis, can present as a reac-tivation of a latent infection. Fungal infections can manifest as invasive disease with a reported 1-year cumulative incidence of 8.6% in LTR. 87 Similarly, disseminated disease, post-transplant empyema, and airway and anastomotic infection have been reported.",

Among these species, Aspergillus fumigatus remains the most common cause of invasive disease. 89 The majority of Aspergillus isolates in sputum or BAL represent colonization (23%), and only a fraction of these will develop invasive disease (<10%), which carries a high mortality. 69, 90, 91 In LTR, the risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis rises with airway colonization by Aspergillus species. 84, 89, 92 Colonization is found in up to 50% of patients with CF. Despite higher colonization compared with other populations, these patients have lower risk of invasive aspergillosis, but a higher risk for aspergillus tracheobronchitis. 93 In addition to colonization, airway ischaemia and BOS have also been implicated as risk factors for invasive aspergillosis. 84, 89, 92 Disseminated disease has been reported with an incidence of 22%, occurring as reactivation from an occult focus and/or as a new post-transplant infection. 84 Other less common manifestations, such as mediastinal masses, skin, softtissue, sinus, orbit, central nervous system, sternal wound and chest wall infections, have also been described. 89, 91 Diagnosis There are limited data on the role of minimally invasive tests such galactomannan, PCR and 1,3-b-Dglucan assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in LTR. 94,95 1,3-b-D-glucan, a cell component of all fungi, has been used in the diagnosis of multiple invasive fungal infections, but unfortunately, the role in LTR has limitations. 96 Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis may require aggressive procedures (i.e. biopsy) to verify tissue involvement; however, this is not always possible, and often, the diagnosis is reached on evaluation of computed tomography chest findings and fungal staining/culture from bronchoscopy (i.e. BAL). The radiological findings of invasive aspergillosis include consolidations, nodules, cavitary lesions and mass-like opacities, often with a 'halo sign'. 84 In cases where the diagnosis is not possible with a less invasive approach, a biopsy with fungal stain/culture and histopathology may be required. Once the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is made, computed tomography or magnetic resonance of the central nervous system is suggested to rule out disseminated disease.",

Despite this, the risk of late infection after discontinuation of prophylaxis or even while using it is still present. 97 The treatment of pretransplant colonization has not been shown to reduce the incidence of post-transplant aspergillosis, but invasive disease in the pretransplant setting should be treated. 90 Recent data has shown the superiority of voriconazole compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but solid organ transplant patients were poorly represented in the study. 98 A major concern with the use of voriconazole in LTR is the interaction with most of the immunosuppressants used in this population. Tacrolimus, sirolimus and cyclosporine can potentially increase the serum concentrations of voriconazole. For this reason, close monitoring of drug levels is needed. Other options for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis are posaconazole and itraconazole, but their roles as first-line agents are not well established. The echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin) have shown some in vitro activity against Aspergillus species, but their utility as firstline antifungals for this infection has not been studied either.

Empirical therapy should then be adjusted based on susceptibilities. For Candida albicans infections, fluconazole and echinocandins have been effective, but in widespread disease, amphotericin B might be considered. Finally, the duration of therapy varies among patients and with the degree and severity of infection. In candidaemia, treatment can extend up to 2 weeks but may be even longer in cases of more invasive disease. 69",

In patients whose explanted lung is found to have histoplasmosis, antifungal prophylaxis after transplant seems effective at preventing reactivation of this infection. 106 There is no clear consensus about the duration of prophylaxis, and 18 months has been reported to be effective. 106 Coccidioidomycosis is typically acquired when patients are exposed to the desert soil of the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.

For universal prophylaxis, voriconazole, itraconazole and amphotericin B are commonly used, while targeted prophylaxis with fluconazole (Candida), voriconazole and itraconazole (Aspergillus) are used based on the results of surveillance bronchoscopy. 114 In general, the choice for antifungal prophylaxis depends, in part, on the presence of specific risk factors such as colonization with Aspergillus, presence of airway stents or ischaemia, single lung transplantation, CMV infection, hypogammaglobulinaemia or treatment of acute rejection. 69 Despite a lack of controlled trials, several studies suggest potential prevention of invasive aspergillosis with the use of either compound of amphotericin B. 116, 117 Inhaled amphotericin B has lower systemic toxicity, better delivery to the site of fungal exposure and a lower likelihood of resistance when compared with systemic antifungal therapy. 116, 118, 119 The data regarding voriconazole for prophylaxis in LTR is promising, especially given the excellent bioavailability, broad antifungal coverage and good drug levels achieved in lung tissue. 120, 121 Unfortunately, the numerous drug interactions with some of the immunosuppressants, and its potential adverse effects may preclude its use as a first-line prophylactic agent. Itraconazole has clinical effectiveness similar to the combination of voriconazole and inhaled amphotericin B and may have lower hepatotoxicity when compared with voriconazole. 114 Duration of antifungal prophylaxis varies from centre to centre. The use of voriconazole or itraconazole for 3-6 months with or without amphotericin B has been shown to decrease the incidence of Aspergillus infection after transplantation. 88 The use of inhaled amphotericin B is typically for 2 weeks or is discontinued at the moment of discharge. In cases where pretransplant fungal colonization is present, patients may be treated for several weeks before LT and continued for up to 3 months after transplantation. Because LTR is at high risk for fungal infections, antifungal prophylaxis should be started in most patients after LT with careful consideration of sideeffects and interactions to improve outcomes and be guided by cultures from donor, graft and recipient.",

In the CF population, the presence of NTM should not preclude LT, but careful monitoring for recurrence after transplant should be performed. 124 The diagnostic criteria of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Disease Society of America apply to pre-and post-LTR (symptoms, radiological findings and microbiology). 130 Similarly, the antimicrobial therapy recommended in the NTM guidelines is applicable to LTR. 130 Therapy for mycobacterial infection in the immunosuppressed patient can be problematic particularly due to drug interactions and increased toxicity.

During the transplant procedure, the bronchial circulation is not reanastomosed, and thus, the bronchial anastomosis must receive collateral blood flow from the pulmonary circulation, is subject to ischaemia and may be susceptible to infection. This diagnosis is easily confirmed with bronchoscopic examination revealing purulence, ulcerations, pseudomembranes, necrotic material, dehiscence and sometimes narrowing at the site of the anastomoses, and histological and culture results. The organisms most commonly causing tracheobronchitis in this setting are bacteria-(Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus) and fungi Aspergillus (an incidence of 32% and 20%, respectively) and Candida. 84, 132, 133 Treatment includes appropriate antibacterial and/or antifungal antimicrobials. The treatment of airway anastomotic infections with fungi is with a combination of both systemic and sometimes inhaled antifungal agents. 134, 135 For aspergillosis, the combination of voriconazole and nebulized amphotericin B along with reduction of immunosuppression has been advocated. 99, 134 Duration of therapy for tracheobronchitis is usually determined by resolution under bronchoscopic surveillance. Late sequelae may include stenosis and or stricture requiring intervention with balloon dilation or occasionally endobronchial stent placement. A study demonstrated a decrease in 5-year survival in single LTR who developed bronchial anastomosis fungal infections. 132 Other types of bacterial infection described in LTR include those of the pleural space, blood stream and wounds, with organisms often isolated in the nosocomial setting, and Clostridium difficile.",

A study revealed that the rate of PJP did not decline after 1 year of transplantation, suggesting that prophylaxis should be continued beyond this period. 141 LTR should receive at least 6 months of prophylaxis post-transplant, and if tolerated, adequately, it should be continued indefinitely. In those patients in whom prophylaxis has been discontinued, it should be resumed if the patient develops acute or chronic rejection requiring augmented immunosuppression.

[152] [153] [154] [155] Because macrolides are felt to slow the progression of BOS, it has been postulated that this response is due to the potential treatment of a chronic infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae, 154, 156 although macrolide immunomodulation also plays an important role. It has been shown that a positive serology and PCR testing for Chlamydia pneumoniae on BAL samples increases the rate of BOS and early mortality. 157, 158 Supporting this theory further, a study recently demonstrated that macrolides can prevent the development of BOS. 153 Fungal pathogens have been also associated with the development of BOS. 159 Fungal pneumonitis and aspergillus colonization have been identified as independent risk factors for BOS and mortality related to rejection. 151, 159, 160 Moreover, the combination of lateonset aspergillosis and chronic allograft dysfunction was a risk factor for poorer survival. 132",

Although there are non-modifiable factors that are innate to the patient or to the nature of the procedure, there are several modifiable factors that can be recognized and changed so as to optimize the patient's chances for survival and further extend life. Prompt recognition and treatment of these factors is paramount for appropriate management. Prophylaxis strategies continue to evolve and show promise for several of the infectious agents. Avoidance of these infectious complications may not only lead to a decrease in the direct consequences of infection but also to a reduction in the subsequent causes of ultimate graft failure including both acute and chronic rejection. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem, and although newer antimicrobials will likely be of benefit, especially against viral and fungal pathogens, prevention of these diseases remains the best approach. Careful consideration and further research are needed regarding the mechanisms by which infection and subsequent inflammation alters the immunoregulatory machinery of the host and subsequently leads to the development failure of the allograft. Factors that are important in evaluating an infectious episode include time after transplant, immunosuppression, CMV serostatus, prophylaxis regimen and treatment for acute rejection. 3 Given that outcomes appear to be improved with early recognition and treatment of disease, all practitioners must always maintain a high index of suspicion caring for these patients.",
