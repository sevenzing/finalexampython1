Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities-Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), NO 2 , and SO 2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities.

Monetarily, the impact is curtailed by average 36% in mortality and about 28% in morbidity in the year 2020 due to substantial reduction in AP amid reduced anthropogenic activities owing to COVID-19 lockdown. In terms of an absolute number of people affected, an average 31% reduction is for combined mortality and morbidity for all cities. Impacts of NO 2 are zeroed for the year 2020. For PM 2.5 mortality cases, Delhi sees the highest fall in the number of cases for 2020 from 2019, followed by Paris, Wuhan, and London, in that order. It can be seen the trend in mortality damages between the cities is not similar to morbidity, indicating that there could be other compounding factors like age, life expectancy, and standard of living in these cities. 4. The total of morbidity and mortality damages reduction in 2020 is compared with the economic damages being reported for the cities. It is reported that London (18.6B$) suffered maximum economic damage during its respective lockdown days, while Wuhan suffered the lowest (0.56B$). Paris (15.81B$) and Delhi (5.36B$) suffered the second-highest and lowest damages, respectively. Delhi, London, Wuhan, and Paris prevented AP damages worth 6.4B$, 2.09B$, 0.97B$, and 0.47 B$, respectively, in 2020. This indicates that Wuhan and Delhi could extract better worth from prevention of damages from lockdown as compared to their lockdown losses. This might be due to the fact that both these cities are highly polluted as compared to Paris and London and are economically developing as well. Wuhan is actually higher as the economic damages incurred by that city are the lowest. The lowest recovery is made by Paris, while London stands at second-lowest.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "It is apparent that while quantifying AP damages in terms of exposure and affected population is fruitful, there are more insights which can be explored to understand the true magnitude of the damage caused by it. The monetary evaluation gives a common denomination for comparison and for making a rational decision for policy formulation. The above research of four major global cities demonstrates that while the world is suffering from enormous economic damage, the lockdown has created some positive for the air environment and hence the human health as well. While the above analysis might hold true for the majority of the cities suffering from a probable of AP, a detailed analysis should be carried out for the respective city before making decisions. Accounting of the cost and benefits due to halting of anthropogenic activities gives us a clear indication of the change of damage being incurred on the ecosystem and on human health. It further suggests that stronger policies are needed to safeguard the ecosystem balance.
