            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) neutralization occurring at the E2 region 412-426 (EP-I) could be enhanced when antibodies directed specifically to the E2 region 434-446 (EP-II) were removed from serum samples of persistently infected patients and vaccinated chimpanzees, a phenomenon of so-called antibody interference. Here, we show that this type of interference can be observed in individuals after immunization with recombinant E1E2 proteins. One hundred twelve blinded serum samples from a phase I, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial using recombinant HCV E1E2 with MF59C.1 adjuvant in healthy HCV-negative adults were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for binding reactivity to peptides representing the E2 regions 412-426 (EP-I) and 434-446 (EP-II). All samples were subsequently tested for neutralizing activity using cell-culture HCV 1a(H77)/2a chimera, HCV pseudotype particles (HCVpp) H77, and HCVpp HCV-1 after treatment to remove EP-IIspecific antibodies or mock treatment with a control peptide. Among the 112 serum samples, we found 22 double positive (EP-I and EP-II), 6 EP-II positive only, 14 EP-I positive only, and 70 double negative. Depleting EP-II antibodies from double-positive serum samples increased 50% inhibitory dose (ID 50 ) neutralizing antibody titers (up to 4.9-fold) in up to 72% of samples (P \u00a3 0.0005), contrasting with ID 50 neutralization titer increases in 2 of 70 double-negative samples (2.9%; P > 0.5). In addition, EP-I-specific antibody levels in serum samples showed a significant correlation with ID 50 neutralization titers when EP-II antibodies were removed (P < 0.0003). Conclusion: These data show that antibodies to the region 434-446 are induced during immunization of individuals with recombinant E1E2 proteins, and that these antibodies can mask effective neutralizing activity from EP-Ispecific antibodies. Elicitation of EP-II-specific antibodies with interfering capacity should be avoided in producing an effective cross-neutralizing vaccine aimed at the HCV envelope proteins.

            "text": "H epatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic infection in patients despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Overall, it has been determined that 15%-20% of all individuals that become infected with HCV progress to serious end-stage liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. 1 Although current drug therapies can clear HCV infections, 2 treatment success can be limited by numerous factors, including access to care, cost of therapy, patient adherence, relative efficacy of different regimens, side effects, viral genotype, and host factors. It is also unclear whether individuals are protected from reinfection after drug treatment. [3] [4] [5] Antibody-based prophylaxis has not been successful in preventing HCV recurrence in liver transplant recipients, 6, 7 and an effective vaccine is yet to be developed. 8 The HCV envelope glycoproteins E1/E2, represent primary targets for vaccines designed to induce neutralizing antibody responses. It is clear that antibody to surface proteins of HCV can neutralize the virus in vitro and in vivo, [9] [10] [11] and a recent meta-analysis of chimpanzee vaccine studies showed that increased rates of clearance were achieved when structural proteins were included in the vaccine. 12 Using in vitro cell-culture systems, patient plasma samples and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been identified that are capable of cross-neutralizing different genotypes of HCV. [13] [14] [15] [16] Despite this role for neutralizing antibodies in preventing HCV infection, mechanisms also exist for HCV evasion of the neutralizing response. These include genetic escape, 17 polymorphisms in E2, 18 cell-to-cell spread, 19 association with lipoproteins, 20 and glycan shielding of the surface proteins. 21, 22 Additionally, the presence of interfering antibodies recognizing the HCV E2 region (amino acids [aa] 434-446) have been demonstrated in sera from patients chronically infected with HCV. 23, 24 A role for interfering antibodies has been suggested for several viral agents in addition to HCV, including influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (reviewed in a previous work 25 ). Interfering antibodies can bind to noncritical binding sites and prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies by steric hindrance, or non-neutralizing antibodies can cause conformational changes in an epitope and prevent binding of neutralizing antibodies.",

Antibodies purified against EP-II (aa 432-446) were non-neutralizing and interfered with the neutralizing activity of antibodies directed to EP-I. 23 Further data confirmed this interference in sera from chimpanzees immunized with recombinant E1E2 proteins. 24 Depletion of interfering antibodies to EP-II increased the neutralization titer against 1a/2a chimeric cell-culture HCV (HCVcc) and revealed crossneutralizing activities of the chimpanzee immune sera.",

The function of these antibodies is associated with the critical residues that are recognized during binding. 28, 29 Recently, a bifurcated mode of mAb action at EP-II was described involving antibodies interacting with two primary anchor sites of the epitope. 30 It was hypothesized that non-neutralizing antibodies bind preferably to the a-helical structure of the epitope whereas neutralizing antibodies recognize two additional amino acids in the region.",

All 112 blinded samples were also treated for depletion of EP-II antibodies or mock treated with influenza-specific peptides, and tested in ELISA and neutralization assays. After completion of the studies, samples were unblinded and statistically analyzed based upon treatment groups or reactivity to EP-I and EP-II peptides. The blinded panel consisted of samples from 45 vaccinated subjects and 11 placebo subjects. Each subject was represented by two samples: one prevaccination and one postvaccination. The distribution of single-positive, double-positive, and doublenegative samples in each group (pre-and postplacebo or vaccine) is shown in Fig. 1 . Within the placebo group, all preplacebo samples tested negative for both epitopes (Fig. 1A) whereas two of the postplacebo samples demonstrated low reactivity to EP-I (Fig. 1B) . Among the 45 prevaccine samples, six tested positive (P/N >2.0) for EP-I only and four samples tested positive for both epitopes (Fig. 1C ). After vaccination, reactivity against either or both epitopes increased significantly (P < 0.0002; Fig. 1D ) with 30 of 45 (66.6%) samples testing positive for at least one epitope (Fig. 1D ). The signal did not change for 4 of the 10 subjects that showed prevaccine reactivity to EP-I or EP-II, suggesting the presence of cross-reactive antibodies in these samples. Using the pre-and postplacebo and the prevaccine samples (n 5 67), we calculated that ELISA specificity for EP-I and EP-II was 82% and 94%, respectively. The frequency of samples testing positive for EP-I or EP-II postvaccination correlated with the dose of vaccine given during the study (Fig. 2) .

For mock-treated samples, levels of EP-I and EP-II did not show a significant correlation with ID 50 titers (Fig.  6A ,B); r 2 values for both analyses were less than 0.1. However, after treatment with the EP-II peptide, levels of EP-I antibodies correlated significantly with ID 50 titers ( Fig. 6C ; P < 0.0001; r 2 5 0.442; Spearman's correlation coefficient: r 5 0.697) whereas reduced anti-EP-II levels in treated samples did not correlate with higher or lower ID 50 titers, despite an increase in ID 50 titers in many samples (Fig. 6D) . When we performed the same analysis for HCV-1 HCVpp, we found a significant correlation between both EP-I (P 5 0.01) and EP-II (P 5 0.0005) antibody levels and ID 50 neutralization titers in mock-treated samples (Fig. 7A,B) . When EP-II antibodies were removed, we observed a similar increase in ID 50 titer correlation for EP-I antibodies as that noted for H77 particles ( Fig. 7C ; P 5 0.002; r 2 5 0.26; Spearman's correlation coefficient: r 5 0.594). Also, similar to that observed for H77 particles, reduced EP-II antibody levels in treated samples did not correlate significantly with higher or lower ID 50 titers (P 5 0.739) (Fig. 7D) . These data suggest that levels of EP-I antibodies are a strong indicator of the neutralizing capacity of these samples only in the presence of low amounts of EP-II antibodies.",

            "text": "Development of prophylactic vaccines against HCV remains challenging. Current data suggest that it would be advantageous to include HCV structural proteins in vaccines. 12 The circulating virus in infected individuals exists as a quasi-species population with variability throughout the genome, but E1/E2 glycoproteins exhibit higher levels of variability both between and among genotypes and subtypes. 38 Thus, generation of antibodies against the most conserved epitopes of the envelope proteins would be beneficial for development of effective vaccines designed to induce neutralizing antibodies. A mAb recognizing a conserved epitope located between aa 412-423 within E2 (EP-I) has been shown to inhibit E2 binding to CD81 39 and to be cross-neutralizing. 15 Antibodies to this region have been shown to be induced during vaccination and natural infection, 23, 31 but, at the same time, antibodies to a downstream region, aa 434-446, are also induced and these can interfere with the neutralizing EP-I antibodies. 23, 24 Our studies on 112 blinded serum samples derived from a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers support our hypothesis that antibodies to EP-II could interfere with the neutralizing activity of sera that also contain EP-I antibodies. This was demonstrated using both cellculture virus and pseudotype viruses carrying HCV envelopes from 1a genotypes H77 and HCV-1. Removal of EP-II-specific antibodies from doublepositive sera resulted in up to a 4.9-fold increase in neutralizing activity of samples (P < 0.0005; Figs. 4 and 5). This significant change in neutralization was not observed in samples positive for only EP-II or for samples negative for both epitopes. We observed increased neutralizing activity in a few EP-I-only-positive samples, which became significant (P 5 0.03) when using HCV-1 HCVpp (Fig. 5E ). This could have been owing to low amounts of EP-I-and EP-II-specific antibodies present in these samples. The juxtaposition of the HVR1 region to EP-I could potentially impact the EP-II interfering effects if anti-HVR1 antibodies are present. Our studies using the HCV-1 HCVpp indicate this is not the case. We observed similar effects of EP-II treatment on ID 50 titers using HCV-1 HCVpp as we did when using H77 HCVcc and HCVpp.",

            "text": "Of the 22 double-positive samples treated in our studies, only eight did not display an increase in neutralizing activity after treatment; remaining negative for neutralizing antibodies. However, these samples contained some of the highest ratios of EP-II/EP-I antibodies, which could indicate that a threshold of antibody ratio is needed to achieve neutralization and/or that EP-I-specific antibodies are non-neutralizing in these samples. We investigated this concept of EP-II/EP-I antibody ratios, and although neutralizing activity in serum samples was associated with low ratios, it was not an absolute correlation (Fig. 8) , suggesting that more-complex interactions exist between these antibodyantigen pairs that may determine neutralization in these serum samples. Interference between EP-I and EP-II antibodies is further supported by the significant correlation of EP-I antibody titers with ID 50 neutralizing titers only when EP-II antibodies are removed from samples (Figs. 6C and 7C). When using the H77 HCVcc and HCVpp systems, we found a lack of correlation between levels of EP-II and neutralization (Fig. 6) , which suggests further that antibodies to EP-II induced by vaccination do not contribute greatly to the overall neutralizing activity in the samples. We did find a significant correlation between EP-II antibody levels and neutralization using the HCV-1 HCVpp system (Fig. 7B ). This could be owing to higher levels of HCV-1-specific antibodies, such as anti-HVR1 antibodies, being present in these samples with the EP-II signal acting as an indicator of a better immune response to the vaccine. This correlation was no longer observed after EP-II treatment (Fig. 7D) . Treatment resulted in a greater number of samples with increased ID 50 titers and low EP-II signal, as opposed to samples with low EP-II signal losing neutralizing ability. Overall, we did not find a direct correlation between anti-EP-II antibody levels and neutralization in any of the systems used. Therefore, we conclude that the EP-II-specific antibodies induced by vaccination with recombinant E1E2 proteins bind distinct residues in the 434-446 region of E2, which could result in an interfering phenotype instead of a neutralizing phenotype. This is in contrast to a number of publications showing that antibodies directed at this region of E2 can inhibit viral infectivity and that residues within this region are involved in CD81 binding. 14, 16, 28, 29 However, these previous studies have also shown that the functional qualities of such antibodies differ depending upon the specific epitopes recognized or critical binding residues. 28, 29 The majority of neutralizing activity detected in our assays appears to be associated with EP-I-specific antibodies. This is consistent with previous reports of crossneutralization with samples from this phase I clinical trial, 33, 34 given that the EP-I region is highly conserved between genotypes. 23 More recently, a subset of samples from this cohort was shown to bind competitively with cross-neutralizing mAbs recognizing residues within EP-I as well as residues located elsewhere in E1 and E2, 40 which further supports the cross-neutralizing potential of these vaccine samples. Testing for cross-neutralizing activity to other genotypes was not possible in our studies using the treated sera owing to limited amounts of serum samples. The sequence of the E1E2 region used in our cell-culture chimeric virus differed slightly from that used for the recombinant vaccine (Supporting Fig.  1) , with the greatest variations located in HVR1. At least part of the neutralizing activity in these serum samples has previously been shown to be directed against HVR1. 32 We did not observe significantly higher ID 50 titers using the HCV-1 HCVpp compared to the H77 HCVpp. We cannot exclude an interaction between HVR1 antibodies and EP-I antibodies during HCV-1 neutralization. It is possible that antibodies recognizing both regions do not act synergistically or additively and could compete for binding or neutralization given the position of the epitopes. Such analyses are complex, and, although important to understand the mechanism of HCV neutralization by polyclonal sera, they are beyond the scope of these studies.",

Given that EP-I and EP-II are adjacent to each other on the HCV E2 protein, the interference could therefore occur through steric hindrance that prevents binding of the EP-I-specific antibody or through conformational changes that are induced through binding to EP-II. Interestingly, structural studies have shown that both EP-II and EP-I could adopt different conformations, indicating a structural flexibility of these sites on the E2 protein. [41] [42] [43] This flexibility has been confirmed from crystal structures of the HCV E2, 44, 45 with complex structural interactions occurring between regions downstream of the E2 N-terminus encompassing the EP-I and EP-II regions. Part of the EP-II region has been shown to form part of a conformational epitope recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies, 11 and structural studies confirm that the epitope includes a portion of the CD81 receptor-binding loop, 44 which could account for some EP-II-specific antibodies exhibiting neutralizing activity. The presence of alternative conformations on the virion could change the specificity and/or affinity of antibody recognition at these two epitopes, thus constituting a strategy for HCV to evade humoral immune response.",

Through a number of analyses using samples depleted of EP-II-specific antibodies, we show a significant effect of these antibodies on the neutralizing activity of EP-I-specific antibodies in both HCVcc and HCVpp systems, supporting our previous hypothesis that antibodies to EP-II can interfere with the function of antibodies to EP-I.
