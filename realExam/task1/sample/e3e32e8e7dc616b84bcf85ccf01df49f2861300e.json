To assess the in vitro antiviral activity of swine intestine antimicrobial peptides (SIAMP) against IBV, 45 chick embryos were randomly assigned into 3 groups, 15 for each group. Embryos in group 1 were inoculated with IBV. Group 2 was inoculated with SIAMP-IBV intermixture. Group 3 was used as a control and inoculated with sterile PBS. Allantoic fluid was collected for hemagglutination titer assay. In addi-tion, weight gain, mortality, and pathological changes for each group were recorded. The results showed that no distinct pathological changes were found in chick embryos after they were inoculated with SIAMP-IBV intermixture and the mortality was reduced remarkably compared with the IBV-infected group. Weight gain of embryos in the SIAMP-IBV intermixture group was significantly higher than the IBV-infected embryos (P < 0.01), which was also higher than the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the hemagglutination titer in the SIAMP-IBV group was significantly lower than that in the IBV-infected group (P < 0.01).

In 1989, Lee and coworkers first reported the isolation and purification of SIA-MP cecropin P1. Its molecular weight is 3,339 Da and it is highly sensitive to Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Actinomycete, and pyesis Streptococcus (Lee et al., 1989) . Subsequently, another antimicrobial peptide, PR-39, characterized a 31-residue antibacterial peptide with activity against E. coli K12 and several other gramnegative bacteria and was isolated from swine intestine (Agerberth et al., 1991) . Recently, a 78-residue antimicrobial, NK-lysin, was purified from pig small intestine; NK-lysin showed high antibacterial activity against E. coli and Bacillus megaterium and moderate activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Andersson et al., 1995) . More recently, we have isolated a novel SIAMP and demonstrated that the molecular weight of this peptide was 5,972 Da (Wang et al., 2009) . To our knowledge, little work has been conducted on the antiviral activity of SIAMP. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of SIAMP on the anti-IBV infection of SPF chick embryos. The avian coronavirus IBV is a major economic pathogen of domestic poultry that, despite vaccination, causes mortality and significant losses in production (Harrison et al., 2007) . Our results confirmed that 36 h postinoculation, the embryo began to die. The dead embryos were observed runting, curling, and misshaping, with compression of feet overhead. This is consistent with a previous report about the pathological changes caused by IBV (Escorcia et al., 2002) . Interestingly, we found that the embryos in the SIAMP-treated group were normal, and no evident difference was present compared with the control. Furthermore, the mortality induced by IBV was reduced remarkably after embryos were pretreated with SIAMP. These findings suggested that when embryos were pretreated with SIAMP, the infectivity of IBV was reduced. This may be explained by the fact that preincubation with peptides may prevent viral fusion to target cells and reduce the IBV infectivity.
