            "text": "Oncolytic viruses constitute an emerging strategy in immunomodulatory cancer treatment. The first oncolytic virus, Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), based on herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2015. The field of oncolytic virotherapy is still in its beginnings, since many promising viruses remain only superficially explored. Influenza A virus causes a highly immunogenic acute infection but never leads to a chronic disease. While oncolytic influenza A viruses are in preclinical development, they have not made the transition into clinical practice yet. Recent insights into different types of cell death caused by influenza A virus infection illuminate novel possibilities of enhancing its therapeutic effect. Genetic engineering and experience in influenza A virus vaccine development allow safe application of the virus in patients. In this review we give a summary of efforts undertaken to develop oncolytic influenza A viruses. We discuss strategies for targeting viral replication to cancerous lesions and arming them with immunogenic transgenes. We furthermore describe which modes of cell death are induced by influenza A virus infection and how these insights may be utilized to optimize influenza A virus-based oncolytic virus design.",

            "text": "The observation of viral infections leading to the reduction of cancerous tumors was reported throughout the 20th century 1,2 . The first report of a complete tumor remission in the context of an influenza A infection dates back to 1904 3 . Preclinical models solidified the assertion of oncolytic effects of influenza A viruses 4, 5 . However, the lack of understanding of virus biology made a safe and effective development of oncolytic A viruses impossible at that time. In the last decades advancements in molecular virology and viral engineering led to the clinical development of a variety of oncolytic viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) 6 , reovirus 7 , vaccinia virus (VV) 8 , vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 9 , adenovirus 10 , newcastle disease virus (NDV) 11 , measles virus (MeV) 12 and picornaviridae 13 . This renewed interest in oncolytic viruses resulted in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of the first oncolytic virus, Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), in 2015 6 . T-VEC is an HSV, which is modified to grow selectively in tumor cells and express the immunostimulatory transgene granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The development of oncolytic viruses was based on conditional replication of prototype viruses in malignant tissue, while being attenuated in normal tissue 14 . The lytic effect of the virus was initially thought to be the main principle of their anti-cancer activity. Later it turned out that the therapeutic effect was mainly promoted by a pro-inflammatory stimulation of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) counteracting tumor-associated immunosuppression. Thus, the concept of virotherapy largely overlapped with the rational principles of immune checkpoint inhibiting antibodies [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Importantly, the combination of oncolytic viruses with checkpoint inhibitors appears to be highly beneficial in a number of preclinical models [23] [24] [25] . In this line, a seminal paper by Zamarin et al. indicated , that an oncolytic NDV sensitized an immunologically \"cold\" murine tumor to systemic checkpoint inhibitors, which increased the rate of tumor remission 23 . Similarly, combining T-VEC with immune checkpoint inhibitors was associated with complete remission in 22% of stage IIIB/IV melanoma patients in a small phase I study strongly supporting this concept 26 . Those observations prompted a high level of interest in the field of virotherapy.",

Specifically, caspase 3 appears important for viral replication 44 . In this line, the influenza A virus can actively induce apoptosis. Apoptotic signaling may be initiated intrinsically through the viral protein PB1-F2 45 . A further major inducer of apoptosis during influenza A virus infections is the viral nucleoprotein (NP), interacting with the host's Bcl-2associated X protein (Bax) inhibitor clusterin, leading to Bax induced apoptosis 46 . Extrinsic induction of cell death, which inhibits viral replication at a late stage of viral life cycles, has been reported to occur through the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor ligands, depending on nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-\u03baB) activation 47 . This process is counterbalanced by NF-\u03baB inactivation through NS1 48 . The viral surface glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) can also be involved in induction of cell death, as it enhances apoptosis through activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) 49 .",

Overall, there seems to be a fine, time-dependent balance of pro-and anti-apoptotic stimuli, which are tightly controlled by the virus. Upon overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules influenza A virus titers are reduced due to viral RNA-protein complexes being retained in the nucleus 43, 50 . Interestingly, caspase activation has been shown to enable diffusion of nuclear proteins into the cytoplasm 51 . This suggests that inhibition of both apoptosis and innate anti-viral responses through NS1 is necessary for viral propagation, especially in the initial phases of infection. In the late phase, activated caspases are needed to release viral RNA from the nucleus (Fig. 2 ). This theory is further reinforced by the observation, that the anti-mycotic amphotericin B enhances influenza virus growth 52 . Amphotericin B stabilizes pores within cellular membranes. This mechanism has been shown to aid RNA particles in passing through different cellular compartments 53 and might also enable viral RNA release from the nucleus.",

With respect to cellular innate immune mediators, NS1 was shown to inhibit interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-\u03baB 48, 68 . Since NS1 deleted influenza A viruses are capable of inducing strong PKR pathway upregulation, it seems plausible that known downstream signaling might lead to calreticulin (CALR) exposure on the cell membrane 69 .

Full NS1 deletion results in viruses characterized by an abortive infection.

Correspondingly, we observed that partial NS1 deletion to 80 or 116 remaining amino acids (AA; removing the effector domain, but leaving the RNA binding domain and one nuclear locating sequence) induced an optimal balance between attenuation and the oncolytic effect 61,73,74 .

In this line, we and others have demonstrated, that NS1-deletion viruses can be employed to stimulate dendritic cells (DC) to mount a T cell response against malignant cells via cross presentation 85, 86 . Stimulation of T cells can either be induced by DCs exposed to delNS1 virus generated virolysates or by exposing DCs infected with delNS1 viruses to tumor cell lysates. Again, partial NS1-deletion viruses were more effective than full deletion of the NS1 protein. Those ex vivo assays might somewhat model the in vivo tumor microenvironment during oncolytic therapy. Exposure of immune cells to oncolytic NS1 deletion viruses was also shown to induce direct IFN dependent cytotoxic effects of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs), including T cells, B cells, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells against various cancer cell lines 87 . These cytotoxic effects might contribute to the viruses' therapeutic effect in the tumor microenvironment.",

Thus, the presence of trypsin or equivalent proteases in the tissue is substantial for host restriction. It restricts the influenza A virus infection to the lung, the enteric system and for some viral isolates to the brain. We discovered that various colon cancer cell lines express trypsin and allow oncolytic influenza A virus growth in the absence of exogenous protease 73 . To further target the influenza A virus to tumor tissue we generated a virus in which the conformational change of HA, which enables viral entry, relies on the protease elastase 74 . Elastase has been shown to be present in tumor tissue due to expression by neutrophils. Elastase is also strongly expressed by malignant cells of pancreatic origin. Replacing the trypsin cleavage site with an elastase cleavage site has been shown to attenuate influenza A virus replication in swine and mice [88] [89] [90] . We therefore exchanged the trypsin cleavage site within the partially NS1 deleted (116AA) PR8 influenza virus to elastase. Elastase-dependent viruses yielded a potent therapeutic efficacy in murine melanoma (B16) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PANC-1) xenograft models 74 . Thus, this attenuation marker present in HA can be used to target virus to tumor tissue and might allow for the use of HA which is currently not present in the human population, including the H7 or H9 subtypes.",

This happens due to the emergence novel reassortments as well, as novel mutants, generated by genetic changes caused by viral polymerases characterized by a low fidelity. Therefore, the use of the virus as a therapeutic agent requires specific safety attention. Any oncolytic virus candidate needs to be tested for its stable attenuation. The existence of licensed live influenza A virus vaccines clearly indicates, that the genetic stability of attenuated live influenza viruses is feasible. We could demonstrate that delNS1 viruses, including armed versions, can be safely passaged for more than 5 times, without losing their transgene or phenotype 83, 92 . Moreover, expressing a transgene from a truncated NS1 reading frame within the NS segment, which codes for the attenuation marker at the same time, prevents the unwanted transmission of the transgene to a wild-type virus (Fig. 4) . This is particularly desirable, since reassortment of the chimeric segment with wild-type segments of other influenza virus subtypes might lead to an unexpected pathogenic phenotype. Thus, in case transgenes are expressed within a wild-type segment, the apathogenic character of such chimeric viruses may need to be proven within the background of various subtypes.",

This can be achieved by arming the virus with a proapoptotic cytokine such as interleukin-24 (IL-24). We have shown that IL-24 sensitizes cancer cells to apoptosis within the background of an influenza A virus infection 98 . Importantly the apoptotic effect of IL-24 was strongly dependent on a second signal, namely the activation of the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) by viral RNA. This dependency targets the strong induction of apoptosis achieved by IL-24 to the tumor microenvironment, as the attenuated influenza virus used in this experiment cannot replicate otherwise. However, an influenza virus armed with IL-24 might be difficult to translate to clinical studies, due to IL-24 inhibiting viral growth and leading to low production titers 99 .",

Necroptosis is a form of programmed death a cell may engage in as an alternative to apoptosis depending on abundance of caspases and various signaling proteins within the cell. It is dependent on receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) activation and subsequent membrane lysis through mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) activation. This leads to a phenotype resembling necrosis. Necroptosis is considered to be highly immunogenic due to passive release of a large variety of DAMPs and cancer neo-antigen 101 . A recent report implicates necroptosis signaling through RIPK3 in inducing potent anti-tumor immune responses independent of the subsequent necrotic phenotype induced by MLKL and DAMP release 102 . Influenza A virus infection can be sensed by the cell through Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1). This can lead to either necroptosis or apoptosis 103 .

This is usually correlated with worsened prognosis 112 .

            "text": "A novel pathway of regulating immunogenicity in viral infections is oxeiptosis 113 . Viruses like influenza A virus generate radical oxidative species (ROS). Cells can sense ROS through Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) which produces a dose-dependent effect 113 . At low doses of ROS the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is activated by KEAP1 and promotes cell survival 113 . Also, KEAP1 binds to PGAM family member 5 (PGAM5), and consequently inactivates it. At higher doses, KEAP1 dissociates from PGAM5, leading to induction of oxeiptosis, a caspaseindependent, immune-silent form of cell death 113 . Engaging in this type of cell death protects the cell from undergoing more immunogenic forms of death like necroptosis. PGAM5 knockout mice were shown to react to influenza A virus infection with enhanced necrotic histology and rapid death 113 . A malignant tumor might protect itself from ROS induced immunogenic forms of cell death through intact oxeiptotic signaling, which potentially reduces the effectiveness of oncolytic viruses. Downregulation of oxeiptotic cell death in the tumor microenvironment may be a promising strategy to enhance oncolytic virotherapy.",

Therefore, coinjection with such an agent may lead to intensified initial growth and enhanced subsequent reactions against the tumor. Oncolytic viruses have been combined with multiple agents in preclinical studies, like histone deacetylase inhibitors or the HER2 antibody trastuzumab 116, 117 .

HA seemed particularly important in deciding cell fate in this experiment. These results indicate that choosing influenza A virus vectors according to their capability to initiate necroptosis is a promising strategy for future oncolytic virus design. The influenza A virus NS1 protein can directly cause necroptosis through interaction with MLKL 111 . This form of necroptosis may be inferior to upstream pathway activation, since RIPK3 is necessary for strong immunogenic responses to necroptosis in cancer",
