            "text": "Type I and type III interferons are important anti-viral cytokines that are massively induced during viral infection. This dynamic process is regulated by many executors and regulators for efficient eradication of invading viruses and protection from harmful, excessive responses. An array of innate sensors recognizes virus-derived nucleic acids to activate their downstream signaling to evoke cytokine responses including interferons. In particular, a cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I (retinoic acidinducible gene I) is involved in the detection of multiple types of not only RNA viruses but also DNA viruses. Accumulating findings have revealed that activation of nucleic acid sensors and the related signaling mediators is regulated on the basis of post-translational modification such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation and ADP-ribosylation. In addition, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated as a new class of regulators in innate signaling. A comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of innate sensor activation and its signaling in host-virus interaction will provide a better therapeutic strategy to efficiently control viral infection and maintain immune homeostasis.",

It is thought that this factor must be 'interferon', which was found as a result of a study about interference against viruses by Drs Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957 (2) . Expression of the genes for type I and type III interferons is massively induced in response to viral infection, and the produced interferons evoke anti-viral activities through their binding to specific receptor complexes to induce multiple interferon-stimulated genes. With the remarkable progress in the studies of innate immunity, much more attention was paid to interferons. Molecular sensor-mediated recognition of invading microbes is the first step of host defense against infection to activate the innate immune system. During viral infection, virus-associated molecular patterns-viral nucleic acids (RNA and DNA)-are mainly targeted by patternrecognition receptors (PRRs), including transmembrane-type sensors, such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR9, and cytoplasmic sensors, such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I; also called DDX58) and cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase). In most cases, these viral sensors trigger the gene expression of type I and III interferons to induce antiviral activities.",

            "text": "RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed and recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasmic space (12, 13) . In particular, RIG-I is a key cytoplasmic PRR for the detection of RNA viruses such as influenza virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and measles virus (MeV) that are widely known to be pathogenic in humans (14) . RNA carrying a 5\u2032-triphosphate modification (3pRNA) is an essential determinant for RIG-I recognition (15) . Ligand binding activates the ATPase activity to change the conformation of RIG-I. And then oligomerized RIG-I interacts with the mitochondria-associated adaptor protein, MAVS (also known as VISA, IPS-1 or Cardif), through its CARD domains, which is facilitated by both covalent and non-covalent interactions with K63-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains. This, in turn, culminates in activation of transcription factors such as IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB, leading to the activation of the downstream gene induction programs such as type I interferon induction (16) . Nucleic acid sensors inducing type I and type III interferons. During viral infection, virus-derived nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are mainly targeted by host nucleic acid sensors triggering the gene expression of type I and III interferons to induce anti-viral activities. As RNA sensors, TLR3 and TLR7/TLR8 sense viral RNAs on the endosomal or lysosomal membrane. RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed and recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasmic space. Other RNA helicases DDX1, DDX21 and DHX36 form an RNA sensor complex in mDCs. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) NOD2 also detects the RSV-derived ssRNA genome to activate the MAVS/IPS-1 pathway. In the cases of DNA sensing, TLR9 detects DNA containing the unmethylated CpG motif. DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) interacts with dsDNA and activates TBK1 and IRF-3 as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor. Cytoplasmic AT-rich dsDNA (B-DNA) is transcribed by host RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) into 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA), which becomes a RIG-I ligand. DHX36 and DHX9 intracellularly sense CpG class A and B, respectively, in mDCs. DNA-stimulated DDX41 and the ALR IFI16 interact with their adaptor protein STING. STING itself also serves as a sensor of CDNs such as bacterium-derived c-di-GMP as well as host-derived cGAMP generated by cGAS in response to microbe-and host-derived cytosolic DNAs. cGAS is a critical cytoplasmic sensor for the detection of both microbial and host DNAs. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway is now recognized as a major intracellular dsDNA sensing pathway. DNA-PK, Ku70 and extrachromosomal histone H2B are also reported to function as cytosolic DNA sensors. As for Ku70, only type III interferon is induced. LRRFIP1 functions possibly as a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor that dually detects both RNA and DNA. HMGBs also bind to both double-stranded and single-stranded immunogenic RNAs and function as universal sensors for nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses during viral infection. RIG-I was also shown to function as an innate sensor to induce anti-viral responses against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in human hepatocytes (17) . The 5\u2032-epsilon region of HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which is known to take a unique hairpin structure, is a target for the RIG-I-mediated sensing. In this case, type III interferons were predominantly induced in vitro and in vivo during infection with HBV genotypes A, B and C, in a RIG-I-dependent manner. In general, RIG-I signaling leads to both type I and type III interferon gene induction, but how this predominant induction of type III interferons during HBV infection occurs remains to be clarified. Since such type III interferon dominancy was also observed during HCV infection and upon treatment with a RIG-I ligand 3pRNA, human hepatocytes seem to have their own intrinsic mechanism to preferentially produce type III interferons. In relation to this, there is an interesting report showing that, in human nasal epithelial cells, type III interferons but not type I interferons are predominantly induced in response to several RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), MeV and mumps virus (MuV) (18) .",

This was supported by subsequent studies, showing that DAI has a role in type I interferon induction in human foreskin fibroblasts upon cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (32, 33) , although DAI does not seem to be essentially involved in DNA sensing in vivo (34) . Subsequently, it was reported that the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I was involved in the induction of the type I interferon response during DNA virus infection. AT-rich dsDNA is transcribed by host RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) into 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA, which becomes a RIG-I ligand to initiate the RIG-I pathway (35, 36) . In this regard, RNA pol III is an intracellular sensor of viral DNA.",

Among them, PARP-7, also known as TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin)-inducible poly(ADPribose) polymerase (TIPARP), was shown to be an important mediator to negatively regulate type I interferon production activated by RIG-I and other nucleic acid sensors in the innate immune system (90) . Tiparp-deficient cells showed significantly increased levels of IFN-\u03b2 production following IAV infection, which was accompanied with a marked suppression of viral replication. Further investigation revealed that TIPARP could ADP-ribosylate the TBK1 protein, a pivotal kinase for the interferon pathway, thereby suppressing the TBK1 kinase activity.",

            "text": "As its name suggests, TIPARP is one of the inducible genes that is expressed following exposure to dioxins, through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which was known to be a receptor for dioxins. Whereas AHR has been mostly studied in terms of its toxic effects on development, cell proliferation and immune responses, but a variety of endogenous metabolites have also been shown to interact with the receptor and are involved in the regulation of multiple biological events (91) (92) (93) . In this respect, treatment with an AHR antagonist CH-223191 enhanced the interferon response upon viral infection and 3pRNA stimulation, suggesting that constitutive AHR signaling activated by endogenous ligand(s), such as kynurenine, negatively modulates the type I interferon antiviral response to prevent excessive responses. These findings indicate that this negative regulation is based upon the post-translational ADP-ribosylation of the TBK1 protein mediated by AHR-induced TIPARP (90) . An endogenous AHR ligand, kynurenine, is synthesized via oxidation of tryptophan, which is catalyzed by tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1/2 (IDO1/2). Liver is one of the major places where this enzymatic process takes place by using TDO, which is known to be exclusively expressed at polyubiquitin through the UBL domains to enhance RIG-I-mediated anti-viral signaling. ISG15-mediated ISGylation of RIG-I reduces the cellular level of active RIG-I and suppresses its downstream anti-viral innate responses. ZAPS, which is a shorter form of PARP-13, functions as a potent stimulator of RIG-I-mediated anti-viral signaling through its interaction with RIG-I to facilitate RIG-I oligomerization and its ATPase activity for the activation of both IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB. PACT directly interacts with the CTD of RIG-I to potentiate the activation of RIG-I. DDX6 interacts with RIG-I and augments type I interferon gene induction. high levels in human liver (94) . On the other hand, the liver has large populations of specialized tissue macrophages (namely Kupffer cells) and DCs (95, 96) , which have pivotal roles in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immune responses and its subsequent adaptive immune responses. Therefore, it is important to regulate such innate signalingbased responses to maintain immune homeostasis in liver.",

Very recently, lnc-Lsm3b, a non-coding alternatively processed isoform of the protein-coding gene Lsm3, was shown to be induced by type I interferons and to inactivate RIG-I function at a late stage of the innate response (109) . This study provides a novel lncRNA-mediated negative feedback regulation of innate signaling to prevent detrimental, excessive inflammatory responses, wherein the self-lncRNA lnc-Lsm3b functions as a molecular decoy to occupy the RIG-I-binding sites and sequester RIG-I molecules to restrict the access of 'non-self' RNA. Interestingly, lnc-Lsm3b uses GA-rich motifs located at the incomplete pairing strand of the long stem structure to efficiently compete with non-self-viral RNA. lnc-Lsm3b contains a multitude of GA-rich motifs, compared to RIG-I-favored foreign ligands that contain specific sequences, such as polyU/ UC motifs or elements in viral genomes. Further structural analyses would reveal its detailed mechanism for the competition and how such RIG-I recognition of self-RNA stops the generation of the downstream signaling. A 5\u2032-triphosphate modification does not seem to be needed for lnc-Lsm3b to bind RIG-I.",

Knockdown of this gene leads to up-regulation of IFN-\u03b2 and interferon-stimulated genes such as IFIH1 (MDA5), DDX58 (RIG-I), MX1 and OAS1. Although it is still unknown whether lncRHOXF1 directly regulates the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and/or ISGs, it seems to function as a repressor of the viral response during development of human trophoblast cells (112) .",

IRF-3 is a transcriptional factor that is activated downstream of most of the nucleic acid sensors, and is critical for the induction of type I and type III interferon genes. HSV-1 inhibits the nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 and enhances the degradation of activated IRF-3, thus interfering with the pathway leading to IFN-\u03b2 production. Mechanistically, at least ICP0, which is known as an essential component of interferon resistance, was found to be necessary for preventing IRF-3 nuclear accumulation (128). An endogenous AHR ligand, kynurenine, is synthesized via oxidation of tryptophan, which is catalyzed by TDO and IDO1/2 in human liver and other organs. Constitutive AHR signaling activated by endogenous ligand(s), such as kynurenine, negatively modulates the type I interferon anti-viral response to prevent excessive responses. On the other hand, in the gut, some tryptophan metabolites such as kynurenine, IAld and I3S are generated by the bacterial catabolism of tryptophan, and act as AHR ligands to induce regulatory responses for the maintenance and function of ILC3 cells and the control of Treg and T h 17 differentiation.",

During viral infection, virus-derived nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) are mainly targeted by host nucleic acid sensors triggering the gene expression of type I and III interferons to induce anti-viral activities. As RNA sensors, TLR3 and TLR7/TLR8 sense viral RNAs on the endosomal or lysosomal membrane. RIG-I and MDA5 are ubiquitously expressed and recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasmic space. Other RNA helicases DDX1, DDX21 and DHX36 form an RNA sensor complex in mDCs. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) NOD2 also detects the RSV-derived ssRNA genome to activate the MAVS/IPS-1 pathway. In the cases of DNA sensing, TLR9 detects DNA containing the unmethylated CpG motif. DAI (DLM-1/ZBP1) interacts with dsDNA and activates TBK1 and IRF-3 as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor. Cytoplasmic AT-rich dsDNA (B-DNA) is transcribed by host RNA polymerase III (RNA pol III) into 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA (3pRNA), which becomes a RIG-I ligand. DHX36 and DHX9 intracellularly sense CpG class A and B, respectively, in mDCs. DNA-stimulated DDX41 and the ALR IFI16 interact with their adaptor protein STING. STING itself also serves as a sensor of CDNs such as bacterium-derived c-di-GMP as well as host-derived cGAMP generated by cGAS in response to microbe-and host-derived cytosolic DNAs. cGAS is a critical cytoplasmic sensor for the detection of both microbial and host DNAs. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway is now recognized as a major intracellular dsDNA sensing pathway. DNA-PK, Ku70 and extrachromosomal histone H2B are also reported to function as cytosolic DNA sensors. As for Ku70, only type III interferon is induced. LRRFIP1 functions possibly as a cytosolic nucleic acid sensor that dually detects both RNA and DNA. HMGBs also bind to both double-stranded and single-stranded immunogenic RNAs and function as universal sensors for nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses during viral infection.",

Caspase-12 is physically associated with RIG-I and up-regulates TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I, leading to the enhancement of type I interferon responses. Non-covalent binding of K63-Ubn to the RIG-I CARDs induces its tetramer formation for downstream signal activation. Ube2D3/Ubc5c and Ube2N/Ubc13 were also identified as essential Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2) for RIG-I activation. The Ube2D3/Ubc5c-Riplet pair promotes covalent conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to RIG-I, whereas Ube2N/Ubc13 preferentially facilitates production of unanchored polyubiquitin chains. On the contrary, K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by other E3 Ub ligases, such as c-Cbl/RNF55, RNF122, RNF125, CHIP and TRIM40, negatively regulates anti-viral innate responses.

IAV NS1 interacts with TRIM25, and leads to inhibition of TRIM25 multimerization and RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, thereby suppressing RIG-I signal transduction. NS1 also targets Riplet. Viral proteins that have a deubiquitinase activity, including a PLP from SARS-CoV, FMDV Lb pro (a shorter form of the leader proteinase of FMDV) and a KSHV-derived tegument protein ORF64, directly remove the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and suppress its activity. HCV-derived NS3/4A protease cleaves MAVS/IPS-1, resulting in a blockade of RLR-signaling. HSV-1 ICP0 inhibits the nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 and enhances the degradation of activated IRF-3. HIV-1 also targets IRF-3 for protein depletion, in which HIV accessory proteins Vif and Vpr mediate the ubiquitination and proteasomedependent degradation of IRF-3. In addition, HIV-1 PR targets RIG-I through the degradation of RIG-I.",
