However, sepsis is now the leading cause of maternal deaths in the UK accounting for 26 deaths between 2006 and 2008 and there has been an increase in death due to community-acquired b-haemolytic streptococci group A (BHSGA) (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes ) disease [ 1 ] . A literature review of 55 pregnancies with symptomatic Groups A streptococcal infection since 1966 recorded early onset septic shock in 91 % with a maternal mortality rate of 58 % but the mortality has improved to 32 % in recent years [ 2 ] . Furthermore, when toxic shock syndrome due to BHSGA (can also be caused by Staphylococcus aureus ) occurs during pregnant, it can have devasting consequences with multi-organ failure and a mortality of over 50 % in reported cases [ 3 ] .

Implantation, placentation and generally the fi rst two thirds of pregnancy represent a physiological condition analogous to an open wound that requires a strong in fl ammatory response.

Cesarean delivery does result in a surgical site, which may subsequently become infected, especially if certain risk factors are present, e.g. obesity and diabetes mellitus. There has been considerable interest in recent years in the surveillance of surgical site infections (SSI) following a variety of surgical procedures such as hip replacement as well as after Cesarean delivery as minimising SSI is an indicator of the quality of patient care. The incidence of SSI after Cesarean delivery can be up to 20 % but in healthcare systems where there is an emphasis on surveillance and infection prevention, the SSI rate is often less than 5 % [ 11 ] . Furthermore, the dissemination of surveillance results can result in reduced rates, even in the absence of active prevention measures. However, such preventative measures include the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis, typically with a cephalosporin, which should be administered prior to the surgical incision and which can reduce post-delivery maternal SSI by up to 50 % [ 12 ] . Most SSI after Cesarean delivery are relatively minor and not requiring critical care but severe cellulitis or even necrotising fasciitis (see Chap. 9 ), can occasionally occur, such as that due to group A streptococcal infection [ 2 ] . The recent history of post-partum infection, including endomyometritis, mirrors that of other infections in terms of the recent emergence of gram negative bacilli and antibiotic resistance.
