A common point of all past studies is, however, that there is only one peak of infected density in each single epidemic spreading episode. At variance, real data from different cities over the world suggest that, besides a major single peak trait of infected density, a finite probability exists for a pattern made of two (or multiple) peaks. We show that such a latter feature is fully distinctive of a multilayered network of interactions, and reveal that actually a two peaks pattern emerges from different time delays at which the epidemic spreads in between the two layers. Further, we show that essential ingredients",

            "text": "Epidemic spreading in networked populations has been studied intensely in the last decade, and a lot of great progresses has been achieved 1-4 which significantly increased our understanding. This is actually useful for public health authorities to assess situations quickly, to take and enforce informed decisions, and to optimize vaccination and drug delivery policies. Initially, the main attention focused on static networks, where each node represents an immobile agent and the contagion occurs only between neighboring nodes: it was remarkably revealed that scale-free networks display a vanishingly small epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic limit 5, 6 . After that, the focus shifted to reaction-diffusion models 7-10 , flow-driven epidemics [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , objective spreading 16, 17 and adaptive behaviors [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Finally, in a third stage, multilayered [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and temporal 33, 34 networks were assumed to play a critical role on such processes. A common feature in past studies is the use of phenomenological models which produce a single peak of infected density in each individual epidemic spreading. An interesting question is therefore whether or not all real evolutionary processes are conveniently represented by such a framework. A scrupulous analysis of a large number of real data from different cities over the world surprisingly shows that, besides a major pattern made of a single peak, there is a finite and non negligible probability for a new pattern of epidemic outbreak featuring two (or multiple) peaks. Notice that a two peaks pattern implies two outbreaks in a single spreading period, i.e. a secondary occurrence of the same epidemics, which may in turn produce severe calamities and disasters within unprepared populations. Understanding the underlying mechanism at the basis of this new pattern (with the help of a novel model extracted from real data) is therefore quintessential to properly cope with such life-threatening hazards.",

For this purpose, many countries have established their sentinel surveillance systems to collect epidemic data. For instance, Hong Kong Department of Health has organized a surveillance system, with the aim of collecting empirical data of infectious diseases, and of analyzing and predicting the trend of the infection. In such a system, there are about 64 General Out-Patient Clinics (GOPC) and 50 General Practitioners (GP), which form two distinct sentinel surveillance networks of the city 35, 36 . In these two networks, one obtains for instance the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness (per 1, 000 consultations), which reflect the overall influenza-like illness activity in Hong Kong. Fig. 1(a) shows the collected data from 1998/1/3 to 2014/8/2 in GP, while the corresponding data of GOPC is shown in Fig. 1 of the Supplementary Information (SI). From Fig. 1 (a) one see that there are many events of epidemic spreading, and the intervals between two consecutive events are not regular, indicating non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics 36 . On the other hand, one notices from Fig. 1 (a) that most of the outbreaks correspond to a single peak of infected density, which is the pattern well described by the classical susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) models. However, one notices also that there is a finite probability for a novel pattern of epidemic outbreak which features, instead, two or multiple peaks. Fig. 1(b) shows one of such patterns (with two peaks) occurring at around 2005/6, which indicates that an infectious disease raised two times during that epidemic period in Hong Kong. Such unexpected phenomenon also exists in the data from GOPC (as one can see in Fig. 1 of the SI).",

An interesting 7 question is whether the observed behavior corresponds to a critical phenomenon. To figure out the answer, we let \u03c4 be the time interval between the two peaks of \u03c1 I . In particular, the two peaks will merge into a single one when \u03c4 = 0. Similarly, we let \u03b4 t =| t B max \u2212 t A max | be the time delay between the two peaks in layers A and B, where t A max and t B max are the times of occurrence of the peak in \u03c1 A I and \u03c1 B I , respectively. The trivial situation would be that for which \u03c4 = \u03b4 t , but our numerical simulations show that this condition is attained only when \u03c4 is large, whereas one has \u03c4 < \u03b4 t when \u03c4 is sufficiently small. And, in particular, one has \u03b4 t > 0 when \u03c4 = 0. respectively. From Fig. 4 (a), one sees that when k ab is small, \u03c4 will decrease monotonically and be non-vanishing with the increasing of \u03b2 ab , indicating that the event of two peaks always exists in the pattern. However, when k ab is increased, \u03c4 will decrease rapidly to zero, implying that there is a critical \u03b2 c ab for different k ab . When \u03b2 ab < \u03b2 c ab , the epidemic spreading event occurs through a pattern of two peaks in the infected density, while for \u03b2 ab > \u03b2 c ab it occurs via the traditional pattern with a single peak. On its turn, Fig. 4 (b) shows that \u03b4 t decreases monotonically with the increase of \u03b2 ab for all the three cases of k ab , and it never vanishes. This is because the spreading speed is different in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Generally speaking, epidemic spreading is faster in heterogeneous network than in homogeneous network 42 .",

While the network heterogeneity decreases with the increasing of \u03b3, it is easy to see that when \u03b3 is large, \u03c4 and \u03b4 t decrease more prominently with \u03b2 ab . Specifically, the difference of spreading speeds between the two layers is not distinctive for large \u03b3, resulting in the disappearance of the two peaks.

For this purpose, we have also studied the case of SF-SF and RR-RR networks, respectively. Very interestingly, one finds that the pattern of two peaks can be still observed by adjusting the coupling strength between the coupled layers (see Fig. 7 in SI for details). On the other hand, extension to three-layered model was also considered, and it was found that there is a small probability to produce a pattern of three peaks (see Fig. 8 in SI for details). Therefore, while in principle one can expect a multi-peaks pattern to occur in a multilayered network, the majority of unusual cases (i.e. cases in which the epidemic event is not happening with a single maximum of infected density) will be characterized by just two peaks, in full consistency with the data of Fig. 1 .",
