This ongoing threat is caused by a virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 In Wuhan, China, the origin of COVID-19, where the first case was reported in December 2019. The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has spread Bangladesh has not experienced similar viruses such as SARS or MERS diseases until now, and public healthcare systems are not completely prepared for this epidemic. In Bangladesh, the magnitude and rapid proliferation of COVID-19 through slightly symptomatic or asymptomatic infected people show the need to identify the behavioral responses of the population. However, in Bangladesh, some unprecedented measures have been adopted by the government to control COVID-19 transmission. Different global actions plan has been put along with government activities. The response from the government has become more forceful by placing restrictions on gathering and closing educational institutions. 8 The government (Bangladesh Public Administration Ministry) has also announced the shutdown of offices with 30 days of general holiday from March 26 to April 25, 2020, placing restrictions on leaving home after 6.00 pm in the evening, and imposing legal actions on individuals leaving their dwellings after 7.00 pm, 9 development of isolation units, personal hygiene maintenance, isolation and care for infected people and suspected cases. Until now, out of 8, 5 divisions were partially and 3 were completely locked down to avoid contacting, and of the 64 districts 61 were either partially or completely locked down. 10 Besides, on 24 April 2020, the Ministry of Religious Affairs announced that to maintain physical distancing during Ramadan amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of people in mosques for evening prayers is restricted to twelve (12) (including senior clerics and other mosque officials), and individuals or institutions are not allowed to arrange or participate in any gathering over Iftar meals at dusk during the In Bangladesh, the fight against COVID-19 is continuing. People's adherence to these control measures is essential, which is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. 11, 12 There are a limited number of studies on knowledge and attitudes during epidemics that have been conducted in Bangladesh. However, the lessons learned from the studies conducted in other countries in an epidemic situation such as the SARS outbreak in 2003 suggest that knowledge and attitudes towards infectious diseases are associated with panic emotion among the population, which can further complicate attempts to prevent the spread of the disease. 13, 14 Suggestions from another study In Latin America, during the outbreaks of chikungunya, zika, and dengue reported low levels of participation and commitment to the imposed control measures in populations. 15 Knowledge of the disease is an important cognitive key in public health regarding health prevention and promotion. It involves a range of beliefs about the causes of the disease and exacerbating factors, identification of symptoms, and available methods of treatments and consequences. 16 Beliefs about COVID-19 come from different sources, such as stereotypes concerning similar viral diseases, governmental information, social media and internet, previous personal experiences, and medical sources. The accuracy of these beliefs may determine different behaviors about prevention and could vary in the population. In many cases, the absence of knowledge, or if most of these medical-related beliefs are actually false may carry a potential risk factor. 17 In Hubei, China, one of the first studies analyzing attitudes and knowledge about concluded that attitudes towards government measures to contain the epidemic were highly associated with the level of knowledge about COVID-19. 18 The authors reported higher the level of information and education was associated with more positive attitudes towards Covid-19 preventive practices. 6, 18 Perception of risk is also a key factor in commitment to prevention during outbreaks of global epidemics. 6, [19] [20] [21] [22] Knowledge of infection process precautions may be linked to citizens following government guidelines regarding prevention and quarantine measures. Numerous studies also reported level of knowledge directly affects the perception of disease susceptibility. 7, 21, 22 On the other hand, knowledge may also influence attitudes and practices. Attitudes are a motivational/emotional posture that prepares us to respond properly or not, in a specific context. In COVID-19 breakout, positive attitudes and good practices may mediate safe behaviors, prevention measures, and disease propagation. 23 It is notable mentioning that, despite the mandatory nature of public protective measures, the adherence to each of them is still poor among some populations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 223, "end": 224, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1052, "end": 1053, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1370, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1674, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2298, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2752, "end": 2755, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2756, "end": 2758, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2962, "end": 2964, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 3251, "end": 3253, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3720, "end": 3722, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3949, "end": 3951, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4102, "end": 4104, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4105, "end": 4107, "text": "18", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4214, "end": 4216, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 4217, "end": 4221, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4222, "end": 4226, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4227, "end": 4231, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4232, "end": 4236, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4493, "end": 4495, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 4496, "end": 4499, "text": "21,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4500, "end": 4502, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 4825, "end": 4827, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Considering the lack of studies related to epidemics and how to facilitate outbreak management of COVID-19 in Bangladesh, and hence there is an urgent need to understand the public's perception and awareness of COVID-19.
