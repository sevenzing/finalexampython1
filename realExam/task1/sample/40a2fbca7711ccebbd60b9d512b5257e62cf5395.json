These studies have also highlighted the value and importance of transparent data sharing across countries, which have enabled the live tracking of the disease widespread worldwide [9, 10] . The role of host genetics in impacting susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 has been less studied. Previous work has supported the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in susceptibility [11] and severity [12] for several viral infections. Moreover, a synonymous variant in the IFN-induced transmembrane protein-3 gene has been reported to cause severe clinical outcomes in patients infected with H7N9 and H1N1 influenza viruses [13, 14] , although results did not reach established P value thresholds (P < 5 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ). In addition, candidate variant studies have suggested host factors that are critical for severe disease in other coronavirus infections, such as infections due to the related SARS-CoV [15] .",

Do not share another group's results with other parties without permission 7. The initiative should not inhibit any work being done within any individual studies (or between pairs of studies). Studies that are interested in joining the initiative can register via the website 1 . We can categorize the participating studies in two main groups. Retrospective collections are typically biobanks with existing significant genetic data and active connections to health systems. In these studies, there is the opportunity to opportunistically and rapidly develop a genetic study on susceptibility and severity. For example, in Finland with the national network of biobanks covering each hospital district, it is possible to acquire almost 'real-time' updates on COVID-19 status of individuals that are already part of the FinnGen study 2 . This group of studies is already connected and loosely structured via other initiatives such as the Global Biobank Metaanalysis Initiative 3 .",

Few analyses that can benefit from maximal sample size are centralized. The primary analysis focuses on COVID-19 disease severity. There are challenges in defining COVID-19 severity across multiple studies and healthcare systems. We used a pragmatic approach which considers the use of invasive and noninvasive ventilation as an index of severity. The advantages of this approach is the possibility to easily retrieve this information from electronic health records and the widespread use of these procedures across healthcares. Studies that have collected detailed clinical information can perform secondary analyses using continuous markers of disease severity such as maximum respiratory rate during hospitalization or prior to invasive respiratory support.",
