Assessment of pandemic preparedness at the beginning of an outbreak is a strength. These data will serve as a baseline for future surveys and studies of NHs' experiences during this pandemic. In summary, while NHs in 2020 show greater pandemic preparedness than in 2007, they will face challenges due to limited PPE supplies and staffing shortages. NHs will need to refine their preparedness strategies as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves and is anticipated to have major consequences. For NHs to effectively prepare for a pandemic, real-time data and experiences should be readily available to help inform their response. The World Health Organization confirmed 93,090 cases of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19) worldwide on March 04, 2020. 3,198 deaths were declared (3%). In the United States, 108 cases were confirmed. 1 Coronavirus family members are known to be responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), associated with severe complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities and old age. 2, 3 In a recently published large case series of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infected pneumonia, the 36 patients (26.1%) transferred to an intensive care unit were older and had more comorbidities (median age = 66 years; comorbidities in 72.2% of cases) than patients who did not receive intensive care unit care (median age = 51 years; comorbidities in 37.3% of cases). 4 Comorbidities associated with severe clinical features were hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease, which we know are highly prevalent in older adults. Previously, the China National Health Commission reported that death mainly affects older adults, since the median age of the first 17 deaths up to January 22, 2020, was 75 years (range = 48-89 years). 5 Moreover, people aged 70 years or older had shorter median days (11.5 days) from the first symptom to death than younger adults (20 days), suggesting a faster disease progression in older adults. 5 Since COVID-19 seems to have a similar pathogenic potential as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 6 older adults are likely to be at increased risk of severe infections, cascade of complications, disability, and death, as observed with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections. 7, 8 The consequences of possible epidemics in long-term care facilities could be severe on a population of older adults who are by definition frail and immunologically na\u00efve towards this virus, even if the risk is of course for the moment mainly theoretical.
