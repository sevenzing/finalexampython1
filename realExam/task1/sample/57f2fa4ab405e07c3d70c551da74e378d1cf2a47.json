The understanding of RAS dysregulation due to this viral infection is of fundamental importance to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, and to design effective therapeutic strategies. To address this issue, we built a mathematical model of RAS based on data about protein and peptide concentrations in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We first tested our model on clinical data on the action of antihypertensive RAS-blocking drugs in control individuals. Despite the simplicity of our model, it reproduces very well, without any fitting of additional parameters, the impact of a series of drugs, i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), direct renin inhibitors (DRI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB). We applied our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the RAS system, which we modeled through a downregulation of ACE2 related to viral load. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of RAS-blockers and other RAS-targeting drugs, i.e. human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) and angiotensin 1-7 peptide (Ang1-7), on the RAS system of normotensive and hypertensive COVID-19 patients. We found that while ACE-I, DRI, rhACE2 and Ang1-7 tend to improve the clinical outcomes in a tension-dependent manner, the use of ARB appears to worsen it. The mathematical model that we developed offers the interesting possibility of testing in silico the RAS dysregulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and of predicting how risk factors as well as different drugs, alone or in combination, impact on RAS and disease severity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since December 2019, the world is facing a severe viral pandemic with millions of infected people and hundreds of thousands of deaths [1] .

The addition of this enzymatic reaction in the model does not really influence the predictions as it can basically be viewed as a reparametrization of ACE activity and of ACE-I action; moreover, this enzyme is only poorly expressed in the lungs of healthy individuals. It could nevertheless be interesting to add this enzymatic reaction yielding ACE-independent synthesis of AngII which, even though debated, has been suggested to be upregulated in case of long-term ACE-I administration [78] and to explain why ACE-I fails to inhibit AngII formation after some time [78, 79] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 205, "end": 209, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 823, "end": 827, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 902, "end": 906, "text": "[78,", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 907, "end": 910, "text": "79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion and Perspectives"}, {"text": "The second enzyme of which we overlooked the activity is NEP, which cleaves AngI to form Ang1-7.
