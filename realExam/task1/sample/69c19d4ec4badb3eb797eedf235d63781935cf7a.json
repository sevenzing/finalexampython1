Important efforts to speed adoption have mostly focused on changes in structure or educational interventions. It turns out that the field of jazz music was grappling with similar issues in the early 1960s. In this essay, we draw lessons from the experiences of jazz musicians during a time of transition. We conclude that significant cultural transformation, focused on two paradoxes, and the barriers and contexts that flow from them, will be necessary to achieve ideal interprofessional healthcare practice.",

            "text": "Over the last two decades, interprofessional collaborative practice has been increasingly embraced as an ideal model for the delivery of safe, high quality, and patient-centered healthcare. [2] There has been concurrent interest in interprofessional education, with articulation of core competencies by several international groups. [3, 4] At its best, interprofessional practice entails seamless communication across disciplinary boundaries, broad participation in and shared responsibility for healthcare decision-making among multiple professions, and high quality team-based practice. While these are laudable goals and have been demonstrated to foster a variety of positive outcomes, [5] [6] [7] [8] healthcare practice on the ground has been slow to evolve toward an interprofessional ideal. [9] Efforts to foster more rapid adoption have focused mainly on structurally-based barriers to interprofessional practice or educational deficiencies of practitioners. [10, 11] While both areas are important, we posit that additional issues lie at the heart of interprofessional practice, and will require significant cultural transformation before the ideal can be achieved. It turns out that the field of jazz music underwent a similar interprofessional transformation in the early 1960s. [12] In this essay, we examine two of the era's leading jazz groups as models of pre-and post-transformation practice, and identify lessons learned for today's healthcare environment. The jazz piano trio is one of the most fundamental and popular group formats, and consists of a piano, a bass, and drums. Piano trios can stand alone, or can serve as the backbone (called a \"rhythm section\") for larger groupings of instruments. One of the reasons that piano trios are ubiquitous is that the structure of the trio mirrors the structure of music itself. Music is generally regarded as being composed of three main elements: melody, harmony, and rhythm.",

Harmony provides context, and can make a given melody sound happy, sad, contemplative, or a wide range of other moods and feelings. Rhythm is responsible for creating the timing of a song, not only setting the pace, but also how the song \"moves\".

Most commonly, the piano takes the melody, the bass plays harmony, and the drums handle rhythm. This pairing of one instrument with one structural element can set up hierarchies within the trio, because audiences tend to focus on melody, making the piano seem like the most important instrument. It is not an accident that most piano trios are named for the pianist, and that the pianist often functions, or is seen to function, as the leader of the band. Since the instrument one plays forms a core component of the professional identity of the musician (just as specialties form the core of identity for health professionals), the primacy of melody over harmony or rhythm has implications for the interprofessional interplay among pianist, bassist, and drummer during a jazz trio performance.",

In this version, when the improvisational section begins around 1:15, the piano is not playing nearly as fast or as much as the previous version. However, many listeners perceive that more things are going on musically in this version. Scott LaFaro, the bassist, is all over his instrument, going high and low, playing snippets of melody, plunking occasional low harmony notes, and generally engaging in a back and forth exchange with the pianist. Meanwhile, the drummer Paul Motian is keeping a steady beat, but varying his accents to provide a kind of musical punctuation for the dialogue between the bassist and pianist. In this version, all three musicians seem to be attending to all three components of the music. The result is a more modern and complex sounding version, that, while less accessible at first, retains interest with repeated listening, because three sets of ideas, as played by three individuals, are unfolding in real time and having to be reconciled with each other. This stands in opposition to the Oscar Peterson Trio, with its one main set of ideas, voiced by the piano, and supported in predictable fashion by the bass and drums.",

All three instruments were now empowered, and all three were responsible for the integrity of the melody.

            "text": "In health care settings, there have been some success stories about empowering members of the team. One example is the elevation of physician assistants and nurse practitioners in primary care practices. Traditionally, such providers have functioned in a subservient role to the physician, for instance, having to \"sign out\" patients to the physician before they could be discharged from the clinic, or having to get prescriptions countersigned by the physician. In contrast, many modern primary care practices address patient care needs indistinguishably by physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. [15, 16] All engage meaningfully in the task of caring for a population of patients, analogous to all members of the Bill Evans Trio engaging meaningfully in the task of caring for the melody. Another example is the participation of physician assistants on surgical services, taking a lead role in the postoperative medical management of patients. [17] While such examples provide a beacon of hope for interprofessionalism, we note that structural changes in the sharing of tasks is only the beginning. decisions. For example, a common factor that empowers nurses to speak up the hierarchy to prevent a potential error is the existence of an informal relationship with the doctor making the decision. [19] The trust garnered by such informal relationships reduces fear of retribution, and also enables the person in a position of power to take advice more seriously. Second, on an individual level, persons who are more comfortable with uncertainty will be more able to engage in back and forth deliberation that does not fall prey to premature closure, thus enabling higher quality decisions. Finally, on a systemic level, organizational factors such as availability of resources, examples set by senior leadership, fairness of processes, and cultural norms can either foster or inhibit the ability of teams to deal with uncertainty. Systems that inhibit teams' ability to embrace and work with uncertainty will be less likely to foster flattened power differentials, and less likely to realize the full benefits the first paradox of interprofessionalism.",

In Waltz For Debby, one hears the bass going up and down, playing snippets of melody in the high registers, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and in between dropping down and hitting harmony notes. LaFaro's example showed bassists that they did not have to abandon the traditional role of the bass. In fact, they could take on additional roles at the same time.",

            "text": "In health care settings, during the early days of the Patient Centered Medical Home movement, a core expectation was that medical assistants, nurses, and physicians would \"function at the top of their license\" [20, 21] , implying that they could safely and meaningfully take on additional tasks that would promote optimal patient outcomes. For example, medical assistants in some practices now gather core historical information from patients, pend orders relevant to the chief complaint, document subjective and objective data, and provide patient education. Using protocols, nurses manage anticoagulation levels. Pharmacists manage diabetes medications and recommend adjustments based upon patient-generated data. Patients themselves gather data and adjust medication dosages for conditions like diabetes and asthma, based upon care team guidance. All of these are tasks that were previously considered only in the purview of physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Such new tasks exist in concert with the traditional tasks of these roles, and, when embraced, have resulted not only in improved medical outcomes, but also better patient and provider satisfaction. [22] [23] [24] Like the flattening of power, role transcendence can be difficult in health care, because of the factor of risk. By taking on additional roles, such as participating in decision making, a supporting player on a health care team is also taking on some of the responsibility for those decisions, and therefore incurring risk that comes with such responsibility. For example, a number of studies have identified the fear of malpractice litigation as a barrier to non-physician personnel assuming roles traditionally defined as residing in the purview of the physician. [25, 26] As with uncertainty, risk can be managed on relational, individual, and systems levels.",

The main argument was that the trio was creating chaotic music that would be less accessible to listeners.

Such a narrative is organized, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f clear, straightforward, and predictable. Much of the hero worship in the news during the COVID-19 pandemic follows this narrative. Unfortunately, the world works in messy, unpredictable, and chaotic ways, and team science over the past few decades has demonstrated that the most successful teams have leadership that is distributed, relational, and not necessarily always done by the physician. [28] [29] [30] In other words, on any given day in any given situation, any of a team's members can help it find success. The best teams, whether in jazz or medicine, organize their business and communication to maximize this potential by drawing upon the full complement of perspectives and strengths of their members. This requires embracing the paradoxes of power and role transcendence. Rather than creating chaos, embracing the paradoxes represents an alternate, more complex and nuanced way of responding to chaos already inherent in health care settings, and better draws upon the strengths that teams bring to medical care. [31] The central paradoxes of power flattening and role transcendence, and the barriers of uncertainty and risk, can provide an important frame to guide the development of interventions that function on relational, individual, and systems-based levels. For example, a number of existing interventions that aim to flatten power hierarchies through reducing uncertainty and risk are designed to work by targeting one or more of these levels. These include TeamSTEPPS and Medical Team Training Program communication processes (both relational interventions), [32, 33] checklists to verify important facts rather than assuming authoritative accuracy (a systems intervention), and critical language that enables all team members to speak up (an individual intervention), like the CUS mnemonic (CUS = I'm Concerned, I'm Uncomfortable, this is a Safety issue). [34] Concepts such as psychological safety [35] help support the development and evaluation of such interventions. [36, 37] It is our hope that a focus on the power and role transcendence paradoxes, their respective barriers of uncertainty and risk, and the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f relational, individual, and systems levels will empower new ideas and interventions that significantly enhance the quality of interprofessional practice across health care settings.",

[38] Work by multiple authors has demonstrated fundamental differences in how health care providers view interprofessional collaboration itself. For example, a discourse analysis of the interprofessional collaboration literature demonstrated not one, but two distinct conversations. [39] One conversation focuses on the utility of interprofessional collaboration to achieve improved outcomes, so that the ends justify the means, and is typically embraced by physicians and those in authority. Another conversation positions interprofessional collaboration as valuable in and of itself due to its emancipatory nature, affording all professionals with the respect, authority, and voice that they deserve. This second conversation most readily occurs among those traditionally in supportive roles (nurses, pharmacists, etc.). This difference is not just confined to the literature. A large survey of doctors and nurses demonstrated that not only did the two groups evaluate the quality of interprofessional collaboration differently, they defined the concept itself in different ways. [40] For health care culture to shift toward sharing power and responsibility, there needs to be not only tools and concepts, but also an acceptance of the need to promote the voices that have not been heard and to elevate those who have been made low by tradition. In other words, there needs to be a single integrated conversation.",

The flattening of power differentials in health care can be difficult, because cultural norms about power relate to the factor of uncertainty. Medical culture values reducing uncertainty through clear lines of control and hierarchical decision making. While a leader sharing power may render the path of decision making less clear, he/she/they also increase the amount and diversity of input into decisions, potentially drawing upon a broader base of evidence and perspectives. [18] The difficulty comes from the stress resulting from a perception of greater uncertainty. This uncertainty can be managed on three levels.
