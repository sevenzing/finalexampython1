We constructed two independent lung protein interactome to reveal the signaling process on receptor activation and host protein hijacking machinery in the pathogenesis of virus. Further, we test the functional role of the hubs derived from both interactome. Most hubs proteins were differentially regulated on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, the proteins of viral replication hubs were related with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection in the risk individual. Additionally, the hub proteins were closely linked with other viral infection, including MERS and HCoVs which suggest similar infection pattern in SARS-CoV-2. We identified five interconnecting cascades between hubs of both networks that show the preparation of optimal environment in the host for viral replication process upon receptor attachment.",

An increase in patient number increases the fatality rate because of non-specific treatment against SARS-CoV-2. Today COVID-19 became a serious threat in both developed and under-developing countries [4] . There is an urgent need to accelerate work on specific treatments to decrease disease, morbidity and mortality [5, 6] . Repurposing of existing drugs has been considered as an immediate remedy rather than waiting for a new molecule to pass through human clinical trials. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 screening at the early stage may benefit the vulnerable population with the risk factor of diabetes, hypertension [7] [8] [9] , and cardiovascular disease [10] . However, understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and host involvement will provide knowledge that guides towards developing biomarkers and drugs to treat this pandemic disease.",

SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes most structural proteins at 3' ORFs and non-structural proteins (nsp) at 5' end ORFs [8, 11] . The nsp proteins are categorized as nsp1-16, which plays a potential role in replicase / transcriptase activity whereas the ORFs at 3' encode nine putative accessory factors along with four structural proteins, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S) proteins [8, 11] . The envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S) proteins localized at vial surface suggested having host binding capacity. On host attachment, SARS-CoV-2 initiates the infectious cycle and undergoes RNA replication inside the host and assembles their substrate into their progeny virus. In general at the initial phase of the host binding, virus may create an optimal environment for its replication by interacting with the host proteins. Simultaneously, the host alters its gene expression to react against the virus for self-defense leading to the overexpression of inflammatory genes and cytokine storm [12] . Due to the viral genome complexity and 20% sequence dissimilarity with other pathogenic HCoVs [13] . Notably, the sequence variations at replicase complex (ORF1ab), envelope (E), spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) suggest the possibility of different mechanisms adopted by SARS-CoV-2 that brings the question of repurposing the existing drugs. The current knowledge of host molecular components utilization by the SARS-CoV-2 is still at an early stage compared with other known human infecting RNA viruses. Understanding the regulatory behavior will enhance our knowledge of the virus-host mechanism, which may through light on diagnosis and treatment.",

In a receptor-mediated network, the implementation of the MCODE algorithm was exempted for its limited number of nodes and edges, which by itself forms hubs. Hence, the interacting proteins for all four distinct receptors were considered as hubs for the receptor-mediated network (Fig 2) . All hub proteins were mapped to differential expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. Of 374 hub proteins from both the network, 76 were differentially regulated in primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) on SARS-CoV2 infection (RNA-Seq dataset GSE147507). For instance, eight differentially expressed hub proteins were noticed in the receptor-mediated network (S1 Table) .

We adopted a similar mining process to determine the relevance of hub proteins with lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema. Simultaneously, the relevance of hub proteins was tested in viral infections such as adenovirus, influenza, metapneumo, parainfluenza, respiratory syntical virus, rhinovirus, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These results suggest that 101 hub proteins have relevance to lung disease (S3 Table) , and 117 proteins were associated with the known viral infection (S4 Table) .

            "text": "We implement a comprehensive systems biological framework ( Fig.1 ) that utilizes a variety of datasets to illustrate the critical mechanism mediated by SARS-CoV2 in the lungs. Two independent lung proteins interactome were constructed. The first interactome termed as a receptor-mediated network that revealed the molecular interaction that mediates cellular and signaling processes on SARS-CoV2 attachment to the host. In the receptor-mediated network, ATP6V1A, AP3B1, STOM, and ZDHHC5 are the seed proteins localized at the host surface showed significant affinity to the outer surface envelope (E), spike (S), and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV2. On bounding with ATP6V1A, AP3B1, STOM, and ZDHHC5, the host activates multiple signaling and cellular events that demonstrated in the receptor-mediated protein network (Fig 3) . For instance, viral envelope (E) bound to the AP3B1 cell-surface protein that initiates the interaction with its neighboring proteins, AP1G1, AP1M1, AP3D1, AP3M2, AP3S1, AP3S2, ARF1, ARF6, ARRB1, ARRB2, BUB1, BUB1B, CLTC, and CSNK1A1. Similarly, spike (S) interacts with the ZDHHC5 that connects CLDND1, FLOT2, FXYD1, FYN, LRRC8A, and PIF1. Likewise, the SARS-CoV2 membrane (M) interacts with ATP6V1A and STOM host surface protein that signals 25 human endogenous proteins (Fig 2) . Each host cell surface proteins and it's interacting neighbors form a closed hub with no extensive interconnection with another hub. These hubs were pathways enriched that takes part in wide verities of molecular pathways that include endosome transport, vesicle-mediated transport, protein modification, regulation of cell cycle, immune response, kinase activity, signal transduction, protein metabolism, cell communication, energy and metabolic pathway, cell growth, and maintenance, regulation of nucleic acid metabolism. To our knowledge, most of this mechanism is very well connected with the viral pathogenesis machinery mechanism. Notably, at an early phase of surface attachment, the host initiates inflammatory signaling such as interleukin signaling (IL1, IL2, IL5, IL23, IL8), TNF receptor, and NF-kappa B signaling pathways that may initiate cytokine storm in lung cells [12, 16] . Simultaneously, the involvement of transcription and translational regulatory processes were noticed in the pathway enrichment of receptor hubs. These results suggest that on surface receptor activation host prepares an optimal environment in the host for the viral replication. The second lung protein interactome was named as viral replication machinery network. In this network, we demonstrated the complex interconnectivity of human endogenous proteome with nucleocapsid (N) and 23 non-structural SARS-CoV2 proteins. The viral replication machinery network conveys the utilization of host factors for SARS-CoV2 replication and self-defense mechanism. Using the MCODE algorithm, eleven hubs (S1-11Fig) were extracted from the viral replication machinery networks, which play a significant role in cellular and molecular mechanisms (S5 Table) . Further, mapping the differently expressed genes with the hubs showed approximately 20% of hub proteins were altered upon SARS-CoV2 infection (S1 Table) . This result confirms the hijack of host hub proteins and their molecular pathways for SARS-CoV2 machinery. Some hub proteins were proven linked to diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (S2 Table) . These results suggest that the SARS-Cov-2 alter and utilize the disease proteins for its replication machinery that may be the considerable cause for susceptibility, severity, and complication. Besides, similar observations were noticed while mapping hub proteins with proteins related to lung disease and other viral infections. On mapping, 101 hub proteins were shared between the lung diseases suggesting a common mechanism relating disease symptoms and/or vulnerability (S3 Table) . Also mapping with other viral infection dataset, 50 hub proteins of the replication machinery network have noticed in influenza virus infection (S4 Table) , which suggests SARS-CoV2 and influenza may have a similar mode of host infection machinery [17] .",

We identified crucial functional hubs that relate the mechanism on activation SARS-CoV2 attachment through receptor and subsequent utilization functional hubs for viral replication in the host. Enrichment analysis supports our hypothesis showed the common mechanism associated with transcriptional and protein translation processing activated upon in host attachment. Hub proteins showed linked with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease proteins that provide the clue for severity and susceptibility in the diseased population. The relationship between hub proteins with lung diseases like COPD, asthma, pneumonia establishes the likelihood of similar symptoms. Also, assessing the hubs with the reported proteins of other viral infection establishes the similarity in the mode of viral infection. Interestingly, we propose miR-124-3p, let-7g-5p, miR-133a-3p, miR-133b, miR-218-5p, miR-22-3p, and miR-506-3p from the genes of interconnecting proteins from its molecular pathways as a miRNA drug for SARS-CoV2. However, further work is needed to confirm its utility for clinical application. We believe our results will add knowledge to the existing information that may open up miRNA as a drug for SARS-CoV2 infection.",

Each dataset (SET-A and B) was mapped to the lung-expressed-gene database to confirm all regulatory and binding events occur in Human lung tissue.Lung Protein-Protein InteractionsFor SET-A and B, we collected human protein-protein interaction data usingHuman Proteinpedia (http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/), BioGRID (https://thebiogrid.org/), HPRD (https://www.hprd.org/), and Intact (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/) database. All collected interactions were mapped to the lung-expressed-gene database to construct human lung protein-protein interactome.Each protein interaction in SET-A and SET-B was considered if both the interactingproteins neighbors were expressed in lung tissue. Thereafter, SET-A was designated as a receptor-mediated network and SET-B was termed as a viral replication machinery network.Core regulatory hubsMCODE algorithm[15] was executed on the viral replication machinery network to decompose the large network into dense functional hubs with a minimum of three proteins in each hub. The derived functional hubs from the viral replication machinery network describe the core functional module of host influenced by the non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV2. Whereas in the receptor-mediated network, implementing MCODE algorithm was exempted because of its limited number of nodes and edges, which by itself forms hubs. The functional hubs of the receptor-mediated network exhibit the mechanism that activated upon SARS-CoV2 attachment to the lung surface",
