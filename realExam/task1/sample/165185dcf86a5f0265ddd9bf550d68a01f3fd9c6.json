In addition, psychosocial dysfunction may include decreased intellectual function, loss of memory, impaired concentration [7] , and a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) characterized by depression, anxiety, memory of pain, dyspnea, and nightmares [7, 8] .

This arrangement in two categories of increased airway resistance and decreased lung compliance follows the general law of motion of the respiratory system [10] , where the pressure applied to the lung (P APPL ) generates a flow of gas (V) that is opposed by the airways' resistance (R AW ) and that results in a change in lung volume (V T ) that is facilitated by the respiratory compliance (C): (24.1) where P APPL equals the sum of the pressure generated by the respiratory muscles (P MUS ), a negative pressure, and the pressure generated by the ventilator (P VENT ), a positive pressure. Thinking in these terms greatly assists the understanding of the mechanical phenomena of respiratory disorders and their interaction with mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by bronchial hyperreactivity and airflow obstruction. Asthma affects over 22 million adults in the USA, and it is the most common chronic disease of children [11] . Chronic inflammatory phenomena are responsible for the heightened production of mucous that contributes to increased resistance to airflow through the airways and may result in permanent structural damage (remodeling) associated with loss of lung function and reduced response to bronchodilator therapy [11] . Asthma exacerbations are generally caused by viral infections and are marked by dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and air hunger and objectively by a prolonged duration of expiration that is measured by a reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) and FEV 1 over forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) [12, 13] . Patients who have had at least one such episode may be defined as \"exacerbation prone\" and have an increased hazard to have further episodes and an accelerated loss of lung function [13] . These patientsabout 20 % of all asthmatics-are responsible for the bulk of hospital admissions, mechanical ventilation, and tracheal intubation and for the majority of healthcare costs associated with asthma. Some of the risk factors that lead an asthma patient to be exacerbation prone include ongoing cigarette smoking, exposure to environmental allergens, poor compliance with maintenance therapy, chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and nonmedical factors such as poor social support, lack of private health insurance, and unemployment [12] .",

This new endexpiratory pressure is commonly referred to as \"auto-PEEP\" or \"intrinsic PEEP\" (PEEPi) from its mechanical similarity to the PEEP set on a ventilator [17, 18] . Table 24 .1 shows a summary of the effects of PEEP vs. PEEPi, highlighting similarities and differences. PEEPi remains a difficult concept to assimilate because it is not immediately \"seen\" on the ventilator screen. Figure 24 .1 shows why that is the case and how to set the ventilator to detect PEEPi. Additional implications of PEEPi particularly regarding its effect on work of breathing that may hinder discontinuing ventilatory support are discussed in section \"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\"",

Limiting FiO 2 to 40-60 % through a Venturi mask generally prevents a further rise of PaCO 2 (Chap. 1). Occasionally, severe hypoxemia must be treated promptly with higher FiO 2 ; one must be ready to provide ventilation by manual mask-bag ventilation, through a laryngeal mask airway, or by intubating the trachea. Patients with signs of severe respiratory failure such as obtundation, shallow breathing, central cyanosis, and obvious fatigue must be promptly intubated to avoid progressing to respiratory arrest. Most patients with asthma exacerbation can be triaged to NIV in the form of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). Either modality is effective because it provides positive pressure to the airways and facilitates exhalation [18] . The added ventilation provided by BiPAP may be of use in cases of diminished ventilatory drive and severe hypercapnea.",

The principal challenge of ventilating asthmatic patients is the presence of increased resistance to gas flow in the airways. On inspiration, this may limit the size of tidal volume; on expiration, it may cause hyperinflation and PEEPi. The combination of high inspiratory pressures and severe hyperinflation poses a risk for hemodynamic instability and barotrauma; limiting the size of V T may prevent these life-threatening complications. Permissive hypercapnea uses small V T limiting hyperinflation and allows PaCO 2 to rise. With proper monitoring of arterial pH and hemodynamic variables, this strategy has been used safely in severe asthma [20] . A helium/oxygen gas mixture of 80:20 or 70:30 (\"heliox\") decreases R AW in obstructed large airways because helium is less dense than nitrogen. Heliox is most indicated for upper airway obstruction where the airway is reduced to an orifice through which the low density of helium works best. It has been used with success in severe asthma [21] , where the drawback is the inability to deliver high FiO 2 .",

Unique to COPD is the progressive destruction of elastic tissue compromising the ability of the lungs to recoil passively to FRC. Hence, the end-expiratory lung volume increases, and the end-inspiratory lung volume has to increase accordingly to maintain V T . At steady state, the respiratory system resets the process of ventilation at a higher lung volume causing chronic lung hyperinflation (\"barrel chest\" on physical exam). Hyperinflation has unfavorable consequences on the mechanics of breathing, because (a) inspiration has to start from a flattened diaphragm and a less efficient shape for contraction and (b) more energy has to be spent to overcome the PEEPi generated by the larger end-expiratory volume with each breath (see previous section \"Asthma\"). The stable COPD patient with hyperinflation compensates for the added load by slightly decreasing the minute ventilation and retaining bicarbonate (above), but has to spend more energy to overcome these unfavorable mechanics. This can be a fragile steady state; when a perturbation occurs from infection, trauma, or surgery, the COPD patient is at risk for acute respiratory failure.",

Figure 24 .1 shows how PEEPi can be measured at the bedside by occluding the expiratory limb of the ventilator, i.e., performing an end-expiratory hold maneuver. This provides a closed ventilator/patient system that equilibrates at a pressure close to the one in the hyperinflated alveoli, as long as the airways to those alveoli are not occluded. However, the expiratory hold maneuver is reliable only if the system is allowed some time (1-3 s.) to equilibrate, which requires a slow respiratory rate with no inspiratory effort during the maneuver. This unfortunately is not a common occurrence in the ICU, as opposed, e.g., under anesthesia, where patients are commonly paralyzed. In the spontaneously breathing patient, PEEPi can be measured with the aid of an esophageal balloon to measure pleural pressure [31] . Short of that, which is not routine practice, one can just detect the expiratory flow limitation by the inspection of the flow trace on the ventilator display. Normally, expiratory flow reaches a baseline of 0 flow before the start of the next breath; with flow limitation, the trace will be abruptly truncated at the start of the next breath without any visible baseline of 0 flow ( Fig. 24.1) .",

Distinguishing \"severe ARDS\" is important in the light of recent evidence that some treatment for ARDS that has not proven a tangible benefit in the overall population has improved outcomes in the specific subgroup of patients with severe hypoxemia (see later in this section). ARDS is an inflammatory syndrome that can arise within the lung from acute injuries such as pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and lung contusion, or from outside the lung, as a consequence of systemic sepsis, transfusions, burns, acute pancreatitis, etc. [33] . The incidence of ARDS in the US has been estimated around 75 cases every 100,000 individuals or 190,000 per year, with a mortality rate between 30 and 60 %, yielding about 100,000 deaths and about the same number of survivors each year [34] . Survivors of ARDS have received heightened interest in the past decade, which has provided new and robust information on their long-term outcome (section \"Introduction\") [6] .",

            "text": "The acute alveolar damage of ARDS is an intense inflammatory injury of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium provoked by cellular and soluble mediators from the causatory event [33] . Such injury damages the lung parenchyma with edema and disruption of the alveolar walls, extravasation of blood cells and plasma into the alveolar spaces, and thickening of the epithelial layer with deposits reminiscent of the hyaline membranes of the premature neonate. This initial phase is characterized by inhomogeneity of alveolar lesions with areas of edema, consolidation, or collapse next to areas seemingly normally aerated and others overdistended. This inhomogeneity, which became apparent with the introduction of lung computed tomography (CT) scanning [35] , is such that a pressure applied at the airway may affect areas that get recruited, areas that cannot be recruited, and areas that do not need to be recruited at all. Thus, mechanical ventilation can recruit some alveoli and damage others within the same breath. The balance of these two effects will determine the progression towards healing vs. exacerbating the existing injury (\"ventilator-induced lung injury\" [VILI]) [36] . In a later phase, the lung parenchyma is progressively occupied by inflammatory infiltrates, and edema is substituted by collagen deposition and remodeling (fibroproliferative phase) [33] . This phase, often overlapping within the same lung with the acute changes described above, results in the need for further increase in ventilatory pressures, possibly perpetuating the lung injury. From a gas exchange standpoint, both hypoxemia and hypercarbia occur. Hypoxemia is secondary to venous admixture (shunting and low ventilation/perfusion ratio) and responds erratically to increasing the FiO 2 . Recruitment of collapsed alveoli forms the core of treating hypoxemia in ARDS; optimal recruitment not only increases PaO 2, but optimizes lung mechanics and may limit VILI [36] . Hypercarbia is due to decreased pulmonary blood flow from vasoconstriction (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, inflammatory mediators), vascular occlusion, and remodeling [37] and results in dead space ventilation. High dead space ventilation may require high minute ventilation and may perpetuate VILI.",

In such cases, higher ventilatory pressures might have been the only way to avoid death (at least temporarily). With the advent of modern techniques of ventilation and improved critical care practice in general, the time was ripe for change. This happened with the demonstration that a V T of 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) decreased the absolute mortality rate of patients with ARDS by about 10 % [41] . The use of 6-8 mL/kg IBW V T has become standard of care of ventilating the ARDS lung, and a broader strategy of \"lung-protective ventilation\" has been developed [1, 36] .

In non-ARDS patients, such as immediate postoperative patients, or patients who are in the process of weaning from ventilatory support, such low V T may sometimes result in insufficient ventilatory support and promote atelectasis. \u2022 Having demonstrated the beneficial effect of a 6 vs. 12 mL/kg IBW V T does not forbid that in some patients 7 or 5 mL/kg would be best. In a heterogeneously injured lung (section \"Pathophysiology\"), the inspiratory pressure generated by a 6 ml/kg V T may or may not recruit collapsed alveoli and/or may damage inflated alveoli [42, 43] . Using a higher V T or applying other ways to increase alveolar pressure such as higher PEEP or a recruitment maneuver [44] may injure the lung. Using V T lower than 6 mL/kg may limit alveolar damage but may derecruit the lung and decrease V T to the point of needing the assist of additional means to rescue gas exchange [43] (section \"Extracorporeal Circulation\"). \u2022 Setting the best level of PEEP needs further definition. PEEP helps to maintain alveoli open throughout the respiratory cycle (as it occurs without PEEP under normal circumstances) and prevents expiratory VILI [40] . A number of ways have been suggested to identify the ideal level of PEEP to maximize recruitment and avoid overdistention. Constructing a semi-static P/V curve by insufflating the lung with increasing volumes (Fig. 24. 3) may accomplish this task, but it is cumbersome and imprecise [45] . Functional CT scan images allow discriminating between various degrees of alveolar inflation [43] but are currently limited to specialized centers. Alternatively, a bedside \"PEEP trial\" can prove useful. With the patient on volume ventilation exerting no or minimal spontaneous effort, PEEP is increased by, e.g., 2 cmH 2 O; for a set V T , the P PLAT is measured before and after the intervention; a decrease or no significant change of P PLAT indicates that recruitment has occurred; an increase of about the same as the increase of PEEP is insignificant, and an increase of more than 2 cmH 2 O indicates overdistention. The PaO 2 will likely increase or stay the same until severe overdistention occurs. The trial can continue by small increments of PEEP until signs of overdistention or untoward hemodynamic effects are detected; the trial should be repeated at least daily in early ARDS because the mechanics of the lung with acute injury change rapidly.",

O 2 toxicity is related to both FiO 2 and duration of exposure, but specifics on neither are available. Practically, it is sensible to limit FiO 2 to reach O 2 saturation above 90 % unless other factors limiting O 2 delivery are present, such as profound anemia or low cardiac output. The current focus on lung-protective ventilation tends to prioritize optimizing respiratory mechanics over avoiding O 2 toxicity. Most would agree that an FiO 2 of 60 % or less is desirable and that an FiO 2 of 40 % or less is safe.",

This effect lasts throughout the prone period and regresses over different time periods in the supine position [46] . The mechanisms are related to the gravity-induced distribution of lung lesions over a ventral-to-dorsal gradient (section \"Pathophysiology\"). When the patient is turned from supine to prone, the gravitational gradient is reduced but not reversed, resulting in a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation (Fig. 24.5 ). This new architecture is more apt to the recruiting effect of positive pressure, whether PEEP or recruitment maneuvers, improving gas exchange and respiratory mechanics [47] . When applied for prolonged periods of time in patients with the most severe level of hypoxemia, prone ventilation improves gas exchange, time on ventilator, and survival [48] . In patient A, a set inspiratory pressure will distribute fairly uniformly, moving a small tidal volume and likely recruiting some lung over the tidal insufflation. In patient B, the same pressure will deliver a similar tidal volume (same compliance), but recruitment may be minimal, because the majority of lung tissue, particularly the massive consolidation in the right lung, may not inflate at all, while the seemingly healthy lung that will receive the pressure may have no alveolar unit to recruit and may become overdistended during the tidal insufflation",

In the absence of spontaneous breathing, these modes are pressure controlled with various inspiratory times. With BiPAP, commonly used with NIV, spontaneous breathing at the low P AW may be supported by a set inspiratory pressure. With PCIRV, a longer inspiratory time promotes recruitment through an increase in mean airway pressure: (24.9) where T I is the set inspiratory time, T E the expiratory time, and T TOT the total cycle time. With APRV, V T occurs by releasing the high P AW for a short period of time to allow exhalation. Through spontaneous breathing, these ventilatory modalities may promote alveolar recruitment; in experienced hands, they can successfully optimize gas exchange in patients with severe ARF. However, at this time there is no evidence suggesting an additional effect on clinical outcomes. High-frequency oscillation (HFO) delivers very small V T 's at very high rates (3-15 per second or 3-5 Hz). Oxygenation occurs through the constantly inflated alveoli, and CO 2 is moved along through the airways by the small V T 's [50] . Ideally, this system provides gas exchange without the trauma of expiratory alveolar closure. However, HFO has failed to show any benefit other than increased PaO 2 in early and established ARDS when compared with a lung-protective strategy [51, 52] .",

The well-recognized adverse effects of neuromuscular blockade, including loss of neurologic evaluation and potential prolonged weakness, have limited the use of [46] these drugs (Chap. 12). However, recent data provide evidence of improved outcomes when muscle paralysis is used for short periods of time in the initial management of severe ARDS with refractory hypoxemia [58] . Patients that are chemically paralyzed must be appropriately sedated with a hypnotic or amnestic agent to assure unawareness.

A number of recent pandemics of influenza have generated numerous reports that helped characterize the salient epidemiologic and clinical features of ARF associated with influenza. The presentation is nonspecific, with the acute onset of cough and fever being the most consistent symptoms. A variable percentage of patients (depending upon the different viruses and the preexisting conditions) develop ARF and necessitate admission to the ICU and intubation and mechanical ventilation. The mortality has varied throughout the 10-year spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to avian influenza H7N9 [65, 71, 72] . The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and confirmed with viral isolation techniques. A chest radiograph is nearly always obtained and frequently shows a pattern of bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS. The therapy, in addition to antiviral drugs, consists of respiratory support with mechanical ventilation using the principles outlined above for ARDS. Of particular interest has been the use of extracorporeal methods of support as outlined in section \"Extracorporeal Circulation.\"",

It has been observed that patients undergoing enteral nutrition are often underfed during weaning because of interruptions; care must be taken to minimize such interruptions and/or feed at increased rates to compensate [79] .

Preventive actions against generalized weakness and muscle atrophy include recognition and treatment of infections, limited use of corticosteroids and muscular relaxants (particularly curare based), close control of blood glucose, and early mobilization.

A frequent cause of elastic load is pulmonary edema due to residual lung injury, hypoproteinemia, and volume overload, particularly in the presence of LV dysfunction or renal insufficiency. Induced diuresis is a common prescription in a ventilatory unit, and management of volume status, fluid, and electrolytes balances a related challenge. Elastic load can be offset by an increase in mean P AW [see Eq. (24.9)] and consequent recruitment. An attractive way to increase mean P AW is by the applications of periodic recruitment maneuvers with CPAP, BiPAP, or sighs [86] . Elastic load can also come from pathology of the chest wall, such as large pleural effusions, abdominal distention, and thoracic deformities due to trauma or surgery. Pleural effusions may contribute to increase elastic work of breathing and worsen gas exchange during weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, these effects may be often overestimated, because the effect of their drainage can be remarkably unrewarding [87] .",

On the contrary, reducing the load is generally feasible and can be monitored at the bedside by repeated measurements of respiratory mechanics. Pharmacologic treatments for both resistive and elastic ventilatory loads have been reviewed earlier in the chapter and include standard treatment of bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Surveillance of extra-respiratory pathology will also benefit. For example, myocardial ischemia may occur in patients with abnormal coronary physiology when increased O 2 consumption by the myocardium may occur during trials of decreased ventilatory support because of the need for extra oxygen consumption, and this may trigger acute myocardial dysfunction and pulmonary edema [88] .",

Once a low level of PSV has been reached, a SBT is performed once or twice daily, and, if passed, the patient is ready to be separated from the ventilator. \u2022 Progressive lengthening of unsupported breathing during assist-control ventilation ([AC], Chap. 26) mode, allowing assisted breathing but without progressive withdrawal. When judged appropriately by the clinician, the ventilator is removed. Supporters of this way of weaning claim superiority because it allows direct inspection of the patient without the confusing addition of PSV [91] . This method should allow shorter weanings (PSV would mask the ability to discontinue the ventilator earlier) and higher success rate (a low level of PSV would mask the inability to sustain unassisted breathing).",

This is a newly identified cohort of patients that remains in the \"system\" during and after their ICU course, generally mechanically ventilated or dependent on other invasive therapies such as renal replacement therapy or ventricular assist devices for heart failure. Discussion relevant to the care of the chronic critically ill can be found in Chaps. 62 and 63. The chronically ventilated patient tends to have high comorbidity and prolonged stays in acute and rehabilitation hospitals, with repeated setbacks that carry him/her back to a higher level of care. When mechanical ventilation lasts for a few months past the initial ICU stay, the rate of non-weaning approaches is 100 %, and the mortality at 1 year is as high as 75 % [75, 76] .",

The normal P/V relationship is nearly linear, with a compliance of approximately 80 mL/cmH 2 O. The ARDS relationship is moved to the right (lower compliance) and is sigmoid, indicating that compliance varies with lung volume. Lower and upper \"inflection points\" indicate segments of the curve at which the compliance changes; these two points suggest values of airway pressure to set the PEEP (lower) and the inspiratory plateau pressure (higher). The segment of the curve between these set PEEP and plateau pressure should have the most favorable compliance to ventilate the patient at (Reproduced with permission from Wolters Kluwer Health: Crimi E, Hess DR: Respiratory Monitoring.
