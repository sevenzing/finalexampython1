Since our challenge system was designed to result in equal viral exposure for all 50 shrimp in Group 1, the simplest explanation for the low viral load in the surviving shrimp is that they responded to the challenge dose by rapidly passing from the early stage of YHV infection (i.e., with pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei in the LOT) to the persistently infected carrier state showing LOS (i.e., without experiencing the acute or patent stages of YHD). The mechanisms behind rapid transition to the carrier state are currently unknown but could include factors ranging from shrimp capacity to prevent viral entry (into the body or cells) to factors associated with cellular and humoral defenses. It is unlikely that the surviving shrimp had experienced delayed exposure to YHV, leading to early stages of YHV infection that would have progressed to the acute and patent stages of disease with longer incubation. If so, they would have shown at least some YHV-1 pathology including immunohistochemically positive LOT and absence of immunohistochemically positive LOS.

In that case, production of the envelope protein vp28 appeared to be suppressed with time after challenge while the level of viral production remained unchanged. The indications were that the ability of these shrimp to tolerate viral infection might be related to control over viral envelope protein production by an unknown mechanism. Presumably, the lack of one or more envelope proteins would reduce the ability of the virus to spread within the host.
