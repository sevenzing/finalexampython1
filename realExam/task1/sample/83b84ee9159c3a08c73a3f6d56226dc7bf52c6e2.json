Overall 54 per cent of dogs were seropositive to CCV, 84 per cent to CDV, 70 per cent to CPV and 86 per cent to RV. The antibody titres obtained were analysed with respect to a number of different parameters including: age, sex, breed, vaccination status, exercise regime, diet, Liverpool district in which the dog resided and the presence of diarrhoea. The prevalence and titres of antibodies to CCV, CDV and RV appeared to be influenced by age, CDV by vaccination status, and CCV by the presence of diarrhoea; no other influencing parameters were found.",

As most of the published surveys on the seroprevalence of these four canine viruses took place some years ago or in other countries, a prospective survey to assess their current seroprevalence in urban and suburban family-owned British dogs was carried out, For CPV, it was of particular interest to reassess seroprevalence now infection has to a large extent stabilised in the population. For CCV, an assessment of current UK seroprevalence is important because of the possibility that vaccines may be developed in the near future. A number of demographic and other parameters which may influence the prevalence and level of antibody to these viruses were also examined.",

'kentyfour of these dogs presented with acute and chronic diarrhoea (15 dogs duration <1 week; five dogs 1 to 3 weeks; four dogs >3 weeks). A questionnaire covering a number of demographic parameters was completed for each dog at the time of sampling. Data requested for each dog included age, breed, sex, Liverpool district (ie suburban or urban) in which the dog resided, vaccination status (ever vaccinated, and up to date vaccination, ie, within the previous two years), diet, whether multidog household and type of exercise. Information was not always obtainable for all parameters in all cases. The influence of these parameters on the presence or absence of serum antibodies to each virus was investigated initially using 2 analysis. Interactive analysis was also carried out using two forms of log-linear modelling. Analysis of deviance (logistic regression) further investigated the influence of parameters on presence or absence of antibody, and regression analysis was used to examine the influence of parameters on actual antibody titres.",

Of the dogs with diarrhoea, only 27 per cent were seropositive to CCV compared to 58 per cent of the non-diarrhoea group suggesting that this group of dogs were susceptible to CCV at the time of clinical presentation and may have been undergoing acute CCV infection. However, diarrhoea mostly occurred in younger dogs whereas the highest seroprevalence to CCV was in older animals. Alternatively, other agents may have been responsible for the diarrhoea. Thus the higher prevalence of diarrhoea in unvaccinated animals might suggest involvement of CPV or CDV. Convalescent sera demonstrating rising titres would have enabled confirmation of these hypotheses, but in this type of first opinion, subsidised clinic such samples were unavailable. Parallel virus isolation and electron microscopic examination were carried out on a number of faecal samples (Tennant 1989) and CPV was isolated from 1/24 dogs with diarrhoea and from none of the control dogs: with CCV isolation studies faecal samples were unfortunately subject to storage problems.

Significantly more dogs vaccinated at some time to CDV had antibody compared to those that had not and similar findings were reported by Olson and others (1988) in Sweden. It appears that CDV vaccination, rather than widespread infection, plays an Our findings for overall prevalence of antibodies to these four enteric pathogens of dogs broadly confirm the findings of others for this type of pet dog hospital population, although a higher seroprevalence of CPV in vaccinated and non-vaccinated dogs was found than has generally been reported (Cartwright 1973 Olson and others 1988) . This may be because CPV infection has become more widespread since the earlier surveys were conducted. Of the various demographic parameters examined, breed, sex, exercise pattern, diet, multidog household and urban or suburban district, had no apparent effect on antibody prevalence. xz analysis suggested that age may influence the presence of antibody to CCV, CDV and RV, in that younger dogs were less likely to be seropositive. This finding was not confirmed by interactive analysis, but this may be due to the small sizes of the subgroups generated. The age at which seroconversion occurs depends for all four viruses upon the time of exposure to field virus and, for CDV and CPV alone, on time of vaccination. For CPV, the majority of dogs had antibody by six months of age, in contrast to CDV and RV where most dogs appear to encounter the virus, as demonstrated by seroconversion, after six months of age. For CCV seroconversion appears important role in inducing a significant level of seropositivity to CDV within a population. Also, vaccination, but not up to date, influenced the presence of CDV antibodies supporting the suggestion that CDV antibodies may persist for several years (Krakowka and others 1985, Olson and others 1988) .",
