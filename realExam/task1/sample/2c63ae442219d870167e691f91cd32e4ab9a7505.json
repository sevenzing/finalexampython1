This manuscript conducts a meta-analysis and a sensitivity study to answer the questions: What is the basic reproduction number? How long is the incubation time of the disease on average? What portion of infections are asymptomatic? And ultimately, what is the case fatality rate? Our studies estimate the basic reproduction number to be 3.15 with the 95% CI (2.41-3.90), the average incubation time to be 5.08 days with the 95% CI (4.77-5.39) (in day), the asymptomatic infection rate to be 46% with the 95% CI (18.48%-73.60%), and the case fatality rate to be 2.72% with 95% CI (1.29%-4.16%) where asymptomatic infections are accounted for.",

Moreover, COVID-19 data contain substantial errors in that the number of confirmed cases is considerably under-reported, which is attributed to two primary reasons. Insufficient test kits do not allow every potential patient with COVID-19-like symptoms to be tested, and there has been a good portion of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers who would never be tested and counted as confirmed cases. It is useful to understand the asymptomatic infection rate, defined as the ratio of the number of asymptomatic infections to the number of all infected cases.",

Undetected transmissions present a remarkable challenge for the containment of the virus and pose an appalling threat to the public health. To understand the drastically negative impacts of COVID-19 on the public health, it is urgent to investigate key features pertinent to the disease: How severe is the transmission? How long is the incubation time of the disease on average? How many infections are asymptomatic? And ultimately, what is the case fatality rate? To evaluate the severity of the virus spread, it is useful to estimate the basic reproduction number (denoted R 0 ), defined as the average number of cases generated by an infected individual in a population where everyone is susceptible to infection. If the basic reproduction number R 0 is larger than 1, the outbreak is regarded as self-sustaining unless control measures are implemented to mitigate the transmission. 2 Defined as the time from the moment of exposure to the virus until signs and symptoms of COVID-19 appear, the incubation time of a COVID-19 infected patient provides a useful measure for the disease development.

While multiple studies reported estimates of the case fatality rate, those estimates are typically higher than the true case fatality rate under the same conditions, which is attributed to the fact that a good portion of asymptomatic infections are not counted when estimating the case fatality rate. Our sensitivity study addresses this important issue and makes an adjustment to provide a sensible estimate of the case fatality rate.Compared with the estimated 3.34% case fatality rate obtained from the meta-analysis, our sensitivity study estimates the case fatality rate to be 1.8% with 95% CI (1.18%-2.43%) where asymptomatic infections are accounted for. Our studies reveal sensible estimates for the important quantities of COVID-19 by accommodating discrepancy effects associated with different studies such as the variability of the data collected from different populations at different time periods. With the evolution of the pandemic, the basic production number can greatly reduce as a result of the implementation of active measures to mitigate the virus spread. The estimation of the case fatality rate may be closer to the true case fatality rate because of the increase of the test capacity; more infected cases may be detected so the reported number of infections would be closer to the true number of COVID-19 carriers. Our results are useful in enhancing the knowledge of COVID-19. Though we focus on evaluating the basic reproduction number, the average incubation time, the asymptomatic infection rate, and the case fatality rate, other features, such as the time from symptom onset to hospitalization or to death and the morbidity rate of the disease, are also important and they are worth being estimated in a sensible way. The present investigations have limitations. Not all published results for the four measures are included in our study; we do not F I G U R E 5 Meta-analysis of the case fatality rate (in percent) together with the results reported in seven different studies and the results from the Princess Diamond cruise. CI, confidence interval include those manuscripts which reported merely a point estimate without the associated standard deviation or a 95% CI, because they do not allow us to decide a proper weight for the inclusion of the result. While reporting a single estimate of the average incubation time and the case fatality rate gives us an easy way to assess the impact of COVID-19, such measures marginalize the effects from the associated factors such as the disease severity, the patient's medical conditions, and age. With more studies available for categorizing the case fatality rate or the incubation time, it is useful to apply the metaanalysis to estimate those measures by stratifying the population based on the demographic and clinical characteristics. When data at the individual level are available, better estimates of key features for COVID-19 can be obtained and the pandemic trend can be more reasonably projected using statistical regression models. Finally, we emphasize that care should be taken when interpreting the estimates from the meta-analysis and the sensitivity analyses here. A meaningful interpretation should be coupled with the associated features of the individual studies such as the time window, the study subjects, the study design, and different measures of controlling the virus spread by different countries.
