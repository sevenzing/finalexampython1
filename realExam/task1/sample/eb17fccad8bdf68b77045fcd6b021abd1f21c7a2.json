[7] [8] [9] Despite the early evidence from China, countries vary in their medical systems and resources, cultures, the COVID-19 situation, and their restrictive measures, 10 and hence research can identify the predictors of mental health in individual countries to enable effective identification of mentally vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 crisis. 11 This paper aims to provide the first evidence of mental distress and its predictors among adults in Brazil during the COVID-19 crisis. Building from early research evidence on mental health in China and Iran, where the COVID-19 outbreak occurred earlier, 7, 8, 11 we explore several predictors of distress during the COVID-19 crisis in Brazil. In particular, we examine individuals' distance from S\u00e3o Paulo -the city most affected by COVID-19 in Brazil.
