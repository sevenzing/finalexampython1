However, we only found 2 cases of children who received PICU care, and none of the patients in this study died from the disease. The occurrence of mild illness in pediatric patients has no clear explanation. Possible explanations may be related to the published data from other outbreaks of coronavirus infection, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). It has been reported that children had a much milder and shorter course of SARS infection than adults, and only 3.3% of confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection were aged less than 10 years [14] [15] [16] [17] . Therefore, children with COVID-19 had fewer infections and much milder illness than adults, which may be a feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these findings need to be confirmed by large, well-designed studies. However, there were 2 critical cases aged about 1 year in our study. It is known that secondary bacterial pneumonia caused the majority of the deaths in pandemic influenza [18] . In our study, one case had relatively high level of CRP with negative blood culture, and another one had the normal level of CRP with positive sputum culture. It has been established that several factors contributed to the low prevalence of positive blood or sputum culture results in pediatric pneumonia [19] .
