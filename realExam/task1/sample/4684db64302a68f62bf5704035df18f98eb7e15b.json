The infection could remain in the upper respiratory tract and prevent other clinical complications in patients.",

            "text": "A very important previous result that has been reported by Cheng et al, is that the expression of ACE2 depends on age and sex as has been observed in rat lungs. There is a higher expression in younger animals and in females than in adults and males. 6 Then, it is foreseeable that higher ACE2 levels are present in lungs of children and young people than in adults and particularly in old men. This fact is in clear contradiction with the hypothesis that a high ACE2 expression could worsen the clinical symptoms of COVID 19 and that ACE2 inhibitors could be a treatment. On the contrary, a high expression of ACE2 in children, young people, and women would be coincident with the lower pathology and morbidity reported for COVID 19 in these groups of population. Genetic ACE2 polymorphisms could account for the morbidity in children and young people, and may be related to the variability in COVID 19 symptoms that are being reported in different populations worldwide. 7 In summary, ACE2 activators are able to avoid pulmonary fibrosis, 8 for example, xanthenone (XNT) or diminazene aceturate (DIZE) that is an antiparasitic drug mainly for veterinary use in cattle to treat trypanosomiasis. 9 Some medicines containing DIZE are commercially available, for example, Veriben\u00ae or Berenil\u00ae. XNT and DIZE promote the migration of CD 34 cells inducing vascular repair, effect mediated by Ang II. In addition, DIZE could improve the vascular and pulmonary hypertension, 10 alveolar remodeling, and other pathologies. 11",

Moreover, lung alveoli cells such as type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages express ACE2 and are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, that together with the lost of ACE2 activity seem to be responsible for the most worrying COVID 19 effects in the respiratory system, causing pneumonia and lung fibrosis.",

The ARBs move the Ang II signaling to the ACE2 activation. Thus, it does not seem desirable to discontinue those treatments in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3 The increase of Ang II by ACEIs or ARBs could be activating ACE2, maintaining it occupied with Ang II, delaying in some way SARS-CoV-2 binding, and gaining some precious time for the immune system response.",
