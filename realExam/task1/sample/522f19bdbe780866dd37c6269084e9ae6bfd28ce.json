At the same pace, supportive care for patients receiving cancer therapy has also evolved, allowing patients to safely receive the newest advances in treatment in both an inpatient and outpatient basis. The recognition of the role of infection control and prevention (ICP) in the outcomes of patients living with cancer has been such that it is now a requirement for hospitals and involves multidisciplinary groups. Some unique aspects of ICP for patients with cancer that have gained momentum over the past few decades include catheter-related infections, multidrug-resistant organisms, community-acquired viral infections, and the impact of the health care environment on the horizontal transmission of organisms. Furthermore, as the potential for infections to cross international borders has increased, alertness for outbreaks or new infections that occur outside the area have become constant. As the future approaches, ICP in immunocompromised hosts will continue to integrate emerging disciplines, such as antibiotic stewardship and the microbiome, and new techniques for environmental cleaning and for controlling the spread of infections, such as whole-genome sequencing.

[7] [8] [9] Guidelines for infection control and prevention (ICP) in patients with hematologic or oncologic malignancies are centered on recommendations for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients 10 and have typically been based on principles of hand hygiene, air quality, barrier isolation (eg, the use of gowns, gloves, masks, and eye protection, depending on the type of exposure), endogenous flora suppression by prophylactic antibiotics, and the prevention of device-related infections (eg, central venous catheters and urinary catheters). 11,12 An equally relevant aspect of ICP for patients with cancer is the recognition of higher rates of colonization and infections by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multidrugresistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB), and Clostridium difficile compared with the general patient population. 11,13,14 Well known risk factors associated with the transmission of these MDROs include: hematologic malignancy; neutropenia; frequent contact with the health care environment; multiple and/or prolonged hospitalizations; devices, including urinary catheters and central lines; as well as changes in the microbiome driven by the use of antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. [13] [14] [15] [16] The reported colonization rates by MDROs in various populations of patients with cancer are from 4.7% to 36% for VRE, 15,16 from 5% to 10% for MRSA, 17 from 7% to 18% for C. difficile, 18, 19 and from 3% to 29% for MDR GNB. 14,20-22 Moreover, intestinal colonization with VRE and extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBL) Escherichia coli has been associated with an increased risk ratio (RR) of developing bloodstream infection (BSI) with these organisms (ESBL BSI: RR, 4.5; VRE BSI, RR, 10.2). 22 Emerging disciplines, such as outpatient cancer care and the entailed infection control practices (including up-todate immunizations, community respiratory viruses, and prolonged shedding), 23 the role of antibiotic stewardship, 24 and the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for outbreak investigations, 25 have great applications in ICP for patients living with cancer. However, there is no clear consensus or guidance on the variety of ICP strategies; recommendations for these practices are mainly centeradapted. 26, 27 In this review, we discuss key aspects of robust, comprehensive ICP programs, not only for hospitals specialized in cancer but for all centers that care for oncological patients, including practical algorithms and new approaches and technologies for enhancing these practices.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 590, "end": 592, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 593, "end": 594, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 812, "end": 814, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 815, "end": 816, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1067, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1071, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1075, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1270, "text": "10", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2398, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2403, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2404, "end": 2408, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2409, "end": 2413, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2599, "end": 2602, "text": "18,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2603, "end": 2605, "text": "19", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2908, "text": "22", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3138, "end": 3140, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3215, "end": 3217, "text": "25", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3427, "end": 3430, "text": "26,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3431, "end": 3433, "text": "27", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1053, "end": 1061, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Washing hands remains the main transmission-based precaution for preventing the spread of pathogens, and it has been the foundation of every ICP program.

Notably, these recommendations do not restrict fresh fruits and vegetables. 47 Stricter restrictions are usually applied for stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients and neutropenic patients with an absolute neutrophil count below 500 cells/mm 3 and include avoidance of raw fruits and vegetables, undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk and cheeses, and well water from private or public wells. 48 However, there is no clear evidence that strict dietary restrictions are associated with a lower risk for infectious complications. Two recent studies have questioned the value of a neutropenic diet. A randomized study in 150 pediatric patients who were receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy in which groups were assigned to either a neutropenic diet or US Food and Drug Administration-approved food-safety guidelines found no difference in the prevention of infections. 49 In fact, a retrospective evaluation of 726 patients at Northwestern Memorial Hospital reported a higher rate of infections in HCT recipients who followed a neutropenic diet compared with those who consumed a general hospital diet. 50", "cite_spans": [{"start": 215, "end": 219, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 220, "end": 224, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 225, "end": 229, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1044, "end": 1046, "text": "48", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1520, "end": 1522, "text": "49", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Dietary Principles"}, {"text": "Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly followed in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors who receive myeloablative therapy and develop profound neutropenia as well as in patients in the early post-transplant period.

The type and frequency of screening MDROs and the audience to which screening is directed varies among institutions owing to differences in patient populations, including high-risk inpatient groups, prevalence, and these measures also can change in an outbreak setting. 13,74 How often patients need to be screened is a matter of debate and depends on the type of organism and the center (Fig. 2 ). Other unanswered questions include the screening modality and the target organisms. The recent Society for Health Care Epidemiology of America (SHEA) guidelines highlight the benefits of screening for VRE colonization 75 ; consequently, several institutions such as ours perform rectal screening for VRE in the hematologic services and intensive care units, both on admission and once a week. 11 Data are less clear between ESBL carriage and subsequent infections or outcomes, or the benefit of screening for MDR Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB). 76 Recent publications suggest the need to screen patients or travelers from regions with high endemicity of MDR-GNB, such as the Middle East and Asia, or regions with recent outbreaks. 68 Recommendations are clear, however, that, once MDROs are detected, hospitalized patients should be on contact precautions to prevent horizontal transmission or hospital spread. 11,20 Most recommendations to reduce the transmission of MDROs in hospitalized patients involve a bundle of best practices, including hand hygiene, active screening of patients with swabs for cultures, contact barrier precautions, enhanced environmental cleaning, decolonization in the case of MRSA, and antimicrobial stewardship. 20, 68 Some practices, such as antiseptic whole-body washing or bathing of patients, have been shown by some researchers to reduce VRE and MRSA colonization and infections in hematologic units [77] [78] [79] and have been proposed by some for selected patients with recurrent MRSA soft tissue infections. 80 However, this impact has not been reproduced in other studies. 81 Interestingly, in a recent report, the use of a chlorhexidine wash was associated with an increased risk of infections caused by MDR-GNB, including carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae, 79 as well as the development of reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine and the presence of efflux-mediated resistance genes in staphylococci. 82 Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria Gram-negative organisms can develop resistance to blactams or carbapenems and many other antimicrobials, including quinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins. The most common MDR-GNBs are ESBL-producing organisms, MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR-Acinetobacter spp., and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A recent systematic review on the transmission of MDR-GNB showed that the hospital water environment was a key factor for transmission of MDR-GNB and for nosocomial infections, including clonal spread of MDR-Klebsiella spp., 83 which has been linked to several nosocomial outbreaks. 35, 84 Active surveillance for MDR-GNB in patients without signs or symptoms of such infections is not recommended, except in the situation of an outbreak or infections with high prevalence at a specific ward or unit. However, in cases of outbreaks or a high prevalence of MDR-GNB, the application of bundle interventions can be effective as part of infection control measures in intensive care units. 85 A multifaceted intervention in an oncological intensive care unit, including hand hygiene, contact precautions, and patient screening upon intensive care unit admission and weekly thereafter, along with environmental cleaning, resulting in a sustained decrease of MDR-Pseudomonas infection and colonization 86 ; however, the effectiveness and sustainability of these best practices in the long term are still undetermined. 86 Vancomycin-resistant enterococci VREs usually are not highly pathogenic and tend to cause more colonization than infection. However, in a recent meta-analysis that included adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with VRE infection, VRE was associated with an increase in hospital mortality, even in a nonimmunocompromised population. 87 VRE colonization rates in HCT recipients are 6% to 40% at admission, and VRE colonization has been associated with an increased risk for VRE BSIs. 88, 89 In patients with hematologic malignancies, active surveillance for VRE by rectal swabs on admission and weekly thereafter, with subsequent isolation if the patient is VRE-positive, has been shown to decrease the incidence of VRE nosocomial infections by decreasing rates of nosocomial transmission. 15, 16, 75, 89 Clostridium difficile Collateral damage from antimicrobial use includes alterations in the normal intestinal microbiota, creating the right environment for C. difficile infection (CDI). 41, 42 Several studies have demonstrated that the risk for C. difficile is higher in HCT and solid organ transplant recipients than for other hospitalized or surgical patients, particularly in the setting of graft-versus-host disease, given the potential for damage to the gut luminal mucosa and the need for additional immunosuppression. 14,18 Incidence has been estimated between 5% and 27%, with higher rates in patient after HCT. 14 Environmental contamination by C. difficile spores plays a major role in horizontal transmission to patients and subsequent infections. 90 Certain strains of C. difficile that are known to hypersporulate have been linked to several outbreaks. 91 Therefore, patients with C. difficile should be placed under contact precautions; all personnel should wear gowns and gloves, whether or not they anticipate touching the patient's environment. Hand washing with soap and water and thorough cleaning of all potentially contaminated surfaces with a 1:10 dilution of concentrated sodium hypochlorite are recommended and may reduce the environmental burden of C. difficile. 92 A multicenter survey to determine the rates of CDI in patients with cancer and in HCT recipients assessed isolation practices and found great variations across all centers. Most centers kept patients on isolation until the resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms, but few centers did so for the entire duration of hospitalization. 93 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 212, "end": 214, "text": "67", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 467, "end": 469, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 602, "end": 604, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 830, "end": 832, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 849, "end": 851, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 857, "end": 859, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 878, "end": 880, "text": "73", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1605, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1933, "text": "76", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2117, "end": 2119, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2634, "text": "68", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2821, "end": 2825, "text": "[77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2826, "end": 2830, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2831, "end": 2835, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2933, "end": 2935, "text": "80", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2999, "end": 3001, "text": "81", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3190, "end": 3192, "text": "79", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3334, "end": 3336, "text": "82", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3917, "end": 3919, "text": "83", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3979, "end": 3981, "text": "84", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4377, "end": 4379, "text": "85", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4687, "end": 4689, "text": "86", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4803, "end": 4805, "text": "86", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 5140, "end": 5142, "text": "87", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5290, "end": 5293, "text": "88,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 5294, "end": 5296, "text": "89", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 5596, "end": 5599, "text": "15,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5600, "end": 5603, "text": "16,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5604, "end": 5607, "text": "75,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 5608, "end": 5610, "text": "89", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 5797, "end": 5800, "text": "41,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5801, "end": 5803, "text": "42", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6370, "end": 6372, "text": "90", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 6477, "end": 6479, "text": "91", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 6899, "end": 6901, "text": "92", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 7233, "end": 7235, "text": "93", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1374, "end": 1381, "text": "(Fig. 2", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Multidrug-Resistant Organisms and Clostridium difficile"}, {"text": "Respiratory viral infections can cause high morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer.

The presence of these catheters is associated with increased risk for BSIs. 134 CLABSI is a surveillance definition used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Health Safety Network as follows: recovery of a pathogen from a blood culture (a single blood culture for an organism not commonly present on the skin and 2 or more blood cultures for an organism commonly present on the skin) in a patient who had a central line at the time of infection or within 48 hours before the development of infection. CLABSIs also must meet the following criteria: 1) the patient has a recognized pathogen culture from one or more blood cultures, and the organisms cultured are not related to an infection at another site; and 2) the patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms within 24 hours: fever, chills, and hypotension. 135 Furthermore, in 2013, the National Health Safety Network and the CDC added a definition for CLABSI that applies to patients with hematologic malignancies and/or HCT recipients: mucosal barrier injury laboratory-confirmed BSI, which is defined by either only an intestinal organism or only viridans group streptococcus; by allogeneic transplant within the past year with grade 3 or 4 graft-versus-host disease, or more than a single liter of diarrhea, or neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count below 500 cells/mm 3 within 7 days of the positive cultures. 136, 137 In recent studies, the reported catheter-related infection rate in adults with cancers was from 0.02 to 3 per 1000 catheter-days, 138 and the incidence of exit-site infection ranged from 1.9% to 60.9%. 139, 140 Risk factors reported for CLABSI in patients with cancer include thrombosis, difficulty during the insertion procedure, total parenteral nutrition, neutropenia, age, hematologic malignancies, and HCT. 138, 141, 142 The central venous port has grown in importance in cancer centers because of its advantages over central venous catheters, including the reduction of contamination of the device by external or skin pathogens, with an incidence of port-related infection that varies between 0.9% and 5.4%. 143, 144 Compared with the incidence of CLABSI for tunneled lines (hazard ratio, 1.77; P .011), nontunneled central venous catheters have a higher incidence of infection (hazard ratio, 3.50; P < .0001), 142, 145, 146 with the exception of peripherally inserted central catheters, in which the incidence rate of infection has been low, between 0.5 and 0.95 per 1000 catheter-days. 147, 148 In terms of site, CLABSI is generally more common when catheters are inserted in the femoral veins and, probably to a lesser degree, in the internal jugular veins compared with the subclavian veins. 149, 150 The most commonly reported causative pathogens in catheter-related infections remain coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Candida spp. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 19% of CLABSIs reported to the CDC and for 21% of CLABSIs reported to the Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 151, 152 Because bacteria can enter the catheter through migration of skin organisms, the most common etiology of CLABSI is the contamination of the hub by hand manipulation or blood products. 134, 153, 154 Thus aseptic techniques during catheter insertion, specialized \"intravenous teams,\" and postinsertion care bundles are best practices that have been shown to decrease the rates of CLABSI, especially for short-term catheters. [155] [156] [157] In addition, recognized postinsertion practices that reduce the rates of CLABSI include the use of chlorhexidine gluconateimpregnated dressings, 158 assessment of the insertion site, change of dressings weekly or as needed, scrubbing the hub for 15 seconds or more before access, clot prevention strategies, continuous reevaluation of the need for the catheter, 134, 159, 160 and the use of an antiseptic barrier cap using alcohol-impregnated port protectors. Regarding the barrier cap, 2 recent studies demonstrated a 34% reduction in hospital-wide CLABSI rates. 161, 162 Further modalities for the prevention of CLABSI, especially for long-term catheters, include: 1) catheters impregnated with minocycline-rifampin 134, 163 ; and other antimicrobial and antiseptic preparations 164 and 2) lock solutions containing minocycline and ethylene diamine tetraacetate (M-EDTA), 165 or ethanol locks. 166 The use of ethanol locks lessens concern for antibiotic resistance compared with antibiotic-coated catheters or antibioticbased lock solutions 165, 167 ; however, concerns about protein precipitation with ethanol locks warrant further studies before these locks can be routinely recommended.
