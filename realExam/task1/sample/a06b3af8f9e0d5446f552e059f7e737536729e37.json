We found odds of death varied across specific types of preexisting morbidities included to generate cardiovascular system diseases category. For instance, in the cardiovascular system diseases category, the odds of mortality were found CI: 2.53-4.24), than for COVID-19 disease patients with pre-existing arrhythmia (OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.96-4.57.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "35, 36], higher D-dimer level [37], and higher C-reactive protein [38]. These increased parameters lead to multiple organ failure [39, 40], severe pneumonia, hypoxia, respiratory failure, myocardial damage, and circulatory failure [18]. These non-communicable diseases independently elevate the risk of death and increase further if patients are infected with COVID-19 disease [21, 40-42]. COVID-19 disease also damages patients' myocardial cells by destabilizing coronary plaque in preexisting cardiovascular conditions and previous history of myocardial infarct [43, 44]. Similar higher risks of mortality were reported among SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients with cardiovascular diseases [41, 43, 45, 46]. These two diseases are considered as ancestors of current COVID-19 disease, which were reported in 2003 and 2012, respectively [41, 43, 45, 46]. Evidence also validates that the occurrence of influenza, along with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, could increase the risk of death [47, 48]. Pooled likelihoods in this study provide evidence of higher deaths among COVID-19 disease patients who had preexisting chronic respiratory diseases or any type of cancers. Chronic respiratory diseases like COPD and asthma are well-established risk factors for pneumonia [49], which also increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 disease infection [50]. Once patients are infected with COVID-19 disease, these further affect the patient's respiratory system and progress to severe hypoxemia [51]; therefore, the cumulative effects lead to events of death [18, 50]. Cancer patients are more likely to report a systemic immunosuppressive state and progress to severe clinical events, such as require intensive care (ICU) or death [52, 53].

These could independently elevate the risk of death and add to the adverse effects on the human body being infected with COVID-19 disease. Together, these increase occurrences of deaths. Moreover, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and reduced albumin levels are found to be associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 disease [21, 58], which can be caused by chronic liver and kidney diseases [58-62].
