Three variants of the architecture have been proposed, which incorporate: individual MEP/MEPM for each slice, shared ones for multiple network slices and Distributed Autonomous Slice Management and Orchestration (DASMO) approach. Each variant is focused on efficient integration of 5G Core and MEC solutions and utilizing additional functionalities of both components, including MEC APIs and 5G Control Plane exposure capabilities. Finally, main issues of 5G-MEC implementation have been discussed, which include the aspects of MEC service APIs, MEC Apps mobility in demanding use cases, challenges of service continuity in roaming scenarios as well as the role and availability of 5G enablers.",

Despite considerable facilitation provided by MEC, such as application deployment close to UE or mobility procedures enabling migration of applications to other hosts for maintaining low latency, the current status of MEC concept development raises significant concerns. This paper discusses the issues of MEC in terms of integration with sliceenabled, stand-alone 5G System (5GS). Such integration has already been described by ETSI; however, it seems that this approach to integration of MEC with NFV and slicing-enabled 5G network is over-complex. It is hereby proposed to use a different way, by removing duplicate functionalities of both solutions and integrating the information provided by network slice instances (NSIs) control message bus and MEC APIs. It is also proposed to integrate the approach with In-Slice Management (ISM) concept. The paper concerns not only the architectural alterations but also a discussion of mechanisms of MEC and 5G for their reciprocal integration.",

Deployment of multiple slices within MEC raises fundamental questions concerning performance, isolation and slice awareness. According to [3] , to enable safe operation, slice awareness of MEC Applications Orchestrator (MEAO) and virtualized MEPM (MEPM-V) as well as isolation of each slice (in case of shared MEP/MEPM approach) have to be ensured.

The framework follows the paradigm of hierarchical multi-domain orchestration and supports tenant-oriented operations and interfaces based on embedded in-slice managers. In [9] the internal structure of slices has been further defined -the core part of slice, consisting of functions composing the Application (AP), Control (CP) and Data (DP) Planes (A-VNFs, C-VNFs and S-VNFs, respectively), is accompanied by two special functional blocks: Slice Manager (SM) and Slice Operation Support (SOS), both implemented as sets of VNFs (M-VNFs and S-VNFs respectively), belonging to slice template and sharing the life cycle of their slice.

All VNFs have their EMs (symbolized by red dots) connected to OSS/BSS (red arrows). In case of MEC Apps, their management functions may be embedded in applications, externalized or nonexistent. VNFs and their EMs are also connected to VNFM(s) (single-or multi-VNFM options are possible, cf. [11] ), which are responsible for LCM of both MEC Apps and other VNFs (VNFM* in Fig. 2) .

As MEP/MEPM-V are dedicated, they can be a part of the template of virtualized 5G network and share its life cycle. In case of Variant 2 (suitable rather for short-lived and simple slices), they will be external to 5G networks (now consisted of AP, CP and DP only).

Centralized management of highly distributed networks is vastly inefficient, especially due to necessity of transporting of huge volumes of data needed for analysis, decision-making and execution of automated management processes. The DASMO architecture faces this problem. The single-domain scalable MEC-enabled slicing architecture (DASMO extended with MEC) is presented in Fig. 3 . All VNFs of the slice have their own EEMs, as it is required by the DASMO concept. EEMs are connected to SM, to provide the slice management plane communication. MEP/MEPM-V belong to the SOS area, because their role is in line with the SOS definition, especially the exposure of transparent mechanisms for slice VNFs interconnection. MEAO and User app LCM proxy are located in SM, because it plays a role of slice OSS.",

Moreover, slice services are generally limited and they rarely change during slice lifetime. The observations have led to the conclusions that it is possible to use many simplifications of MEC and slicing-enabled 5G network integration. The main value of MEC in the context of network slicing is the set of APIs, especially RNIS, Localization and Application Mobility API.
