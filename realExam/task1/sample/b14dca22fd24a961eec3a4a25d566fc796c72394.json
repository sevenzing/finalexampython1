The scale and complexity of projects such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), based at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, also require very long timelines. The first discussions of what eventually became the LHC happened in the late 1970s, but the proton beams didn't start to circulate inside its 27-km-long tunnel until 40 years later. The LHC is scheduled to operate for another 15 years, but to ensure continuity in this field, the time to start planning the future of particle physics is now.",

In the run-up to the launch of the LHC in 2008, the priority was obvious: find the Higgs boson. Its discovery in 2012 marked a culmination of the efforts of thousands of physicists, technicians and engineers and, by the time the first update of the strategy came around in 2013 1 , it also provided a very successful demonstration of the LHC's capabilities. However, as the excitement of the discovery faded, attention moved to the LHC's successor. By the time of the next update, it was decided, \"Europe needs to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN\" 2 .",

Other than a few not-statisticallysignificant hints (2-3\u03c3), there have been no signs for new physics beyond the Standard Model. A tangible sense of anxiety now pervades the community as it ponders its future -one that is perhaps amplified by the turbulent political times that we live in -and opinions differ on how to proceed.",

In their Perspective, Eva Sicking and Rickard Str\u00f6m discuss the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), a high-luminosity electron-positron collider that would rely on a novel linear accelerator concept. The construction and operation of CLIC is envisaged in three stages, starting at energies of a few hundred GeV and eventually reaching the TeV range. Such energies would enable precision measurements of the Higgs boson and the top quark, in addition to searches for new physical phenomena.",

At first, the FCC would operate as an electron-positron circular collider at different collision energies, but could then be upgraded to a proton-proton machine running at a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. The interplay of the two stages would open up a broad spectrum of Higgs and electroweak measurements.",
