There is a global effort to overcome this by combining the most effective use of existing PPE in combination with innovative strategies to produce more.

Epidemiologically these were linked to a seafood market in the city and on January 7, 2020 the causative organism, a novel coronavirus (now termed SARS-CoV-2) was identified 1 . In March 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic 2 , which has gathered speed across the world despite increasingly more drastic non-pharmacological interventions (NPI's) to limit its spread. With a quarter of the world's population now living under some form of government mandated lockdown, and over three million documented cases worldwide, NPI's are the main public health measure that policymakers are using to reduce viral transmission 3, 4 . Social distancing aims to flatten the curve of new infections, thereby avoiding a surge in demand on health care systems, but these effects may take weeks to months to manifest. Epidemiological modelling has shown that the pandemic could last for 12 to 18 months and that social distancing may need to continue until a vaccine has been developed 3 .",

In response to the shortage, there are reports of healthcare workers resorting to procuring their own PPE 85 . The recognition by the WHO and others, that the current global stockpile of PPE is inadequate to meet not only the current need but also future escalating demand 13 has resulted in multiple changes to PPE guidelines published around the world, including PHE, who have been criticised for basing guidance on availability of resources rather than maximising safety of healthcare professionals 86 . The most recent changes, dated 17 th April 2020, include PHE suggesting three options if we run out, including sessional use of PPE, reusing it or using alternatives to standard PPE 87 .

In reference to GMC's best practice of \u2017making the care of your patient your first concern', Sokol 105 Guidelines for rationing of PPE should follow the scientific evidence and also be morally defensible. A utilitarian approach where the greatest good for the greatest number is promoted, provides a valuable ethical framework and is intuitively scientific as it focuses on the consequences, as being the morally significant entity. It is scientifically justifiable to provide maximal PPE for the higher risk procedures such as AGPs. Some clinicians are better placed to treat COVID-19 patients than others. A utilitarian approach would support protecting these people who could provide the most benefit. Other clinicians may be offered lower levels of protection or their work activities reduced to limit the demand on PPE supplies. To limit certain activities is acceptable, however, to discriminate between clinicians would be a difficult moral calculation and likely to cause considerable distress 106 .",

However, in the case of rationing PPE, these decisions should be transparent, collaborative, accountable and adaptable as evidence of the pandemic evolves, rather than disguised as guidelines with the minimum level of protection. Changes in guidelines should be communicated honestly and clearly to the public and frontline healthcare professionals without political spin or ambiguity. Making morally sound policies is equally as important as following the scientific evidence to maintain trust, solidarity and a functioning society. Until there is a vaccine or proven treatments available the requirement for surgeons to limit their workload and take sensible precautions is imperative in reducing transmission, flattening the curve, protecting themselves and patients and reducing the death toll.

A study has also shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA of sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, suggested that strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of staff in isolation wards 27 . Other than AGPs, the risks of transmission include the fumes released during surgery and contaminated body fluids. Due to the novelty of COVID-19 there is no definitive evidence to quantify the risks of transmission via smoke derived from open or laparoscopic surgery, however there is enough evidence based on previous studies to support steps being undertaken to manage the potential risks 28 . Electrocautery creates particles with the smallest mean size of 0.07 m, with laser tissue ablation generating larger particles with a mean size 0.31 m and the largest particles generated by the ultrasonic (harmonic) scalpel, at 0.35-6.5 m 29 . The smaller the particles, the further they travel. Smaller particles are more chemically based, but as the particulate This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Accepted Article matter increases in size, it poses more of a biological hazard, acting as a vector for pathogen transmission, with larger particles traveling up to 1 meter from the operative field 30 . The majority of smoke evacuation and filtration modes facilitate capture of particles above 0.01 m. As the SARS-CoV-2 aerodynamic size is described in the range of 0.06-0.15 m 29,31 , the use of devices with smoke evacuation filters theoretically reduce local inoculation. Previous work has confirmed viral content (papillomavirus & HIV) within surgical smoke 32,33 and documented operator contraction of a papilloma virus using carbon dioxide laser 34 . There are also risks of transmission due to urine spillage and aerosolisation in open and minimally invasive urological interventions, with Ling et al. reporting persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in urine 35 . Although disease transmission of COVID-19 through urine has not yet been demonstrated, The European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section (ERUS) stated urethral or ureteral catheterisation during laparoscopic and robotic procedures should be treated with caution 36 . The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) describe the risk of operator contamination from urine splash as minimal and state aerosol risks are more significant from patients coughing during intimate procedures e.g. catheterisation, or following intubation/extubation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been identified in faeces 37 . Many studies have found that SARS-CoV-1 RNA could be detected in plasma, since the first report on April 10, 2003 38-40 . Overall, 78% of patients had detectable viral RNA in the first week of their illness 41 in line with MERS-CoV 42 and SARS-CoV-2 43 . Due to the risk of asymptomatic carriage and the presence of virus in the blood the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) have published rapid risk assessments regarding blood safety during the pandemic. The ECDC implied a precautionary deferral of donation of blood and cells for 21 days after possible exposure to a confirmed patient or anyone who returned from Wuhan, Chinaapplying the approach used for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV 44 .

All rights reserved. Accepted Article have evolved alongside developing evidence regarding transmission 13 . The standard PPE guidance by Public Health England (PHE) for healthcare workers involved in the direct care of patients within one meter with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 include; disposable apron, gloves, a fluid repellent surgical mask and eye protection comprising either goggles or a face shield 45 . When working in high risk units (e.g. ITU/HDU/A&E Resus/Wards with Non Invasive Ventilation or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ventilation/Operating theatres/Endoscopy units) or in theatre where AGPs are being undertaken, then a respirator (N99 or FFP3 equivalent, which can be either valved or unvalved) is recommended instead of a surgical mask along with a fluid repellent long gown 46 and full-face shield or visor 13,45,46 (Figure 2). PHE are in support of full PPE in relation to AGP's conducted in ANY patient i.e. given the high asymptomatic carrier rate reported in some populations of 16-50% 47 the assumption should be made that all patients, regardless of symptoms, are COVID-19 positive. Respirator masks are categorised according to their ability to filter fine particles in the scale of 0.01-1 m in size according to the EU defined Filtering Face Piece (FFP) Scale, whereas SARS-CoV-2 measures 0.07-0.09 m in diameter on electron microscopy studies 48 .

The documents highlight the need to balance the need for a tracheostomy versus the potential risks to both the patient and staff 54 . Many further publications relating to changes in ENT practice have been published 55-60 .

Lessons from China showed that high healthcare worker infection rates were only improved once PPE was adequate. As a nation, we have had time to plan for this pandemic compared to others less fortunate countries such as Italy and China, where relatively large numbers of healthcare workers succumbed to COVID-19. Such planning has been widely criticised in the scientific press 116 and in recent days there have been wellreported critical shortages of PPE in the UK including gowns and masks. After missing out on an opportunity to join the European Union (EU) joint procurement scheme to bulkpurchase PPE, there is an ever more urgent need to secure and coordinate supply chains 117 . Boris Johnson has recently appointed a PPE 'Tsar', former London Olympics chief executive Paul Deigthon, to coordinate, source and boost manufacturing of protective equipment needed to protect NHS staff. The medical work force is at high risk of exposure as well as increased viral load and although there is a need to balance limited supplies with staff and patient safety, this should not leave the healthcare professionals treating patients with inadequate PPE.
