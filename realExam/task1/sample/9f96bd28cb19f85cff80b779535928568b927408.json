In the United States alone, at least 554,849 cases and 21,942 total deaths have been reported as of April 13, 2020 [1] . The common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being the most prominent complication. Here, we report a case of bradycardia, renal failure, AV nodal blockade, shock, and hyperkalemia (BRASH) syndrome as the initial presentation of COVID-19. This case report highlights the importance of recognizing and appropriately managing the uncommon clinical presentations of COVID-19.",

Triggers include hypovolemia, up-titration of home medications such as potassium-sparing diuretics or antihypertensives, sepsis, and other causes of acute kidney injury [2] . Patients with BRASH syndrome develop renal failure that leads to hyperkalemia. This has a synergistic effect with AV node blockers, i.e., BB and CCB, with the subsequent development of profound hypotension and bradycardia [3] [4] . A key characteristic of BRASH syndrome is mild hyperkalemia causing significant bradycardia without other, typical electrocardiogram (EKG) changes (i.e., widening QRS, peaked T-waves). Bradycardia leads to hypotension, poor renal perfusion, and worsening of renal failure, resulting in a vicious cycle. Standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithms may fail in reversing the bradycardia seen in these patients so it is important to recognize this syndrome and address the underlying etiology in addition to the synergistic effects of AV nodal blockade and hyperkalemia.

Instead, treatment centers around therapy for hyperkalemia, addressing the underlying cause of renal injury (i.e., fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia) and sometimes treating BB or CCB toxicity. In managing hyperkalemia, IV calcium is utilized to stabilize the cardiac membrane while IV insulin and dextrose along with albuterol are used to shift potassium intracellularly. Albuterol may also assist in improving bradycardia. Bicarbonate can be considered in patients with acidosis. Ultimately, potassium must be excreted for definitive management. If patients are euvolemic and able to produce urine, potassium-wasting diuretics can be utilized with emergent dialysis considered in those refractory to treatment. Fluid resuscitation will be required in patients who are hypovolemic. For patients who remain hemodynamically unstable, the use of catecholamines such as dopamine or epinephrine may increase renal perfusion and help resolve the renal failure.
