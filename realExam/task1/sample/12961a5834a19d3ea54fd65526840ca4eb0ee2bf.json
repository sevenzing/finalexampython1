Analysing viral proteins is not only important to characterise the cellular pathogens but also instrumental to decipher the palmitoylation machinery of cells. This comprehensive review describes methods to identify S-acylated proteins and covers the fundamental biochemistry of palmitoylation: the location of palmitoylation sites in viral proteins, the fatty acid species found in S-acylated proteins, the intracellular site of palmitoylation and the enzymology of the reaction. Finally, the functional consequences of palmitoylation are discussed regarding binding of proteins to membranes or membrane rafts, entry of enveloped viruses into target cells by spike-mediated membrane fusion as well as assembly and release of virus particles from infected cells. The topics are described mainly for palmitoylated proteins of influenza virus, but proteins of other important pathogens, such as the causative agents of AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, and of model viruses are discussed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "1 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email mveit@zedat.fu-berlin.de).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Palmitoylation or S-acylation is the post-translational attachment of fatty acids (usually palmitic acid) to cysteine residues by thioester linkage.

Protein-bound fatty acids are then removed with hydroxylamine, an agent that selectively cleaves thioester-linked compounds (thus, fatty acids from S-acylated proteins). The newly exposed free -SH groups can then react with the biotin derivative, which can then be used to precipitate the acylated proteins using streptavidin beads.

In the case of viral spike proteins, only the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are subjected to the analysis. Purified virus particles are digested with specific proteases, which remove the ectodomain from the spike proteins, and the hydrophobic membrane-anchoring fragments are then extracted from 'shaved' virus particles with chloroform/methanol and directly analysed by MS.

In the neighbourhood of acylated cysteines, there are often hydrophobic and basic amino acids, but such residues are typical components of this region of membrane proteins.

Post-translationally but still in the ER, three HA molecules assemble to a trimer, which is the ratelimiting step for transport out of the ER. Trimming of HA-linked carbohydrates occurs in medial Golgi cisternae, and terminal glycosylation in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Also in the TGN, HA proteins with polybasic cleavage sites are split into the membranespanning HA 2 and the large N-terminal HA 1 subunits by the cellular endoprotease furin.

The virus particle travels through the exocytic pathway in order to be secreted by the cell, and the glycoproteins are subject to post-translational modification of their ectodomains, but palmitoylation of the endodomain is unlikely to occur at this stage, since it is shielded inside the virus particle.

The subsequent budding process needs at least one protein which physically drives the curvature of membranes to generate a bud and another (or the same) protein that mediates the scission of the enveloped virus particle from the membrane. Membrane bending and scission are often achieved by cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins, which are recruited by a viral protein to the budding site. The contribution of ESCRT is however limited to some virus families, most prominently retroviruses (such as HIV). Conversely, influenza virus buds independently of ESCRT proteins, and no involvement of ESCRT proteins has been reported for CoVs and togaviruses, the two other virus families where protein palmitoylation is known to affect virus budding (Chen and Lamb, 2008) .

Additionally, M2 has also been implicated in the ultimate step in virus budding, the scission of the virus particle from the plasma membrane. Since peptides representing the amphiphilic helix of M2 induced the budding of vesicles from giant unilamellar vesicles, it was concluded that this amphiphilic helix, situated in the cytoplasmic tail of M2, inserts into the membrane in a wedge-like manner to induce curvature (Rossman et al., 2010a (Rossman et al., , 2010b .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 410, "end": 432, "text": "(Pinto and Lamb, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 853, "end": 875, "text": "(Rossman et al., 2010a", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 876, "end": 900, "text": "(Rossman et al., , 2010b", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Small and hydrophobic proteins with ion channel activity"}, {"text": "Does palmitoylation of the amphiphilic helix affect the various activities of M2?

In cell culture, recombinant viruses where the acylated cysteine in M2 (or in CM2 of influenza C virus) has been replaced grow similarly well as the corresponding wild-type virus (Castrucci et al., 1997; Muraki et al., 2011) , even if acylation is deleted simultaneously with the second raft-targeting signal, the cholesterol-binding CRAC motif (Thaa et al., 2012) .

The position of the most C-terminal cysteine is strictly conserved; the positions of the other two or three cysteines are sometimes shifted by one or more amino acids, but are strictly conserved within an HA subtype ( [Veit and Schmidt, 2006 ] and Andrei Alexeevski, Lomonosov Moscow State University, personal communication). Thus, assuming these cysteine residues (and the attached fatty acids) would not play an essential role for the life cycle of influenza viruses, it is hard to conceive why they have not been exchanged by similar amino acids during evolution of influenza viruses.

Many studies on palmitoylated spike proteins from different virus families conclude that the fatty acids play a role during virus entry by membrane fusion and/or during assembly and budding of new virus particles. During membrane fusion, the fatty acids might perturb the organisation of the lipid layers during the late stage of the fusion process, as exemplarily shown for HA of influenza virus in Figure 3 . Acylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the spike might be required for interactions with internal components of virus particles and/or the incorporation of the spike into membrane rafts, the budding sites of many enveloped viruses. The fatty acid attached to M2 (in concert with a cholesterol-binding site) is believed to target the protein to the edge of rafts, where the protein causes scission of newly assembled virus particles.

Most studies concluded that palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins (spike proteins and viroporins) affects budding of virus particles and/or their subsequent cell entry by membrane fusion.

However, for most palmitoylated proteins, similarly detailed information is not available, mainly because the various crystal structures of viral spike proteins were gathered from their ectodomains only. The lack of structural information of the acylation site's vicinity also hinders the identification of signals that might direct S-acylation in general or the preferential attachment of palmitate versus stearate. If such conformational signals exist, they are not obvious from the primary structure of the protein. For most spike proteins, it is even uncertain at which amino acid exactly a TMR ends and the cytoplasmic domain starts. Hence, it is not known whether a cysteine destined to become acylated is exposed to the hydrophobic lipid environment of the bilayer, the transition region containing the head groups of the lipids or to the hydrophilic milieu of the cytosol.

A projection of HA's transmembrane \u03b1-helix surface with mapped polar and surface properties onto a cylinder shows that there are small and slightly hydrophilic residues (glycine, alanine and serine) above the acylated cysteine, which are surrounded by large and hydrophobic amino acids. This surface morphology of the TMR forms a groove into which a saturated (therefore flexible) acyl chain might fit into (see Figure 2 ). The larger acyl chain of stearate would fill the groove more completly compared with the shorter chain of palmitate. The accommodation of the acyl chain into this cavity converts an irregular and rough TMR surface into a smooth one which is more compatible with raft association of HA. Most (non-acylated) transmembrane proteins are not associated with rafts since their rough TMR surface would disrupt the tight packing of lipids characteristic of raft domains (Kusumi et al., 2011) . The accommodation of the acyl chain is also assumed to 'lubricate' the TMR of HA for subsequent interaction with the planar sterol ring of cholesterol to allow for raft association. In addition, the fatty acids might attract specific lipids, such as cholesterol.
