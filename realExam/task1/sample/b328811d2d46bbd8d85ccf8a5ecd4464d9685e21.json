            "text": "The fi eld of intestinal transplantation has developed significantly since the fi rst reports involving dogs in the late 1950s [ 1 ] . Although small series demonstrated some short-term success of intestinal transplantation in the 1960s [ 1 , 2 ] , longterm success was not reported until tacrolimus was introduced into clinical transplantation in 1990. Subsequently, dramatic and rapid progress in donor and recipient selection processes, evolution of surgical techniques, and enhancements in early perioperative care led to a signifi cant improvement in early postoperative patient and graft survival in this challenging population. Key lessons were learned from the early failures in intestinal transplantation, as most graft loss was attributable to overwhelming rejection due to the inability to provide effective immunosuppression to this complex population in the face of such a lymphoid-rich, bacteriacontaining graft [ 1 ] . Additional causes of early graft loss included ischemic injury of the allograft resulting in poor reperfusion and technical complications. Each of these early factors can be associated with infections occurring after transplant in association with severely damaged allografts rich in pathogens within the intestinal lumen [ 2 ] . Finally, morbidity and mortality were also encountered as a result of the mobilization and engraftment of donor-derived lymphocytes leading to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [ 3 ] .",

As a consequence, intestinal transplants are now performed worldwide with good overall results and long-term survival. Unfortunately, the high levels of longterm immunosuppression necessary to prevent and treat cellular and humoral rejection in ITx recipients have been an important contributor in the majority of deaths following intestinal transplant which have been directly related to infection and malignancy. Indeed, the future success of intestinal transplant relies on balancing the risks of immunologic complications associated with under-immunosuppression and the often fatal consequences of over-immunosuppression.",

IF is a result of either an anatomic loss of their intestine (e.g., congenital intestinal atresias or acquired disorders, such as volvulus, necrotizing enterocolitis, trauma, or vascular thrombosis) or poor function involving motility (e.g., intestinal pseudoobstruction, Hirschsprung disease), absorption (e.g., microvillus inclusion disease), encasing tumors (e.g., desmoids), or Crohn's disease. PN has changed the outcome for patients who have intestinal failure by effectively providing temporizing benefi ts parallel to those seen with hemodialysis in patients with kidney failure. However, long-term survivors of PN can experience morbidity associated with development of catheter sepsis, venous thrombosis-induced loss of vascular access, and PN-induced cholestatic liver disease. Liver disease and the secondarily dilated short gut seen with intestinal adaptation facilitate intestinal bacterial overgrowth, enteritis, bacterial translocation, the seeding of venous catheters, and line sepsis. Severe bloodstream infections can result in metastatic infectious foci, endocarditis, multisystem organ failure, and death. In addition, the infectious complications of IF may contribute to the development and progression of parenteral nutrition-dependent liver injury [ 4 ] . Life-threatening complications occur in as many as 20 % of patients on long-term PN. Without intestinal transplantation, patients with IF who develop complications of PN will die at a signifi cant rate, with 1-year and 3-year survival rates of 84 % and 74 %, respectively [ 5 , 6 ] .",

            "text": "A number of different variations of intestinal transplantation can be carried out to ideally suit the anatomic and functional needs of the recipient; the etiology for intestinal failure dictates the type of intestinal allograft used. The need for associated stomach, pancreas, or colon in addition to the small bowel allograft is determined on the basis of the functional or vascular disease of those organs in the recipient. The diagnosis of end-stage liver disease as a consequence of TPN will determine the need for liver replacement. Consequently, intestinal transplantation procedures may provide the isolated intestine, the combined liver and intestine (with or without the pancreas), complete multivisceral intestinal allografts which include the entire gastrointestinal tract (i.e., stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and small bowel) along with the liver, and modifi ed multivisceral grafts, which include the entire gastrointestinal tract (i.e., stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and small bowel) and exclude the liver [ 4 ] . Patient and graft survivals during the early posttransplant period vary according to the transplantation procedure. The best early survivals are associated with the isolated intestinal transplant, and the worst outcomes are observed in recipients of multivisceral allografts. The reason for this stems from the fact that recipients of isolated intestine allografts are relatively stable, when compared to patients with TPN-induced liver failure (portal hypertension, pancytopenia, coagulopathy) who will also require the larger composite grafts (liver/ intestine or multivisceral grafts). The morbidity and mortality associated with outcomes after multivisceral transplantation stem from the diffi culty of the resection portion of the operation and of the immediate posttransplant management. The risk of infection inherently determines short-term and long-term survivability. Damage to the protective barrier of the intestinal mucosa can occur early from ischemia and reperfusion damage and later from rejection or GVHD of the intestinal allograft. Factors that determine risk for ischemia and reperfusion of the intestinal allograft are similar to those seen with other solid organs; they focus on a history of cardiac arrest and on the subsequent hemodynamic instability of the cadaveric brain-dead donor.",

With isolated intestinal transplantation, the consequences of such an effl ux of bacteria and endotoxin will depend on how the graft is drained. If drained into the recipient's portal or superior mesenteric vein, transient elevations in liver function tests may occur. If it is drained into the systemic circulation via the recipient's inferior vena cava, more signifi cant manifestations of bacteremia may be seen, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

More commonly, rejection episodes tend to be mild to moderate, without such infectious consequences; however, acute rejection should be considered as a potential etiology of any bacteremia with enteric organisms. The overall incidence of rejection of the intestinal allograft has been high (greater than 85 %), with the average patient experiencing between one and fi ve episodes of rejection per graft [ 6 , 12 , 15 ] ; more recent progress in immunosuppression management has introduced the ability to minimize immunosuppressive load, thereby resulting in less rejection and consequently less infection. This high frequency of rejection of varying severities likely accounts for the high frequency of bloodstream infections seen in intestinal transplant recipients. The clinical signs of rejection include abdominal pain, distention, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever; however, these can also suggest the presence of a concomitant bacterial or fungal infection. The diagnosis of rejection is based on the fi ndings from endoscopic biopsies of the intestinal allograft mucosa. Such confi rmation is critical, particularly in longterm patients who present with minimal symptoms, and fever as opportunistic infections, such as CMV and EBV, can produce similar symptoms. In addition, episodes of enteritis secondary to infections with EBV and CMV may also be accompanied by damage to the mucosal barrier and associated bloodstream infections with bacteria and fungi.",

The high risk of CMV and EBV diseases carries a proportionately higher morbidity and mortality as well. The baseline immunosuppression levels-higher than those for other solid organs-that are required for a long term to maintain the intestinal allograft place these patients at a higher risk for symptomatic disease from these pathogens. Children may also be serologically naive for CMV and EBV, thus increasing the already high risk for disease. The chronic, higher level of immunosuppression required by these patients also raises the risk for severe infections from community-acquired pathogens (e.g., infl uenza, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], adenovirus, streptococcal pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia). However, despite high baseline immunosuppression, most intestinal transplant recipients who develop these infections tolerate them quite well because of their improved overall health status. Patient and graft survival after intestinal transplantation is inherently related to the risk of rejection, the need for antirejection therapy, the high levels of baseline immunosuppression, and the risk of posttransplantation infections. In addition, the relationship between patient and graft survival is inherently dependent on the reversibility of the type of transplant performed. For example, if a patient who has undergone an isolated intestinal transplant develops a life-threatening complication of the intestine or immunosuppression (e.g., uncontrollable rejection or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder [PTLD]), the intestinal allograft can be safely removed and the immunosuppression discontinued. Unfortunately, patients who have undergone combined liver and intestinal transplants have a much poorer outcome after the removal of the intestine and discontinuation of immunosuppression with the rapid development of allograft liver disease and death. Until recently, this was responsible for a progressively declining survival curve up until 3-4 years, at which time it plateaus ( Figure 15 -1 ). This curve contrasts with that of recipients of liver or kidney allografts in whom, after the fi rst posttransplantation year, the baseline levels of immunosuppression are lowered, with a declining risk of rejection or infectious complications in the later posttransplant years. This resulted in a higher rate of survival at all posttransplant times. Furthermore, the intestine is a large lymphoid-rich organ, the immunologic role of which cannot be underestimated.",

Even minor and common viral infections in the pre-transplant immunocompetent host can blossom into severe and lifethreatening infections after preconditioning of the recipient.

Foscarnet provided eventual resolution in these cases [ 35 ] . Ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection occurs in up to 15 % of patients after lung transplant and has been found to be due to mutations in the CMV UL 97 or UL54 genes, which respectively encode the viral DNA phosphotransferase and the CMV DNA polymerase. Invasive infections with ganciclovir-resistant CMV are associated with 25 % mortality despite treatment with IVIG and foscarnet and a 78 % rate of foscarnet-induced toxicity [ 40 ] . Case reports using the prodrug lefl unomide suggest its inclusion as a potential tertiary agent for treatment of resistant CMV infection [ 41 ] . In addition to drug therapy, studies in the HSCT literature are emerging that successfully utilize adaptive immunotherapy to treat CMV disease resistant to multidrug therapy [ 41 ] In summary, CMV has been a frequent and important cause of morbidity after intestinal transplantation. CMV has a unique propensity to involve the intestinal allograft and the native gastrointestinal tract, which makes surveillance practical. At present, the use of long-term prophylactic therapy (3-month to 6-month courses) with ganciclovir (either IV or oral valganciclovir) in combination with CMV-specifi c hyperimmune globulin should be considered for CMV +/\u2212 patients [ 42 ] . The use of \"hybrid\" strategies using shorter courses of chemoprophylaxis followed by serial measurements of the CMV viral load in CMV-seropositive recipients may be effective but data are needed before this strategy can be widely recommended [ 42 ] . Prompt diagnosis and treatment of CMV viremia decreases the rate of invasive disease, though little data exists to determine the proper duration of treatment to avoid recurrent disease. Ganciclovir-resistant CMV disease exists and can be associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality in the lung transplant population. The emergence of immunotherapy as a potential modality for treatment of resistant disease may improve the results in these patients.",

Although the intestinal allograft is the most common site of infection, adenovirus can disseminate and can also infect a large variety of organs, including the brain, liver, lungs, and pancreas. The intestine was infected in 83 % of cases in a recent study [ 43 ] . Adenoviral infection is most common in younger recipients and is generally thought of as an \"early\" pathogen, with almost 70 % of cases occurring in the fi rst 6 months after transplant. Overall, adenovirus infection has been observed frequently in pediatric recipients of intestinal transplantation with rates of adenovirus infection in this population ranging from 20.8 to 100 % [ 17 , 21 ] . Adenoviral enteritis generally presents as an osmotic diarrhea, often without associated fever or systemic illness. The gross morphology of infection is one of hyperemic mucosa and ulceration, often diffi cult to distinguish from cellular rejection [ 44 ] . Histologically, there is severe villous injury and characteristic cytopathic adenoviral inclusions in the villi. Crypt apoptosis can also be seen in cases of severe adenoviral enteritis, potentially confusing the underlying diagnosis diffi cult [ 45 ] . Immunohistochemistry allows for better delineation of the inclusions in these cases and serum and tissue DNA polymerase chain reaction can also be used, if needed to confi rm the diagnosis [ 44 ] .

In 1994, the authors began monitoring the EBV viral load in the peripheral blood using a quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (QC/PCR) assay. This monitoring was coupled with a preemptive therapy (PT) strategy in an effort to diagnose early EBV infection rather than after established disease or PTLD is present. This strategy included the use of ganciclovir and intravenous immune globulin and the judicious weaning of immunosuppression. The management of EBV disease and PTLD in intestinal transplant recipients is more complex than that with liver transplant recipients, because signifi cant decreases or withdrawal of immunosuppression, which are the mainstay for management in other solid organ recipients, can result in severe breakthrough intestinal allograft rejection. This strategy is even more challenging as ITx recipients can present with evidence of concomitant EBV disease and rejection. Thus, the morbidity and mortality in the setting of PTLD can stem from the lymphoproliferative process, concomitant infections with CMV and bacterial pathogens, and/or severe intestinal allograft rejection [ 52 , 53 ] .",

At our institution, this therapy is instituted for elevated and/or rapidly rising viral loads. The exact level of EBV load to initiate PT will vary according to which assay is used to measure the load. In addition, we have typically initiated PT at very low loads for EBV-seronegative recipients experiencing primary infection while we have used cutoffs close to levels where EBV disease and PTLD are observed for those who are EBV seropositive prior to transplant. Although the effectiveness of each of the individual components of this strategy remain unproven, the combined use of this approach along with evolutions in immunosuppression algorithms for these patients has resulted in decreases in the incidence, morbidity, and mortality attributable to EBV disease and PTLD in this population [ 53 ] .",

With intestinal transplant recipients, such manipulations of immunosuppressive drugs have resulted in high rejection rates, complicating the management of EBV disease and PTLD. More recent immunosuppressive management strategies using antilymphocyte globulin induction and tacrolimus at low levels (10 ng/mL) and no steroids have allowed for signifi cant improvement in the incidence and severity of rejection and also the ability to minimize immunosuppression in a similar fashion as with other organs. This has resulted in improved survival and also in a signifi cantly lower rate of CMV and EBV/PTLD [ 12 ] (Figure 15-4 ) . The majority of patients will demonstrate some evidence of a clinical response within 2-4 weeks after modulation of medications. The impact of EBV viral load monitoring on the incidence and outcome of EBV disease and PTLD cannot be overemphasized. Rates of EBV disease and PTLD using this approach have dropped dramatically when compared to a cohort of children undergoing intestinal transplantation at the authors' institution prior to the availability of this approach [ 54 ] . Therefore, early diagnosis does affect the outcome of EBV disease, and judicious reductions of immunosuppression in this setting allow resolution with a lower incidence or absence of rejection of the intestinal allograft.",

This contrasts sharply to the recurrence rate of 5-10 % seen with other solid organ transplants. This likely results from the ongoing need of the intestinal transplant recipient to continue with high baseline levels of immunosuppressive therapy, which limits the body's ability to generate a cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte response against EBV. Of note, evolutions in the management of ITx recipients, including evolving immunosuppression strategies and the use of EBV load monitoring, have resulted in a marked improvement in the outcome of PTLD [ 51 ] . Unfortunately, this will not be adequate treatment in some PTLD lesions that are no longer under control of EBV and behave more like true malignancies [ 50 ] . The authors recommend a trial of immunosuppression reduction unless there is concurrent rejection or histologic evidence of true malignancy.

Studies have demonstrated variable success in using rituximab in treatment of PTLD that has not responded to IS reduction. Studies in children have shown good short-term response rates of 80 %, though there is a signifi cant recurrence rate of 25 % [ 58 ] . Rituximab has become a key com-ponent of treatment of CD20-positive PTLD in some intestinal recipients, especially those with concurrent rejection or those not responding to the combination of immunosuppression reduction and antiviral/immunoglobulin therapy. Vigilant posttreatment follow-up is required as recurrence is possible and occurred in roughly 20 % of responders in one large French study, at a median of 7 months after treatment. In addition, a signifi cant percentage of patients will develop hypogammaglobulinemia and should be appropriately treated [ 58 ] . Additionally, encouraging results have been obtained using a combination of low-dose chemotherapy and rituximab in the treatment of PTLD in setting of solid organ transplant. Studies have shown 2-year relapse-free survival rates of 70 % [ 59 ] . While the use of EBV-specifi c cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) to treat EBV-related PTLD (which has shown to be effective in bone marrow recipients) is of interest, experience to date has not been able to demonstrate defi nitive success in SOT recipients. As an alternative approach, Haque and colleagues have developed a bank of 100 EBV-specifi c CTLs, using healthy blood donors in the UK. Using this bank, the authors used HLA \"best fi t\" CTLs in a phase II multicenter trial to treat PTLD that was refractory to other methods with 52 % overall response rate. Of those patients that had a response, an impressive 82 % were complete [ 60 ] with documented long-term survival in responders [ 61 ] . Finally, transplant physicians should also recognize the importance of allograft enterectomy to allow for complete withdrawal of immunosuppression in cases where such an approach can be taken (isolated intestinal transplant), especially for those not responding to fi rst-or second-line therapies.

Interestingly, RSV infection was associated with a 40 % mortality, and was the direct cause of death, despite reduction in immunosuppression and administration of palivizumab [ 63 ] .

Treatment of RSV is limited, though careful reduction in baseline immunosuppression should be considered if clinically warranted. Aerosolized ribavirin is currently approved for the treatment of severe RSV LRTRVI and is generally used in combination with palivizumab, though data supporting this are limited. Intravenous ribavirin has also been used for treatment; the benefi t of this agent must be weighed against the potential for the development of complication, specifi cally hemolytic anemia [ 65 ] .

Inappropriate use of immunosuppression to empirically treat rejection in a transplant patient can, and has been, a fatal mistake. Conversely, delayed treatment of severe rejection due to a suspected infectious cause can lead to exfoliative rejection and graft loss. Unfortunately, gross inspection of the allograft is nonspecifi c and requires histologic inspection to adequately differentiate between severe allograft enteritis and rejection. In addition, the ability to make the diagnosis is further confounded by the possibility that the two processes can occur simultaneously or that rejection can rapidly follow an episode of infectious enteritis, making serial endoscopic investigations necessary.

Although specifi c reports describing the course of CDI in intestinal transplant recipients are lacking, however it was found to be the etiology of diarrhea in 15 % of these patients and responded to standard antibiotic therapy [ 70 ] . Recurrent CDI has been shown to be associated with risk factors such as increased LOS, prolonged antibiotic courses, high levels of immunosuppression, and other comorbid conditions [ 71 ] . Parasitic enteritis is also seen n ITx recipients. Infection due to Cryptosporidium sp. has been reported in intestinal recipients [ 70 ] as has infection due to Giardia lamblia [ 70 ] . Recent attention has begun to focus on norovirus as a cause of enteritis in SOT recipients. Despite its self-limited course in the general population, norovirus has been demonstrated to be the cause of prolonged diarrhea with severe dehydration in pediatric intestinal transplant recipients and infection is associated with a prolonged viral shedding [ 72 ] . Diagnosis can be diffi cult, as intestinal epithelial apoptosis is a common fi nding in human calicivirus enteritis, making differentiation for rejection diffi cult. If clinically suspected, however the diagnosis can be confi rmed with PCR analysis of biopsy specimens or effl uent [ 73 ] .",
