            "text": "We study the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background induced by the primordial scalar perturbation with the spectrum having a lognormal peak of width \u2206 at k = k * . We derive an analytical formula for the GW spectrum \u2126GW for both narrow (\u2206 1) and broad (\u2206 1) peaks. In the narrow-peak case, the spectrum has a double peak feature with the sharper peak at k = 2k * / \u221a 3. On the infrared (IR) side of the spectrum, we find power-law behavior with a break at k = k b in the power-law index where it chages from k 3 on the far IR side to k 2 on the near IR side. We find the ratio of the break frequency to the peak frequency is determined by \u2206 as f b /fp \u2248 \u221a 3\u2206, where f b and fp are the break and peak frequencies, respectively. In the broad-peak case, we find the GW spectrum also has a lognormal peak at k = k * but with a smaller width of \u2206/ \u221a 2. Using these derived analytic formulae, we also present expressions for the maximum values of \u2126GW for both narrow and broad cases. Our results will provide a useful tool in searching for the induced GW signals in the coming decades.",

Besides GW bursts from mergers, there are also stochastic backgrounds of various origins such as GWs from binary inspirals, GWs from first order phase transitions in the early universe, primordial GWs from inflation, and the induced GWs from the primordial scalar perturbation. In the spatially homogeneous and isotropic background, the tensor and scalar perturbations are decoupled at linear order, but they are coupled to each other at nonlinear order [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , giving rise to the induced GWs or secondary GWs . The primordial scalar perturbation (more precisely scalar-type curature perturbation) produces the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) anisotropy and seeds the large scale structure of the universe, and its properties are tightly constrained observations. Namely, it is Gaussian with a nearly scale-invariant spectrum with the rms amplitude of 10 \u22125 on scales larger than around 1 Mpc [40] . The GWs induced by such primordial scalar perturbation is also nearly scale-invariant at frequencies higher than 10 \u221215 Hz, but the amplitude is negligibly small to be detected [14] , and perhaps smaller than GWs from the primordial tensor perturbation [41, 42] .",

            "text": "However, on scales much smaller than 1 Mpc , the amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbation is ony weakly constrained, and hence it is possible to be large [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . An interesting consequence associated with a large scalar perturbation is the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). If the rms scalar perturbation amplitude is large at some specific wavenumber, PBHs can form from the high \u03c3 peaks when the corresponding wavelengths reenter the Hubble horizon [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The current observational constraints does not exclude the existence of a substantial amount of such PBHs. There are actually several interesting \"mass windows\" [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] , which can lead to fruitful phenomena. For instance, the detection of GWs by LIGO/Virgo has revealed the ubiquitous existence of BHs with 10 \u223c 100M , which revives our interest in the hypothesis that such BH binaries are formed by PBHs [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] . It is also probable that PBHs are the dominant component of the dark matter if they are in the mass range 10 19 \u223c 10 22 g, which avoids recent observational constraints [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . In addition, PBHs may seed the galaxy or structure formation [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] , the planet 9 [92, 93] , or they may provide a mechanism for baryogenesis [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] .

Such a spectrum with a high peak can be realized in various models of inflation, for instance, models with potential having a near-inflection point [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] , modified gravity [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] , multi-field inflation [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] , curvaton scenarios [131] [132] [133] [134] , models with parametric resonance [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] , etc.. The induced GWs from these models may be detected in the near future by the current and future detectors like LIGO/Virgo, KAGRA [147] , LISA [148] [149] [150] [151] , Taiji [152] , Tianqin [153] , ET [154, 155] , DECIGO [156] , BBO [157] [158] [159] , FAST [160] , and SKA [161, 162] . The peak frequency of the induced GWs is related to the associated PBH mass as f peak = 6.7 \u00d7 10 \u22129 (M PBH /M ) \u22121/2 Hz [17] . If LIGO detections are PBHs, the induced GWs peak at nHz, right in the detection range of pulsar timing array (PTA) [140, 141] . The fact that there is no detection at present has already started to constrain the PBHs-as-LIGO-BHs scenario [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] . For asteroid-mass PBHs, the associated induced GWs peak at \u223c 10 \u22123 Hz, which must be detectable by LISA if PBHs are the dark matter [29] .",

[15, 17, 23, 24] , and an analytical expression for the GW spectrum was derived in Ref. [28] . However, it was found that the infrared scaling of the GW spectrum depends sensitively on the width, which is f 2 for a \u03b4-function peak, while f 3 for a finite width, and a transition from f 3 to f 2 was observed for a finite but small width [164, 165] . In the case of a broad peak, the induced GW spectrum was numerically studied and found to have a broad-peak-like feature near its maximum [22, 43, 44] . The goal of this paper is to derive an analytic formula for the induced GW spectrum due to the scalar perturbation with the spectrum having a lognormal peak, for both narrow and broad widths. The result will provide a very useful tool for studying various phenomena associated with the original curvature perturbation.",

Among possible sources of stochastic backgrounds, the secondary GWs induced by the primordial curvature perturbation is a very important target. As both the generation of GWs and the formation of PBHs occur essentially at the horizon reentry of the relevant scale in the early universe, the fruitful PBH physics motivated us to study the associated induced GWs. Observations on both sides can be used to probe the primordial curvature perturbation on small scales, where there is no stringent constraints.",

Such a spectrum is frequently discussed in the literature from the viewpoints of both inflationary phenomenology and PBH formation mechanism. We have found that the resulting spectrum of the induced GWs has distinct features depending on the width of the longnormal spectrum, \u2206. For both narrow-peak (\u2206 1) and broad-peak (\u2206 1) cases, we have successfuly obtained an analytical formula with amazingly good accuracy, as presented in (19) for \u2206 1 and (40) for \u2206 1, respectively. For the narrow-peak case, the GW spectrum (19) can be further simplified by using the GW spectrum for a \u03b4-function peak. Namely, it may be factorized into two components,",

In addition, there appears a logarithmically diverging peak at k p \u2248 2k * / \u221a 3.
