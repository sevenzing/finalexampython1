Viral bronchiolitis and bacterial pneumonia account for the majority of lower respiratory tract infections that lead to respiratory insuffi ciency and pediatric intensive care admission. Twenty-seven percent of children who require mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h in pediatric intensive care units are diagnosed with bronchiolitis and 16% have the diagnosis of pneumonia. The median length of time intubated for an acute pulmonary infection leading to respiratory failure is approximately 7 days. Viral bronchiolitis remains the leading cause for hospital admission in infancy and the most frequent cause of acute respiratory failure in children admitted to pediatric intensive care units in North America.

Hemagglutinin 1, 2, and 3 and neuraminidase 1 and 2 typically infect humans. The gene segments for the surface glycoproteins are unstable, so mutations, called antigenic shift, occur regularly. Epidemics occur annually during the winter months with a short, 1-3 day incubation period. The virus causes destruction of the ciliated respiratory epithelium within 1 day of symptoms. Airway edema and infi ltration with infl ammatory cells into the airway mucosa and epithelium follows. Slow repair occurs over 2-4 weeks. A severe fulminating pneumonia may result in hemorrhagic exudates that contain many polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells. Destruction of the respiratory epithelium often leads to secondary bacterial infections.",

Early diagnosis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be made with 80% sensitivity on nasopharyngeal aspirates within the fi rst 3 days of the illness.

Young children run a milder and shorter biphasic clinical course. Cough is found in approximately half the children, and crackles are rarely heard despite radiographic evidence of infi ltrates.

Children with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia often require increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), increased inspiratory time, and aggressive pulmonary toilet to recruit alveoli. For patients requiring high levels of PEEP, adequate sedation is often required to prevent patient/ventilator asynchrony and barotrauma. Spontaneous respirations should be encouraged while on mechanical ventilation. Rarely, the use of neuromuscular blockade is required to allow mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning may improve ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching in dependent lung regions. Lung protective strategies allowing permissive hypercapnea with small lung volumes to ventilate and appropriate PEEP to maintain alveolar recruitment is recommended for children with pneumonia. High frequency oscillatory ventilation can also be utilized to maintain mean airway pressure and alveolar recruitment. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) provides recruitment of alveoli while allowing spontaneous respirations. In children with severe respiratory distress syndrome, treatment with bovine surfactant may improve oxygenation. Extracorporeal life support continues to have a role in children with reversible severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure refractory to mechanical ventilation.",

These occur when the fl uid production by the interstitial lung tissue exceeds the maximum pleural lymphatic fl ow. Parapneumonic effusions often occur from pneumonia as white blood cells and other debris of infection block the lymphatics resulting in elevation of protein in the pleural space, increase in colloid osmotic pressure, and consequent failure of fl uid reabsorption. On physical exam, the child will have decreased breath sounds over the effusion. In older children, auscultatory percussion changes might be appreciated. Plain chest radiographs can reveal most clinically signifi cant effusions. Ultrasound and chest computed tomograms are useful in determining the volume and quality of the fl uid and the presence of loculations. Simple parapneumonic effusions or transudates can also be differentiated from exudates by using the criteria of Light et al. (Table 25 -2 ). A pleural fl uid pH less than 7.2 indicates a complicated effusion that is likely exudative and requires drainage whereas a pleural fl uid pH more than 7.3 suggests that the effusion may be managed with systemic antibiotics alone.",

Simple parapneumonic effusions usually resolve with thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy and antibiotic treatment of the pneumonia. More complicated parapneumonic effusions have been successfully treated with thoracotomy tubes and fi brinolytics. However, although risks for bleeding are reportedly low, this therapy requires close monitoring of chest tube drainage and instillation of expensive medications with intermittent clamping of the chest tube. No single recommendation for the choice of fi brinolytic agent or dosage has been established. Also, if tried late in the organizing phase, this is often unsuccessful due to loculations and the high viscosity of the purulent fl uid. Surgical debridement either by open procedure or by video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) is often needed for organizing, complicated parapneumonic effusions. Multiple studies have reported that early VATS or thoracotomy for empyema leads to a shorter hospital stay.
