Information systems research on digital platforms for the health sector has focused more on healthcare. Less research exists on health insurance. This study, therefore, addresses the research gap by focusing on digital platform for national health insurance service in a developing country. The study employs qualitative, interpretive case study as methodology and institutional theory as analytical lens to investigate regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional effects on digital platform development and use for national health insurance in Ghana. The findings show the institutional enablers as: (1) healthseeking culture; (2) mobile network penetration and use; and (3) appropriate laws and regulations. Conversely, the constraints are (1) Unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) functionality; and (2) extended family system.",

Digital platforms are characterised as having layered modular architecture with a core module and loosely-coupled components [1] . By their nature, digital platforms facilitate change and evolution of their use through re-configuration of their architecture and components. There is widespread use of digital platforms in various organisations and sectors [2, 3] . Within the developing country health sector, some health insurance organisations have implemented digital platforms while others are in the process of doing so amidst some challenges.",

Furstenau and Auschra [8] also investigate strategies to implement and scale digital platforms in highly-regulated settings such as health care. The authors observed that openness on code and content layers fuel platform growth and contribution. However, financial risks and uncertainties in health care regulations can result in platform failure and avoid opportunities to achieve potential benefits. Implementing and scaling digital platformespecially in health care-based organisationsis a difficult task and requires the resolution of tensions around autonomy-related benefits and control [8, 13] .",

A prototype version of the platform was initially developed from which it was scaled to pilot and production. Modules of the platform include a payment system linked to a mobile service aggregator. The payment module channels payments between NHIS members using the mobile renewal application on their mobile devices and NHIS digital platform over the mobile telecommunications network of the participating telecoms companies Vodafone, MTN and AirtelTigo. It also includes an application programming interface (APIs) to integrate with health provider platforms for authentications. The mobile renewal application was piloted successfully in two districts in Ghana and eventually rolled out nationwide from December 2018. The mobile renewal part of the solution uses unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) to provide messaging service to health insurance members, including the renewal of their membership and payment of premium. The mobile application sends SMS reminder before the expiration of the subscribers' eligibility. The reminder offers the option to complete payment of the insurance premium immediately after the SMS. Insurance subscribers can check when their policy is due to expire. Other features available within the application is the ability to view the benefits packages as well as a comprehensive list of medicines. Service benefits to members expected from the platform include improved member renewal and registration, and reduced waiting times at DMHIS offices. In driving the schemes overall policy goal of attaining universal health coverage, the digital platform is also expected to eliminate process bottlenecks to increase NHIS penetration in Ghana by allowing members to renew their policies at the comfort of their homes without having to queue at district offices.",

Through this process, a comprehensive analysis of membership and claims validity checks can be undertaken from which appropriate punitive measures for invalid claims submission can be taken.

This process involves the health insurance member first generating a code called a voucher number. After the code is received, the health insurance member will have to dial another shortcode to complete the health insurance renewal process, resulting in two separate steps for the subscriber.

This has been attributed to integration challenges between the other platform partners such as the mobile aggregator, the mobile telecommunications provider, including the NHIS where system handshakes are not completed. Lastly, digital illiteracy, the inability to use and access digital information and tools have resulted in the situation where some health insurance members are unable to use the service and rely on third parties, including mobile money vendors with the unintended consequence of giving out their personal information.",

The research findings suggest that the principal regulative institution establishing the NHIS is Act 852 that replaced Act 650 in October 2012 to consolidate the NHIS. The objective of the revised law is to remove operational bottlenecks and drive transparency towards the attainment of universal health insurance coverage. The regulative pillar's legitimising influence supports and authorises individuals within the NHIS to take specific actions, in this case, the development and implementation of a digital platform to boost membership registration in order to meet the united nations universal health coverage goals. The design and construction of digital artefacts and technologies are mandated by regulative authorities often in the interests of the larger society [9] .",

However, normative constraints embedded in USSD interface across mobile telecommunications provider platforms poses challenges to continued adoption and use of the service platform. Health insurance members experiencing challenges will revert to travelling to DMHIS offices to renew their health insurance memberships defeating the goal of improving service experience using the platform. The extended family system, which is deeply embedded in the Ghanaian culture is a group consisting of close kin organised around either patrilineal or matrilineal relatives or lines. The extended family system results from the communal rather than individualistic social network based on a fundamental need to care for other members of the extended family [34] . This system typically includes a man, his wife, children or offspring in addition to other kin. By extension of this system, reverence is accorded family heads and community leaders. In practice, family heads can register for national health insurance membership on behalf of an entire household while community leaders do same for community members. In secondary schools, mass registration of students unto the national health insurance can be linked to a single phone number of a school head. Within the NHIS mobile authentication platform, when a member visits the health provider to access health care, the member after consultation receives a notification on their mobile device asking them to confirm whether they were at the health provider on a given day and time to access health care. This verification system is for purposes of enabling the NHIS to link attendance to claims received from the health provider, many of which are fraudulently sent for payment.",

The findings show that digital platform is a promising means to help health insurance organisations in developing countries to achieve national coverage.
