The idea of flattening the curve has resulted in an unprecedented lock down and deferment of all elective orthopaedic surgery, including Arthroplasty. As the concept of Herd immunity gained traction and the realization that at some stage we will need to return to normalcy, there are several areas of doubt and confusion exist. Earlier, the decision of shutting down was relatively much easier than the much more complicated process of reopening now! With the pandemic around, there also exists an 'infodemic' where several pieces of information were littered, with little or no conclusive evidence to provide satisfactory guidance to the Arthroplasty surgeons.
