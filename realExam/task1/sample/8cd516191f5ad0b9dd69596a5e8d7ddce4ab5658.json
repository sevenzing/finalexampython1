We consider both protection of the wearer and of the community to be important, but we believe that source control is most important. In a systematic review before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, wearing face masks reduced the odds of contracting acute respiratory infections by 6% among casual community contacts and by 19% among household contacts if both the infected and healthy individuals wore masks. 13 Masks have been shown to be effective in reducing respiratory virus shedding from droplets and aerosols of symptomatic individuals infected with coronavirus, influenza virus, and rhinovirus. 14 There is also laboratory evidence that homemade masks effectively stop droplets from infecting the wearer. 15 Surgical masks are disposable and designed to protect healthcare workers, although surgeons used cloth masks to protect wounds from droplets many years ago. The barrier layer in cloth masks is usually two layers of cotton-woven fabric, compared with two to four layers of nonwoven polypropylene fabric with filtration holes in surgical masks. Effectiveness of cloth masks compared with surgical masks needs further evaluation because some clinical studies have raised concerns regarding their effectiveness. 16 However, the wearing of cloth masks by asymptomatic individuals is justified by evidence that droplets and aerosols get trapped when they hit the weave of the fabric, with potentially better trapping than surgical masks. In any case, cloth masks have been adopted as an alternative when surgical masks are limited in supply. 17 Moreover, cloth masks are cheap, washable, easy to make, and can be used by the general population without imposing extra cost to local governments while they are already overwhelmed by lack of resources.",

We call on WHO and country-level public health leaders to urgently consider revising their policies on mass masking to facilitate implementation of appropriate interventions in communities around the world. Considering the close community contact in densely populated areas around the world and documented evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic individuals, it is appropriate to consider masking as a robust tool to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This is highly recommended in public places including public transportation, grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies, hospitals, rehabilitation units, nursing homes, offices, places of religious worship, workplaces, or even crowded streets. In summary, laboratory data support both surgical and cloth masks, but real-world efficacy of cloth masks needs further evaluation. Cloth masks are affordable globally and might be the only option in some areas with limited resources. Based on our current level of evidence, we highly recommend mass masking around the world during the pandemic. Whereas surgical masks are the preferred recommendation for the general public, cloth masks should be considered as a substitute if supplies are limited or surgical masks are not available.",
