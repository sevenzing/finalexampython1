            "text": "Thrombocytopenia was noted in 36% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in one of the early studies, 11 although subsequent researchers have confirmed this is usually mild. The hyper-inflammatory state and cytokine storm induced by the viral infection results in a prothrombotic state, and likely endothelial and platelet activation occurs. 32 Thrombocytopenia is usually multifactorial in critically ill patients. Its pathogenesis is likely to be more complex than the conventional model of platelet consumption associated with thrombin-mediated platelet activation, and the use of antibiotics, antivirals, heparin and other commonly used agents, as well as haemodialysis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), may contribute in some cases. Furthermore, platelet production may be affected by direct viral insult to the bone marrow 17 or reduced effect of thrombopoietin. 3 In end stage COVID-19 infection, multi-organ failure may exacerbate thrombocytopenia, and pooled results of nine studies involving 1779 COVID-19 positive patients revealed that the platelet count was lower in those with very severe disease (P < 0\u00c1001). 20 Indeed, the lower the platelet count, the worse the prognosis. This was supported by a recent, large, singlecentre study from Wuhan involving 1,476 consecutive patients with COVID-19, showing mortality increasing with progressively lower platelet counts. 37 This is perhaps not unexpected, as other studies of critically ill patents show thrombocytopenia to be a marker of poor clinical outcome. 24 Huang et al. found 20% of COVID-19 patients who died had a platelet count <100 9 10 9 /l, compared with 1% of survivors (P < 0\u00c10001). 13 Despite the numerous potential causes of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 positive patients, a count below 100 9 10 9 /l is unusual, only occurring in around 5% of hospitalised patients and 8% of those on ITU. 13 Postulated mechanisms for the relative preservation of platelet count are increased thrombopoietin production from liver stimulation and megakaryocytes in the lung producing large amounts of platelets. 31 Very low platelet counts of <20 9 10 9 /l, or a sudden fall in the platelet count >50% over 24-48 h, is likely to indicate an immune aetiology, although this can also occur in the pre-terminal stages of COVID-19. Immune causes, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura and atypical haemolytic uraemia syndrome, should be considered if there is associated microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) and, in the former, an ADAMTS13 level <10%. Experience of testing COVID-19 patients without TTP has found ADAMTS13 levels of 20-40%, typical of other inflammatory states. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia develops at a median of 14 days after the onset of a new drug, or sooner if there has been previous exposure. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) occurs between 5 and 10 days after the first exposure, or within 24 h of recurrent exposure. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia is a diagnosis of exclusion, there being no confirmative test.",

However, current guidance from the WHO is to avoid steroids if there are alternative treatment options. 35 In patients who are negative for COVID-19 infection, using thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as first-line therapy may be the preferred option. This use is off-label, and local funding may need to be sought through the COVID-19 Interim Measures scheme. One should be mindful that TPO-RAs can take 7-14 days before an effect is seen, and if urgent platelet elevation is needed, intravenous immunoglobulin may be required.",

            "text": "For patients who are COVID-19 positive, the treatment dilemma is even more pronounced. A concern with the use of TPO-RAs for initial treatment is the increased thrombotic potential, which might exacerbate thromboembolic risk in a patient with COVID-19. A recent in vitro study of samples from 26 patients showed that those with ITP (not in the context of COVID-19) had increased microvesicle-associated thrombin generation 2 weeks after initiation of TPO-RA treatment compared with controls and pre-treatment levels. 10 Systematic review of trials examining clinical thromboembolic events has found higher rates in patients on TPO-RAs compared with controls, 5 and a long-term clinical study of eltrombopag showed 6% of patients developed arterial or venous thrombosis. 34 There are similar findings with romiplostim, but direct comparison with placebo showed no increase in thrombotic risk; 6,18 however, as expected, risk of thrombosis increases with age. 18 Additionally, hepatobiliary events have been found to occur in 15% of patients on eltrombopag, 34 and the drug carries a black box warning for risk for hepatotoxicity. Although clinically significant liver injury has reportedly been uncommon in COVID-19, 4 liver enzymes are usually elevated and the required monitoring of liver function tests throughout treatment with eltrombopag 25,27 would be complicated.",

There is concern about potentially higher risks of mortality and secondary infection, which were seen in a systematic review of observational studies of corticosteroids in patients with influenza; however, most of the included studies reported on patients receiving high steroid doses (>40 mg methylprednisolone per day) and the evidence was judged as very low to low quality, owing to confounding by indication. 19 Another study that addressed this limitation by adjusting for time-varying confounders found no effect on mortality. 8 Finally, a recent study of patients receiving corticosteroids for MERS used a similar statistical approach; it found no effect of corticosteroids on mortality but delayed clearance of MERS-CoV from the lower respiratory tract. 2 Thus, whilst further evidence is awaited, steroids may be the better option for COVID-19 positive patients presenting with new or relapsed ITP; however, the dose and duration of treatment should be kept to the minimum necessary. Starting doses of 20mg daily (regardless of patient's weight) may be considered in non-bleeding patients, and increasing after 3-5 days if there is no response. Long courses of steroids should be avoided, and the usual recommendation of tapering after 2 weeks should be adhered to.",

However, administration requires hospital attendance, supply is short and, whilst clinical complications are rare, they can be significant. 29 The role IvIg may play in the management of patients with severe COVID-19 infection is unknown. A small retrospective study from Wuhan suggested that initiation of IvIg as adjuvant treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia within 48 h of admission to intensive care may reduce the use of mechanical ventilation and promote earlier recovery of patients. 36 In the absence of adequate titres of neutralizing antibodies, standard IvIg is unlikely to have a biologic effect on COVID-19.

Rituximab is responsible for long-lasting B cell depletion and potentially severe infectious events, and the impact of the drug on the infection risk of COVID-19 is not clear. Furthermore, it can decrease formation of de novo antibodies. Until further information becomes available, it may be prudent to avoid immunosuppressant agents and rituximab in new or relapsed patients during the COVID-19 pandemic if possible.",
