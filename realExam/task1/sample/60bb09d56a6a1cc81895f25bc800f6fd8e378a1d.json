Previous reports have identified alterations in the renin-angiotensin system activity profile of blacks. 4 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 enters human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and angiotensin II activity potentially contributes to disease severity and organ damage. 5 Owing to the small sample size of this case series, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding COVID-19 susceptibility in black males with OHT.
