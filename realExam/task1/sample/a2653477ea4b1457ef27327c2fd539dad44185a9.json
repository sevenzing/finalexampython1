Extension of the present model for further studies was also suggested. This study opens a new theoretical way for probing into the complex behaviors of SARS coronavirus. Named by the world health organization (WHO), severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS is a newly emerging world-wide infectious disease [1] [2] [3] , which is also commonly called atypical pneumonia in China [1] [2] [3] [4] . Since its outbreak, SARS has brought about serious threatening on the human health. Up to now, investigating the pathogenesis and treatment therapy on SARS keeps receiving great attentions over the world. Some encouraging progresses have been achieved in the SARS research such as identification of cause of disease [5] [6] [7] , gene sequencing [8] [9] [10] , virus detection [11] , epidemiology analysis [12, 13] , drug and bacterin development [14] , pathology [15] , and clinical therapy [16, 17] etc. It now becomes clear that, the pathogeny to induce SARS is a brand new type of coronavirus, whose behavior turns out rather unique and had never been found before in nature. However, since little is known about the properties of SARS and no effective drugs are available, successful treatments on this disease at the present stage are extremely difficult, if not impossible. Clearly, revealing the physical and chemical behaviors of the SARS coronavirus either in or outside the human body will be very beneficial for fighting the SARS. One of the latest advancements made by the WHO multicentre collaborative network (MCN) on SARS is the successful test on the survival time of SARS coronavirus under several different environmental conditions [18] . Owing to this contribution, we now get to know that the survival time for the SARS coronavirus in the air spans from hours to days or even longer time. Such a huge difference in time scale is rather perplexing, whose interpretation is waiting for great efforts. In fact, the survival behavior of SARS coronavirus is a complex issue, which depends both on the surroundings and the virus itself [19] . To reveal the intrinsic mechanisms, a systematic theory concise in concept would be very desirable. In this study, we proposed to quantify the denaturation or replication process of the SARS coronavirus through a rate equation theory and new models capable of comprehensively characterizing the physical and chemical behaviors of SARS coronavirus will be established.",

            "text": "It is well known that, virus is a non-cellular organism, who realizes its surviving by attacking a hosting cell. The virus could not divide itself automatically [20] . As an organism consisted by certain special nucleic acid and protein, the denaturation of SARS coronavirus can be regarded as a temperature dependent rate problem, just as any natural substances do. In fact, it has long been a basic way to address the thermal injury of biological tissues by using the rate equation. Henriques and Moritz [21] were the first to characterize the thermal injury as a first order chemical reaction process. The concise equation given by them late became the start point to analyze the thermal injury problem of biological tissues. Xu and Qian [22] made new progress in better understanding the thermal injury mechanisms by introducing the denaturation of enzyme protein. Recently, Bhowmick and Bischof [23] performed an experimental test on the injury problem of the cell membrane. Typical biophysical and biochemical events occurring in thermal injury at macro or cellular level generally include [24] : thermal denaturation of proteins, alterations in metabolic process, thermally induced alterations in physical or chemical characteristics of cells like hyperpermeability of membrane, intracellular ionic concentration and nuclear degradation, loss of birefringence properties in muscle and collagen, loss of hemoglobin from red blood cells. Similarly, the denaturation process of the SARS coronavirus in the air or its hosting cell should also follow the same mechanism as above, although may vary in the rate coefficients. The rate process model is originally established from the chemical reaction dynamics [25] [26] [27] [28] . Referring to Fig. 1 , one can see that for a typical reaction, the thermally activated reactant should overcome an energy barrier E a in order to generate products. Correspondingly, possibilities for the virus to replicate or die out also depends on the magnitude of its stored energy, and the premise for this to happen is that the stored energy should be higher than that of its critical reaction value, i.e. the activation energy. If treating the denaturation process of the virus as a first order process and defining the injury function as X, one can write its changing rate as,",

Depicted in Fig. 3 are the predicted survival times of the Fig. 3 as Fig. 4 and define the temperature above 20\u00b0C as thermally important temperature. In the following, we will make a few discussions on the survival behaviors of SARS coronavirus at several special temperatures. If the environmental temperature is at 37\u00b0C, Fig. 4 shows that the survival time for the SARS coronavirus is t 0 \u00bc 3:97 h. Therefore, at a hot season such as summer, it is generally not easy for the SARS coronavirus to survive, and possibility for inducing the disease epidemic will be significantly decreased. On the other hand, if intentionally heating the virus by using the tumor hyperthermia temperature 42\u00b0C, which is bearable by human body, the predicted survival time for the SARS coronavirus is t 0 \u00bc 2:24 h (see Fig. 4 ). Consequently, treatment of SARS through high temperature heating is possible, as long as the heating can be kept to a long enough time. Because hyperthermia therapy is a relatively safe and non-noxious way, it is worthy of trying to cure SARS, especially since no miracle drug and definite treatment strategy are available at the present time. Besides, if the temperature was further increased to a higher however still bearable level, the treatment time can be evidently shortened. For example, if choosing heating temperature 56\u00b0C to do calculation, the predicted survival time for the SARS coronavirus is only t 0 \u00bc 0:49 h. In addition, if certain assistant drug was designed to decrease the activation energy or increase the frequency factor of the SARS coronavirus, the virus could possibly be killed by an ordinary heating under a relatively low temperature. In this sense, combining drug delivery and hyperthermia to cure SARS is worth of investigation. We have proposed an engineering approach to restrain the replication of SARS coronavirus through directly ventilating hot oxygen to the human alveolus [30] . Should be pointed out that, the above analysis is performed based on the data of SARS coronavirus in air. Factors in human body are rather complex such as that there exist both factors favorable for immune or drug to react and that for the virus to replicate. Therefore, when developing a 4 . Thermally important temperature scale to kill SARS coronavirus treatment therapy in clinics, such comprehensive factors should be fully considered. In certain extreme situation such as in a high temperature environment, the SARS coronavirus can only survive for a short period. From Fig. 4 , when the temperature approaches 80\u00b0C, the predicted result shows that the SARS coronavirus will denature within 3 min. This conclusion has great importance for practice. We have proposed to heat a polluted room to completely kill the virus inside [31] . It seems now clear that, 80\u00b0C is an appropriate temperature to efficiently kill the virus. Killing the SARS coronavirus to clean the room is a new way of disinfection and produces no pollution to the environment. Such method is worth of investigation. Overall, the above results predicted from (33) accord well with the currently available measurement and observed phenomena [18] . Although the theoretical equation is founded from limited data, its efficiency in prediction is satisfactory. Theoretically, the time for the SARS coronavirus to live falls in an extremely wide range, but not just the currently reported value. This time depends on the magnitudes of the P, E a and T and the physical and chemical factors capable of changing these parameters. However, we should point out that, the experimental tests are still far from being enough, since different environmental factors and substrates will have effects on the survival time of the virus. Therefore, to completely understand the survival behavior of the SARS coronavirus, strictly defining the test conditions and perform corresponding work are still very necessary.",

For this purpose, uncertainties for the activation energy, temperature, frequency factor and degree of denature are all prescribed as 10%. Then the uncertainty of the predicted survival time at room temperature 25\u00b0C is Dt=t 0 \u00bc 0:88: Presented in Fig. 5 are estimated survival times for more situations. From that, one can find that the temperature and activation energy affect most to accurately predict the survival time. From (17), we can draw a conclusion that at a high temperature, the accuracy for predicting the survival time is also high, while at low temperature, the prediction accuracy will become worse or even have several times of errors. What appear more reliable from the theoretical prediction is the average survival time which overall reflects the reality. However, the real value usually fluctuates around this average magnitude. This conclusion would be very useful in correctly interpreting the current or future measured results. When in the air or in human body, if certain disinfector, acid and alkali substance, drug, bacterin, or some chemical and physical factors may induce variations of the activation energy and frequency of the SARS coronavirus, it is possible a simple heating process would kill the virus. On the contrary, the survival and replication capability of the SARS coronavirus may be significantly enhanced, its ability of anti-drug, heat resistance and infection will increase. Theoretically speaking, all these situations are possible. Parametric studies given in Fig. 6 show that, for different rate coefficients, survival time for the SARS coronavirus can vary in orders even under the same environmental temperature. Therefore, if one wishes to comprehensively analyze or test the survival behavior of the SARS coronavirus, the environmental conditions should be strictly defined.",

On the other hand, the phagocytosis on the virus due to immune regulation from the human body will also help to kill the virus. In fact, this is one of the most important factors for many SARS patients to survive. Presently, due to lack of specific medicine, the clinical treatment on SARS is still above all a kind of supporting therapy, whose essence is to regulate the immune reaction of the human body and thus finally destroy the SARS coronavirus.

As frequently observed, the SARS coronavirus tends to adhere to these tissues. Therefore, revealing the characteristics of the physiological solutions in these areas will help to better understand the attacking behaviors of the SARS coronavirus. Similarly, we can also explain the other SARS phenomena. For example, the reason leads to virus aberrance is perhaps because its rate process has been changed forever. For example, some studies show that, the infection ability for the filial generation becomes weak, which may reflect that the process has changed the rate coefficients such as P and E a . It looks the filial generation does have a decreased activation energy or a possibly increased frequency factor. However, the SARS coronavirus does can change to a converse aberrance. This is because an extremely small change in its structure will possibly vary its activation energy. When the above parameters appear to induce an increased viability of the SARS coronavirus, its survival time will be lengthened and the infectivity will be improved. This should be born in mind with caution and effective prevention measure should be made.",

If treating the SARS coronavirus deposited in the phlegm or saliva as also a part of this protein like agglomerate, then only when all the protein substances in the agglomerate were denatured can the packed SARS coronavirus be regarded as completely destroyed. In this way, one can predict the prolonged survival time of the SARS coronavirus deposited in phlegm or saliva. Substituting (5) into (13), one obtains,",

Since the virus was contained in the phlegm or saliva, if only 90% of the protein substance become denatured, can it be said the virus was killed. Assuming the SARS coronavirus only takes up 10% volume of the total phlegm or saliva, one has a \u00bc 10: Then the increased survival time for the virus will be ln 10 times of its original value. For example, an original survival time of 5 h will now increase to 5ln10 = 11.5 h. Therefore, cleaning away the environmentally existing phlegm or saliva is very necessary for the successful control of the SARS infection.",

Once the activation energy and frequency factor in a specific environment are available, one can perform predictions on the survival behavior of the SARS coronavirus in a wide variety of surrounding situations. The present theory appears useful not only for better understanding the spreading and survival mechanisms of the SARS coronavirus, it also suggests an important clue to develop efficient drugs, bacterin and clinical therapy. For example, if certain strategy capable of varying the activation energy, frequency factor and temperature of the SARS coronavirus can be found, it is very possible to set up a useful way for fighting the SARS. In fact, such effort has been reflected in the current SARS research activities. Compared to the ways of developing bacterin and drug, physical therapy appears much direct in its output results. For example, by testing the killing effect of a group of various physical factors to the in vitro and in vivo SARS coronavirus, it is possible to quickly screen out useful engineering approaches for treating the SARS. The currently available approaches worthy of trying are as follows [31] : Based on the temperature sensitivity of the SARS coronavirus, one can develop various heating methods for the hyperthermia and disinfection purposes; While from the non-thermal effects produced by the electromagnetic wave (static or dynamic electric stimulation, radio frequency), the optical wave (laser or violet), acid and alkali environment (by varying the pH value), the mass diffusion (high concentration oxygen or human tolerable disinfector), or delivered target substance (drug or bacterin) etc., one can also find useful ways to intervene the rate process of the SARS coronavirus and then successfully prevent or cure it. Similarly, if certain specific substance was found to react with the samples containing SARS coronavirus and produce an easily detectable physical chemical mass, one can establish a quick diagnostic method on the SARS in clinics.",

            "text": "It is a good way to quantitatively characterize the denaturation or replication behavior of SARS coronavirus through the rate process theory. Based on the limited experimental data on survival time, the activation energy and frequency factor for the SARS coronavirus in a specific environment can be estimated and then applied to predict more information inaccessible through experiment. The currently available experimental data for the survival times of SARS coronavirus is very limited, and the measurements only reflect certain specific cases. It is very necessary to perform systematic tests on the survival times of SARS coronavirus subject to electric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, thermal or acid-alkali effects with different strengths. Only in this way, can the data bank for the activation and factor be established. The current data for the survival times of the SARS coro-navirus provided by different labs appears a little disperse from each other. Their accuracy is in need of re-evaluation. One possible way can be that, the same SARS coronavirus from the only source should be distributed to multiple labs over the world for independent tests on the survival time of the sample under the same experimental conditions strictly defined. In this way, deviation from each test can be tested and thus allows for a comprehensive understanding on the SARS coronavirus. Such strategy will also be helpful for testing the variability of SARS coronavirus. The causes to kill the SARS coronavirus can be attributed to the effects of changing the activation energy and frequency factor. Any drug or engineered way capable of inducing a death of SARS coronavirus will be beneficial for the treatment of SARS. Therefore, it is critical to perform experimental study on the survival or replication of SARS coronavirus either in vivo or vitro. Through a comprehensive analysis on the effects of various physical and chemical factors, one can establish the possible drug or engineering way. Although the present study is mainly for the SARS coronavirus, behaviors for any general virus to attack its host cell are approximately similar to each other and therefore can be described by the rate process theory. Analysis given in this paper will be beneficial in quantifying the physical or chemical behavior of SARS coronavirus. Up to now, little is known in this area. The present study provides a new theoretical foundation.",

            "text": "Zusammenfassung Der Kenntnisstand \u00fcber die Eigenschaften des in 2003 neu aufgetretenen SARS Korona Virus, der einige Hundert Menschenleben gekostet hat, ist relativ gering. Die Ermittlung des Denaturierungs-und Replizierungsmechanismuses des SARS Virus ist f\u00fcr seine Bek\u00e4mpfung von hoher Bedeutung. Experimentelle Untersuchungen an diesem extrem gef\u00e4hrlichen Virus d\u00fcrfen nur durch Laboratorien mit einem hohen Sicherheitsstandard erfolgen. Die Vorhersage des Verhaltens des SARS Virus in unterschiedlichen Umgebungsbedingungen ist dabei erforderlich. In der vorliegenden Studie wird die \u00dc berlebensdauer des Virus unter Labor-und realen Bedingungen durch Anwendung der bekannten Arrhenius-Beziehung f\u00fcr temperaturabh\u00e4ngige Vorg\u00e4nge ermittelt. Das physikalische und chemische Verhalten des SARS Virus wird anhand der zugrundeliegenden Modell-Parameter beschrieben. Basierend auf den ersten Messungen von Mitgliedern des WHO-laboratory-network \u00fcber die Stabilit\u00e4t und Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit des Virus wurden erstmalig die Geschwindigkeitskoeffizienten des Berechnungsmodells bestimmt. Vorhersagen der \u00dc berlebensdauer des SARS-Virus unter unterschiedlichen Temperaturbedingungen wurden ausgef\u00fchrt. Das sich hieraus ergebende, sehr unterschiedliche Ausma\u00df der \u00dc berlebensf\u00e4higkeit in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Umgebungstemperatur ist durch den Vergleich mit verf\u00fcgbaren experimentellen Ergebnissen best\u00e4tigt worden. Die Anwendung der vorgestellten Modellierung zur Interpretation realer Ph\u00e4nomene und zur Entwicklung technischer Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Vorbeugung und klinischen Therapierung von SARS wird diskutiert. Der Einflu\u00df von Unsicherheiten des Modells wird analysiert und abgesch\u00e4tzt. Parametrische Studien sind durchgef\u00fchrt worden, um den Einflu\u00df der Geschwindigkeitskoeffizienten auf die \u00dc berlebensdauer des SARS Virus darzustellen. Einige wichtige Einflu\u00dfgr\u00f6\u00dfen auf die Denaturierung und Replikationsf\u00e4higkeit des SARS Virus werden aufgezeigt. Durch eine Variation der Modellparameter kann die potentielle Wirksamkeit medika-ment\u00f6ser oder physikalischer Therapien abgesch\u00e4tzt werden. Erweiterungsm\u00f6glichkeiten des vorgestellten Modells werden vorgeschlagen. Die vorliegende Studie erm\u00f6glicht neue, theoretische Vorgehensweisen zur Untersuchung des komplexen Verhaltensmusters des SARS Virus.",
