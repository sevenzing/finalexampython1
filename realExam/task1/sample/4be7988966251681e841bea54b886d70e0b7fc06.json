In the UK, care homes do not have standard specifications for medical cover nor doctors in residence and, despite improvements in GP support associated with the Enhanced Health in Care Homes programme 16 , the level of support that can be delivered remains variable. Whilst many care homes already care for residents on low flow oxygen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have standard operating procedures for this, this is not the case for subcutaneous fluids. It is unclear whether staff can be provided with necessary competencies and have capacity to take on such extended roles in the midst of a crisis. This could, however, be an opportunity for better partnership working between care homes and community healthcare professionals, for example, GPs, nurses, geriatricians, dementia specialists, and palliative care teams. It is clear, though, that multiple visiting professionals are suboptimal in the context of a pandemic and the crisis has further",

Some care homes have reported a 10-fold increase in mortality during the COVID outbreak, with up to a quarter of residents dying within a week. Three quarters of UK health and social care staff surveyed during the pandemic felt that government could have done more to support them and up to a fifth had considered leaving their profession as a consequence of COVID-19 17 . If we are to avoid significant mental health issues for care home staff at the end of the pandemic and retain motivated and expert staff in the sector then systematic, high-quality psychological support for them needs to be built into our international response to COVID-19.",

For each UK example reported in this commentary, there are similar experiences in the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands and reports from the care home sector internationally suggest that there have been similar experiences in many countries 19 . It is clear that we have some way to go, in the UK and internationally, to ensure that the sector is adequately recognised, resourced, equipped and integrated with acute healthcare provision to play its role as a cornerstone of health and social care. Political will to address this has hitherto been lacking. The hope is that learning and insights from the hard work of the care home sector through the COVID pandemic will provide long overdue impetus. ",
