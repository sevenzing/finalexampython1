Over the past ten years, several independent external reviews, as well as a number of internal commissions, have examined the IO's activities. Multiple reports have been produced and recommendations have been posed on how the WHO should be reformed. The organisation's secretariat, and specifically its director-general, has in turn responded to these proposals by outlining various steps to redress the problems that have been identified. Many of these corrective measures were 'in progress' at the time of writing. This is not the first time the WHO has faced such questions or, indeed, extensive criticism. Even so, the fact that the IO's member states, nongovernment organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations (CSOs), are once again questioning the intrinsic value of the WHO is nevertheless alarming. Indeed, a perception has increasingly emerged that something has 'gone wrong' with the organisation, to the extent that reforming the",

            "text": "Since late 2003 and the re-emergence and the global spread of the H5N1 'Bird Flu' virus, governments around the world had been preparing for another influenza pandemic. The aetiological agent that caused the next pandemic though was not the much-feared H5N1 virus but rather a novel strain of influenza H1N1 that emerged in La Gloria, a small rural village in Veracruz, Mexico, in March 2009 . From this remote location, the virus spread worldwide within weeks, carried by international travellers to initiate outbreaks in over 200 locations worldwide (WHO 2013) . The WHO's handling of the 2009 influenza pandemic attracted criticism both during the crisis and in its aftermath. Moreover, in response to concerns the IO had been unduly influenced into declaring a pandemic by experts with links to the pharmaceutical industry, a total of three internal and external investigations were launched into the organisation's management of the crisis (WHO 2011; Flynn 2010; Cohen and Carter 2010) . All three investigations subsequently concluded there was no evidence the WHO had engaged in inappropriate conduct. Nevertheless, each of these independent panels recommended amendments on how the IO responded to future health emergencies. While some of these measures have been enacted, in hindsight, it is now clear that there were at least two significant, related 'mistakes' in the WHO's management of the 2009 pandemic: the first being the WHO's decision to label the responsible aetiological agent 'swine flu' and, the second, to remove guidelines from the WHO website after a policy discrepancy was identified.",

In an explicit attempt to avoid the risk the 2009 influenza pandemic would be labelled the 'Mexican Flu' (on account that Mexico was the location where the disease first appeared), the WHO secretariat initially settled on identifying the pandemic with the animal that is most closely associated with the H1N1 virus: pigs. Accordingly, for the first few weeks of the 2009 crisis, the pandemic was extensively described by the WHO and international media outlets as 'Swine Flu' (Cohen 2009b; Butler 2009 ).",

Indeed, within weeks of the descriptor being applied, approximately 20 per cent of the WHO's member states implemented a series of measures that exceeded, and thereby contravened, international norms (Davies et al. 2015) . In late April 2009, for example, the Egyptian government ordered the mass culling of all pigs throughout the country (estimated to be between 250,000 and 400,000 animals) as a 'preventative measure', despite the fact that no human cases of H1N1 had been recorded in Egypt nor any reported outbreaks of H1N1 had occurred in pigs worldwide (Katz and Fischer 2010) . Within days, the Iraqi government followed Egypt's lead and ordered the culling of three boars in a Baghdad zoo (Karadesh 2009 ). Added to this, some 20 other countries including Russia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bahrain and China imposed trade import bans on all live pigs, pork and pork products, citing concerns over the risk that H1N1 may be introduced into their respective human populations (Lynn 2009; WTO 2009; Katz and Fischer 2010) .",

On 26 April 2009, for instance, the organisation issued a press release that emphasised that trade and travel restrictions were not recommended (WHO 2009e) . The next day the secretariat expanded on this, unequivocally stating, '[t] here is also no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products' (WHO 2009f). On 29 April 2009, a representative from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) went further, explicitly condemning the Egyptian government by describing the slaughter of the country's entire pig population a 'real mistake ' and stating '[t] here is no reason to do that' (Stewart 2009 ). To add further weight to this public messaging, the next day, the FAO, WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health issued a joint statement stipulating that pork and pork products were safe and that trade bans were unwarranted (FAO/WHO/ OIE 2009). This statement was then re-issued on 7 May 2009 to further reinforce the message (Ibid). Nonetheless, several countries persisted in applying live pig and pork import bans with the result that official complaints were formally lodged with the World Trade Organization (WTO) in late June 2009 (WTO 2009).",

Similarly, when questioned about their decision to slaughter three wild boars, a representative from the Iraqi zoo admitted that their actions were not based on science but were rather designed 'to break a barrier of fear' amongst zoo visitors (Karadesh 2009 ). The Philippines, which had banned pork imports from the USA, Mexico and Canada in late April 2009 as a 'precautionary measure' (Joshi 2009 ), lifted the ban within a week for the USA and Mexico but sought to justify their continued ban on Canada on the basis of a suspected case of swineto-human H1N1 infection (Ager 2009 ).",

Although the WHO secretariat had attempted to avoid the risk the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic would become known as the 'Mexican Flu', by selecting an alternative descriptor, the organisation had inadvertently instigated harmful trade and animal welfare practices. The fact that there was no clinical evidence of the 2009 H1N1 virus spreading between pigs and humans proved irrelevant; the damage had been done by drawing the correlation between pigs and the virus. Compounding the WHO's mistake, a small number of countries took the additional step of quarantining Mexican citizens in their respective countries, or prevented travel to and from Mexico, in an inept attempt to limit the virus' transmission. Although conceivably it could be argued the proportion of countries that engaged these latter measures was potentially smaller given the IO had acted so precipitously to negate the association being drawn between H1N1 and Mexico, it nevertheless proved only partially successful. In hindsight, therefore, it can be appreciated the IO's initial descriptor was not only a mistake that could have been predicted and easily avoided by selecting an alternative name (such as 'H1N1'), but it also failed to comprehensively repudiate an association between Mexico and the H1N1 virus (and the associated economic repercussions) that was emerging.",

Importantly, however, it took a number of months after the disease's identification in April 2009 before the lethality of the virus could be accurately determined. Concern over the severity of the virus and the risk to communities was also exacerbated by international media reports, particularly in the initial weeks; until sufficient data had been gathered and interpreted, it was unclear what measures were required to contain the disease and prevent unnecessary human morbidity and mortality.",

Since 1999 the WHO had actively encouraged countries to strengthen their pandemic preparedness and had released a series of guideline documents that detailed various measures designed to achieve that objective (i.e. building vaccine manufacturing capacity, stockpiling antiviral medications, developing national emergency committees, etc.). These guidelines were also important as they introduced a framework for how and when a pandemic would be declared by the IO, outlining the multiple stages and decision points (described as 'phases') such as 'limited human-to-human transmission' through to widespread, sustained community-level infection (WHO 1999a (WHO , 2005 (WHO , 2009c . Somewhat ironically, the WHO secretariat had released the latest version of these pandemic influenza guidelines only a few months before the first recorded outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico. One of the crucial factors cited in the most recent version of the guidelines for declaring a pandemic though had been an assessment of the severity of a virus.",

On 29 April 2009, the IHR emergency committee recommended the directorgeneral raise the alert level from Phase 4 (community-level outbreaks) to Phase 5 (sustained community transmission), which was promptly actioned. According to the WHO's guidelines though, the declaration of Phase 5 was also intended to send 'a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent' (WHO 2009c: 25) . The elevation of the alert level to Phase 5 was immediately queried by a number of critics, principally because the epidemiological data increasingly suggested that the H1N1 virus caused only mild illness in the majority of cases. In fact, by early May 2009, although there were a number of suspected deaths, only 61 H1N1-related fatalities had been verified by laboratory testing, with most infected people experiencing symptoms that were more akin to a seasonal variety of influenza (WHO 2009b). When then asked by a CNN reporter to explain the decision to declare Phase 5 in the light of the fact the WHO had previously maintained a pandemic entailed large numbers of human fatalities and severe illness, the response of the secretariat was to delete its guidelines from its website (Cohen 2009a) .",

As preparations for the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) got under way in May though, disquiet about the secretariat's behaviour grew. Assessing a more robust response was needed, the WHO director-general convened an urgent high-level consultation immediately prior to the WHA to review the data and processes used by the secretariat and IHR emergency committee (WHO 2009d).

The accusation further reinforced governments' earlier concerns by insinuating that the director-general had been improperly influenced into declaring a pandemic. Attempting to deflect this latest controversy, senior WHO officials initially publicly advocated that shielding the identities of the IHR emergency committee members was 'to protect the committee from outside influences' Carter 2010: 1278) . The argument was not sufficiently persuasive though, given the allegations had raised concerns over perceived conflicts of interest. As a result, two further external independent reviews were launched by the Council of Europe and a joint investigation by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ). In early June 2010, these investigations handed down their findings, provoking the director-general to issue a strongly worded statement refuting the allegations that had been made and reaffirming that '[t]he world is going through a real pandemic. The description of it as a fake is wrong and irresponsible' (WHO 2010).",

Even so, as discussed below, a number of the more substantive changes to how the WHO functioned during health emergencies such as the creation of a health emergency contingency fund (HECF) were not implemented due to resistance by member states or inadequate resources, and this in turn was revealed to have adverse impacts on the organisation's management of the next major health emergency: the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In fact, the WHO is widely considered to have 'failed' the international community during the EVD outbreak. The criticisms that emerged have largely centred around the notion that the IO was far too slow to respond to the crisis, and although some have sought to provide additional context for why this occurred (Kamradt-Scott 2016), the perception has nevertheless persisted. In the following section, this chapter surveys two of the WHO's most apparent failings during the Ebola outbreak: first, an unwillingness to challenge official reports and, second, a lack of adequate coordination that contributed to the spread of the virus.",

This delay permitted the virus to circulate undetected for some three months and, as a result, had spread across border regions into neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone. Initially suspected to be Lassa Fever, within hours of confirming that the aetiological agent was Ebola, the WHO secretariat in Geneva mobilised a response team via the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to deploy to Guinea to assist local health authorities. The secretariat also alerted Liberian and Sierra Leonean health officials to commence surveillance. On 27 March 2014, both Liberia and Sierra Leone confirmed they had identified a small number of suspected EVD cases.",

The Guinean government then went even further, explicitly rejecting MSF's assertions that the outbreak was 'out of control' (Fofana 2014 ).

Later, when the Guinean health minister asserted at the WHA that his country's epidemic was now under control, the IO again failed to contest this claim, accepting the health minister's declaration. Between the end of the WHA and two weeks later on 10 June 2014, however, Guinea and Sierra Leone recorded approximately 150 new infections, bringing the cumulative total to 440 suspected or confirmed EVD cases.

Although the aim in the immediate post-war period had been to dissolve all pre-existing international health organisations to make way for the new universal health agency, representatives from the Bureau staunchly resisted the idea. The negotiations took three years to conclude, with the Bureau finally acceding to become the Americas regional office of the WHO in 1949.

In response, the AFRO secretariat advocated that the regional director declare an 'internal WHO Grade 2 emergency' and establish a regional emergency support team to coordinate technical and operational support. This action plan was approved the same day (AFRO 2014a); yet by 5 May 2014, whereas the WHO secretariat in Geneva had deployed almost 90 staff to Guinea, only 20 were sent to Liberia, 1 was dispatched to Sierra Leone and 4 were sent to the regional office.

Indeed, somewhat ironically, the AFRO had updated and released their standard operating procedures (SOPs) for responding to disease outbreaks in March 2014 (AFRO 2014d). These new SOPs, which emphasised the importance of quality and consistency in managing adverse events (Ibid: 11), stipulated that AFRO had the responsibility for conducting regional risk assessments and coordinating the response to outbreaks affecting the region-in contrast, as noted in the SOPs, to WHO headquarters that had responsibility for global risk assessments and response (Ibid: 14) . Yet, as Gostin (2015b Gostin ( : 1904 notes, 'AFRO did not convene health ministers or open a regional coordination centre until 3 months after Ebola was confirmed in Guinea'. By this stage, the virus had spread to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia where, due to poor surveillance and response systems, the pathogen went on to infect thousands. Thus, whether due to obfuscation, intransigence or negligence, the AFRO secretariat's slack of adherence to their own standards proved a costly mistake.",

Arguably, however, while the regional office attracted the ire of some, the majority of criticism was levelled at the WHO staff in Geneva. By September 2014, for instance, the IO's response was being described extensively by a wide range of external commentators as slow and ineffectual (Anonymous 2014; Sack et al. 2014) . While the director-general publicly attempted to defend her organisation by stressing that the agency was not the 'first responder' (Fink 2014) , these perceptions were not aided by the unauthorised release of an internal review that identified 'severe shortcomings' in the WHO's response (Cheng 2014) . Further mistakes were then uncovered in March 2015 with the publication of the AP investigation that revealed staff in Geneva had actively resisted attempts to declare the event a global public health emergency over concerns that it may antagonise the affected countries (Cheng and Satter 2015) . Collectively, the multiple reports and revelations consolidated the perception amongst many world leaders that the WHO had 'failed' the international community, prompting the UN secretary-general to take an unprecedented action in establishing the United Nations' first ever public health mission (UNMEER), while other countries deployed military personnel to assist with the response .",

Disturbingly, very many of the recommendations produced by these commissions echoed the practical steps for enhancing global health security advanced by the various H1N1 review panels four years earlier. Critically though, the majority had not been acted upon, raising the question of whether the EVD outbreak could have been contained sooner, saving lives (Ottersen et al. 2016) . To what extent, therefore, was the failure to enact these earlier recommendations the fault of the WHO secretariat? Was this yet another of the organisation's mistakes?

To redress these identified weaknesses, the independent panels and commissions suggested various remedies extending from increasing member states' annual payments (otherwise described as 'assessed contributions'), refining the IO's work priorities, establishing a new global health emergency workforce (GHEW), creating an HECF, increasing the secretariat's transparency and accountability, amongst others. For its part, the WHO bureaucracy responded to a number of the proposals, outlining measures it believed could reasonably be taken to address the problems identified (WHO 2016b).",

Likewise, the decision to remove influenza policy guidelines when discrepancies were identified, presumably as part of some (misguided) media strategy, rests exclusively with the secretariat. These initial mistakes were then further compounded during Ebola with a combination of obstructive interpersonal and intraorganisational dynamics adversely impacting the response and an aberrant willingness to accept member states' unverified claims as to how well the outbreak was contained. Collectively, these mistakes suggest a risk-averse, reactionary bureaucracy and one highly protective of the organisation's reputation.

While there are certain circumstances whereby the bureaucracies are able to periodically 'shirk' the preferences of their member states, equally, governments have a variety of means-or 'control mechanisms'-at their disposal to reign in, even punish, IOs that are perceived to enjoy too much autonomy (Barnett and Finnemore 2004; Oestreich 2012a) . These control measures habitually include assorted legislative and economic instruments inserted into the organisations' design at the time of their creation to allow member states to shape and direct how the IOs behave (Schermers and Blokker 2003) . This is not to suggest, however, the WHO secretariat is powerless to effect change in the face of member state intransigence. Indeed, there have been a number of examples whereby the IO has acted against the expressed desires of governments, even the most powerful and influential. Two notable instances include the production of the 2000 World Health Report that ranked member states' health systems and the director-general's decision to publicly 'name and shame' China during the 2003 SARS outbreak. In each instance, repercussions from member states followed (Kamradt-Scott 2015), but the secretariat was able to exert its own influence on matters the director-general considered especially important.",

Throughout 2015 the secretariat undertook consultations to secure agreement to enact these initiatives, and at least initially, both appeared to enjoy strong support (WHO 2015b). As a result, both the GHEW and HECF were formally launched in 2016. Yet despite multiple pledges of support throughout the WHA and regional committee meetings, by 2017, both schemes have failed to attract the requisite funding to make them viable (WHO 2017).

Similarly, the labelling of H1N1 initially as 'swine flu' resulted in a series of unintended consequences, whereas the aversion to challenging member states' official reports during the West African EVD outbreak proved disastrous and was fundamentally motivated more by politics than technical incapacity.

This new initiative seeks to develop a new organisation-wide policy framework for responding to health emergencies as well as recruit new specialised personnel that will be distributed across the IO's central headquarters, regional offices and country offices. As outlined in the proposal that member states have endorsed, '[i]n high-vulnerability, low-capacity countries, WHO offices will have dedicated staff to support Member States with their work in all-hazards preparedness and response capacity building' (WHO 2016c: 3). To accomplish this, the WHE 'will require the recruitment of a substantial number of additional staff, with new skill sets' than the IO currently retains (Ibid: 6). These new resources-both human and policyare intended to ensure that on-the-ground assessments are conducted within 72 hours of official notification of a possible 'high-threat pathogen' (Ibid: 4). More broadly, the new programme and its personnel are expected to 'bring speed and predictability to WHO's emergency work, using an all-hazards approach, promoting collective action, and encompassing preparedness, readiness, response and early recovery activities' (Ibid: 1).",

Although this may not be evidence of lesson learning per se, it is arguably a strong indication of an internal cultural shift. Indeed, the WHE offers the secretariat a strategic opportunity to realign its current riskaverse approach. If embraced, it may help the organisation to avoid repeating the type of mistakes discussed above. Like the GHEW and HECF though, the new WHE is also struggling to gain the necessary financial backing to see the programme fully operationalised (WHO 2017).

Besides external (financial) support though, there are still hurdles to be overcome, most poignantly effecting an internal cultural change from its standard slow and methodical work of standard and agenda-setting to adopt an emergency responder culture. It is a change that will not be easy and will likely take some time to attain. In the event that such a change can be realised though, and the organisation's past mistakes avoided, it bodes well for the international community and global health security. We can only hope it is the latter.",
