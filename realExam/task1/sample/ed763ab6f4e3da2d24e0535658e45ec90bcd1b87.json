Rich and Wanyoike (2010) investigated the economic impacts to the stakeholder along the supply chain for the 2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya. They concluded that on a macroeconomic basis, the Kenyan economy lost more than $32 million. Following the Saudi Arabia RVF outbreak in 2000, Rich and Wanyoike discuss the economic losses in the Somali Region of Ethiopia to be $132 million due to the trade losses of live animals. In a working paper by Hughes-Fraire et al. (2011) , they estimate the impacts of a hypothetical RVF outbreak in south-eastern Texas in the United States. Similar to this study, they used an epidemiological model combined with an agricultural sector partial equilibrium model and human health information. To model the epidemiological impacts, the authors used data from the 1999 West Nile virus outbreak. Furthermore, they used cost of illness data for influenza to arrive at the human economic impacts. They concluded that the total national welfare loss to the agricultural sector and the economic impacts to humans could range from between $0.1 billion and $2.3 billion. Additionally, the authors pointed out that these estimates are likely underestimated because not all susceptible livestock are evaluated, other damages to society (e.g. tourism), changes in consumer demand and international trade are not incorporated into the study. Figure 1 provides an overview of the economic assessment of an RVF outbreak in the United States. To estimate the economic impacts of the RVF outbreak, the output from the epidemiological model is incorporated into a multifaceted economic approach. Given the United States has not had a previous case and is currently free of RVF, agricultural production and the healthcare system is vastly different when compared to East Africa and the Middle East, and an epidemiological model is used to simulate hypothetical outbreaks. The general economic methodology relies on the use of a multimarket partial equilibrium model to assess the agricultural sector supplemented with an input-output economic model to account for regional disruptions on the non-agricultural sectors (Pendell et al., 2007) . 3 Typical animal disease costs to the governmentsuch as appraisal, indemnification and surveillanceare also calculated.

For this study, we assume two plausible unintentional release scenarios: (1) 10 RVFv-infected mosquitoes escape without detection and (2) a fire in a containment laboratory in which the RVFv escapes through the ventilation system. The first and second scenarios represent an unannounced and announced event, respectively. This is an important distinction as an unannounced release could continue to spread the virus until the disease is identified and confirmed by officials, while control and mitigation plans (e.g. increased surveillance) could be immediately implemented in the announced released. Due to the meteorological conditions, it is assumed the infected mosquitoes escaped late spring or summer. Table 4 reports the epidemiological results for two hypothetical RVF outbreaks to both human and animals. When 10 infected mosquitoes escape and initiate the outbreak, the mean number of humans infected is 71 while 208 cattle become infected. If a fire occurs in a research laboratory and the virus escapes as an aerosol, the impacts are much smaller as mitigation strategies are employed immediately. The mean number of humans and cattle that become infected for this scenario is 0.06 and 0.03, respectively (Table 4) . Because RVF outbreaks have only occurred Eastern African and Middle Eastern countries, which have much different agricultural production and human healthcare systems than the United States, it is difficult to compare these results.

In the research laboratory fire scenario, the producers' losses to capital and management and consumers' welfare gains were $1515.3 million and $2005.1 million, respectively.
